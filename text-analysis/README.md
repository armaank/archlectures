## Text analysis

Simple code and notebooks that perform basic textual analysis of two datasets. 

First, there is the `arch-lectures` dataset that consists of captured speech from
architecture lectures. We performed a basic UMAP clustering of word embeddings and didn't find anything interesting. 

The second dataset came from descriptions of projects from [ArchDaily](https://www.archdaily.com/). Using LDA we were able to generate semantically meaningful topic models. 

### Datasets
Run `python3 get_dataset.py` to pull the dataset of interest. You can then run the notebooks locally, or you can use them in colab. (insert hlink here)
