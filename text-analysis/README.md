## Text analysis

Simple code and notebooks that perform basic textual analysis of two datasets. 

First, there is the `arch-lectures` dataset that consists of captured speech from
architecture lectures. We performed a basic UMAP visualization of word embeddings and
didn't find anything interesting. [Colab

The second dataset came from descriptions of projects from
[ArchDaily](https://www.archdaily.com/). Using LDA we were able to generate semantically
meaningful topic models.  [Colab
