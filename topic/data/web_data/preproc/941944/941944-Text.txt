Text description provided by the architects. A simple floor plan emphasizes the rugged materiality of this elongated, cabin-style home in Valle de Bravo. When the homeowners approached Augusto Fernández Mas (K+A Diseño) and Mauricio Miranda (MM Desarrollos) to design a retreat in the Rancho Avandaro Country Club in Valle de Bravo, an hour-and-a-half outside of Mexico City, they nearly gave carte blanche.The clients just had three requests for their country house: a simple layout, low maintenance needs, and communal areas to be located on one floor. The resulting design places an emphasis on flow. The rooms and living areas are arranged in a successive order, guided by a dimly lit, dramatic hallway. Large windows that punctuate the minimal interior offer views of the bordering golf course.The materials, Japanese-style burnt wood, Canadian dark wood, and concrete, accentuate simplicity while simultaneously adding depth.
