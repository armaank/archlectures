Text description provided by the architects. The structure doesn’t exactly decide between being a stage, a room or a plaza. It is made of a series of plateaux and four façades with distinct characters. The overall volume recalls the nearby barracks but its language is nothing military. Essentially made of local wood, a careful use of paint clarifies the reading of the architectural elements. The coherence of the project is proudly loose and open to interpretation. Green and white plywood tiles become feathers towards the outside, horizontal stripes on the inside.A metal roof welcomes guests in, protects the stage, and provides support for two disco balls. One of the short façades looks like a rising moon, the other one recalls a white cat lying in the sun.
