Text description provided by the architects. A magnificently placed home in Aspen, Colorado, The Lookout was envisioned and configured to take advantage of panoramic views of the Elk Mountain Range and provide a pristine backdrop for the ownerâ€™s significant contemporary art collection.A strong central axis orients the flow of key interior spaces toward vistas and separates open public spaces from private living areas.A modern entry volume exposes the north side of the house to natural daylight and encourages ventilation, while creating a striking arrival with southern mountain views.
