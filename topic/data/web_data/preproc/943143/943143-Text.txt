Text description provided by the architects. A studio. A cube studio for a painter.In the center of a wooded area, a clear clean volume appears, measuring the scenery a 9-meter cube that must lodge in its interior void of triple-height, the life and the work of an artist, which requires a subdued light, to work with canvases of great magnitude.Â That is why the volume tends to close itself, to the north opening to the southern light, a steady light without brilliance. This orientation gives also the full view of the Villarica Volcano.Interior balconies, facing the open space, gives the surroundings for daily living, in a well incept aloofness. The project emerges from the search of conditions of equilibrium and rest. Finally, the austerity of a Cube, prevails, in a counterpoint of the natural exuberance of the location.
