“A new geometry for a new era of Mobility” This building is located along the national highway in the northern area of Osaka. It is a car showroom that mainly sells and maintains cars.Here, we have created a new architectural space and shape that incorporates the movement, scale, and speed of the car for a new era of Mobility.  In addition, by using traffic graphics and road materials, we have realized new architecture that is continuous with the city.
