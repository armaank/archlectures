Text description provided by the architects. Coletiza is a living universe built upon plural connections", that is the moto of this collective and collaborative shopping place formed by a group of four entrepreneurs.To design the perfect space for them, it was necessary to create something that could create a bond between the stores, wrapping this whole universe together inside a long old brick shed (50m long x 7m wide).This was possible with the construction of a conducting wall alongside the whole length of the building. A "ribbon" that not only creates the identity of Coletiza, but also creates spaces for display - shifting according to each store - changing cabinets and hidden support rooms.
