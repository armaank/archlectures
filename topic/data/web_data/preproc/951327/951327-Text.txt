Text description provided by the architects. The project Casa na Praça Mouzinho de Albuquerque represents the materialization of an exercise of spatial organization within an urban plot with a complex configuration.The location of the building - in one of the main squares in the historic center of Braga, in Portugal - determined the option to preserve the existing volume and façades, and also some characteristic elements inside. The intervention focused on accommodating a family program properly adjusted to the spatial needs and facilities that are currently required, finding in the existing volumetry a reason (not a condition) for the distribution and design of the spaces.At the back of the plot, a new construction appears that frees itself from the formal and plastic language of the existing, assuming at the same time a gesture of rupture and continuity with the existing building, by extending the material of the floor and the back facade.
