Text description provided by the architects. The new Tim Van Laere Gallery in Antwerp (BE) will occupy a central position on the New South district, a project by developer Triple Living.As a concatenation of rooms, the building ‘shows’ its structure in its silhouette. A storage space, offices, a white cube, a chapel, and a patio follow each other, as pure types of buildings where art can be experienced in different ways. The rooms are constructed as simple in-situ concrete boxes, isolated on the inside and lit by roof light.As an explicitly urban building, it is ambiguous and direct, with its gates directly on the street.The building makes a statement for both its immediate surroundings and inside; art is a central focal point and is immediately visible and accessible to everyone
