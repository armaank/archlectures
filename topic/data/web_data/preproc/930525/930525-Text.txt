Being the French concession provides the street with a narrative history in the old time, and the Wutong trees on the roadsides help it build a quiet environment in the busy city.The design is inspired by the peaceful atmosphere and the dynamic sunshine from the street.

The background made of white paint and light gray cement highlights the greens to be the core in the space.The design which blurs the boundary of interior and exterior provides customers with immersive experience being closer to nature.
