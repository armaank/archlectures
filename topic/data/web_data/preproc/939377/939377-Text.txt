It also provides open view from bedrooms gathering around this skylight to surround through a huge glass wall beside center green space, therefore naturally connect indoor life with outdoor coastal life.The kitchen and dining room are located at mezzanine floor to create the privacy for these areas and allow people to experience beautiful sea view through double volume void and full height glass wall & door at front .The living room on ground floor is created as a front yard that is filled with tree and light, with purpose to bring back Vietnamese traditional lifestyle in a modern house.Besides, using mainly local natural material creates the strong connection between building and this region, pave the way for friendly and sustainable life.
