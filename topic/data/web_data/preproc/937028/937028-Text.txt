We designed a "suspended" restaurant overlooking the Sagami Bay on the cliffs of the Izu Peninsula. Japanese terrain is complex, and various methods have been invented to reconcile terrain with architecture.“Suspension” is a method of constructing a building so that it floats on a steep slope, and Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto is a representative example. We made a transparent "suspension" using steel frames, and built a solid board of cypress up to 11.4 meters above it to float the roof.I was able to float a cloud-like architecture made of cypress on the green of the cliff. Chef Seizo Mikuni's dishes that make use of Izu's natural ingredients and the cypress-scented architecture create an exquisite harmony.
