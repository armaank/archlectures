Text description provided by the architects. Complex of two single-family houses situated on the shoreline of the lake. A plot of land with a south entrance and steep slope was a design challenge.The concept is to reverse the night and day zones. The night zone is on floor -1, while the day zone is available on floor 0. The building uses the natural terrain - it flows down with the surroundings. Thanks to this, the living area is higher and we get a greater panorama of the lake, and the two-storey blocks of buildings, partially hidden in the slope, do not disturb the scale of the town and fit into the existing area.A steep slope of the plot separates the private part of the gardens from the street, creating a calm green zone overlooking the lake. By using natural, noble materials such as wood, stone or brick, the buildings blend in with the surroundings and complement it.
