Text description provided by the architects. Set along a ridgeline with significant mountain views, Ridge House is a thoughtful blending of old and new. Sets of staggered, remnant stone walls run in a single direction, allowing light and landscape to slip past.Oriented along a central defining spine, metal walls meet stone and evolve into glass as movement through the house progresses from public to private spaces.Modern architecture mixed with curated details allows for a layering of history and a connection to the ranch-like character of the site.
