Text description provided by the architects. The design of this house located in Pilar is a product of the conflict between an extensive program for a large family and a limited size of land. With these requirements and conditions, from the beginning a buried level was projected to contain part of the program, especially the recreation areas, a large storage space and technical places.Â The ground floor has a conventional design and the high floor has service rooms that are qualified by generous green courtyards that oxygenate, illuminate and expand them.
