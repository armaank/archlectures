Text description provided by the architects. The project was born the minute I stepped on the site. When I looked at the surrounding trees, I had to bring that into the project.It revolves around the idea of a house suspended and camouflaged between the canopy of a series of tree trunks, elevating the common areas, including the pool, to create comfort and privacy.Â The large floor-to-ceiling windows bring the nature inside the house. However, the ground floor is not forgotten: It uses the topography of the site to create beautiful concrete steps, filled with water and plants, that surround the outdoor kitchen at the end of the terrain.
