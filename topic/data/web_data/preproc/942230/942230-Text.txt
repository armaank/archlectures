Text description provided by the architects. The living and working place for people in need of care was built in the 1970s as a gesamtkunstwerk in anthroposophical design language in the middle of the landscape around Lake Constance, Thurgau. Now a new restaurant building is to become the centre of social life.The dining hall stages the landscape: a columned hall made of ash wood, self-bracing, open all around, stands on a concrete base that grows out of the slightly sloping terrain.The furniture was developed especially for this project.
