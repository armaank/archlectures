The angled spaces that characterize the house were respected and reinterpreted through the new architecture. The original area is 140m2 and the proposal extends it to 300m2, mainly through the growth of the service facilities and the incorporation a second level that generates new bedrooms and complementary enclosures. Its structure is mainly based on reinforced concrete and steel structure, while its materials vary between wood, porcelain tiles and glass.In terms of its interior expression, the design seeks a balance between white’s neutrality and wood’s warmth.
