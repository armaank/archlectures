Text description provided by the architects. The three brick towers are a part of a new residential complex built on the site of the demolished Kauchuk factory. Buildings are formed around a city pond brought back to its historical place by the new masterplan.The architecture of the entire block is united by the facade matrix and a material palette.Kauchuk's deep facade creates large windows in apartments, keeping the interior safe from the extra sun and prying eyes. The shapes of the towers are designed to create a solid sculpture while their shell remains light and permeable.The building's cellular structure evokes an object that is rooted in an industrial context while capturing a natural character.
