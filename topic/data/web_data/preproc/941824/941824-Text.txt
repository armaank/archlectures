Text description provided by the architects. In a semi-rural surrounding land with a relatively accentuated pendent, the client requested a small house with a living room open to the kitchen and an en-suite bedroom.In order to create two small compartments it could, eventually, take advantage of the attic on the roof.The result was a polyhedron built on the slope of the land, using itâ€™s empty lower area to store agricultural tools and garden machines.The client has always valued two features in the construction: the roof and the attic; by converting these, we managed to bring a mezzanine and a double ceiling height to the room.The initial inspiration for this small cottage was www.polydrops.com .
