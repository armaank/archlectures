Text description provided by the architects. We designed a DESCENTE BLANC shop-in-shop at Stellar Place, a shopping mall in Sapporo. While it is the smallest among all the DESCENTE BLANC stores, we took advantage of its relatively wide storefront to display the merchandize effectively by installing a vertically movable hanger bar system perpendicular to the storefront.A stockroom and a fitting room are located in one of the remaining spaces, concealed behind the curtains inspired by construction site gates made of tarpaulin and steel frames.A cash register counter is placed at the other remaining space along with a vertically movable store sign, the first of its kind used at the DESCENTE BLANC stores.
