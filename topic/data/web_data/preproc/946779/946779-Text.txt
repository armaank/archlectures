Text description provided by the architects. The house is small and open to the outside. We thought that there was a free and lively life by incorporating nature and the environment of the city into life. We have considered energy efficient homes that make good use of the environment, rather than energy consuming homes, by reducing the area of the home. How do you design between homes, how do you think about relationships with neighbors and society. As a solution, we proposed a large deck that connects the houses.In addition, we considered contact points with the local community so that our daily lives become the core of the neighborhood and region while protecting privacy. Japan is an era of declining birthrate and aging population. When designing a house, there is a need for a house that can accommodate not only the child-rearing generation but also various households.
