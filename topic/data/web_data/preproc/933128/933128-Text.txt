Text description provided by the architects. The Falafel Booth is located among food shops in front of Recoleta cemetery. The white crisscrossed mesh creates a plain surface with one opening.The project is a cladding and a window. During the day, when open, what is plain gains depth. Behind is the kitchen where the falafel is prepared to be sold on the street.Once sold out, the window shuts: the surface is again complete and everything behind lays hidden once again.
