Text description provided by the architects. The project is located on Srinakarin Road, one of the main roads of Southern Bangkok not far from Suvarnabhumi Airport with connection to the airport rail link. It targets at both travelers who stay within this semi-suburban area and who would make a journey further to the central. Lining in a row on the narrow plot of land, this 7-storey hotel with rooftop is divided into two buildings, connecting by a hotel lobby. The second floor consists of a dining area and a service counter while 92 guest rooms are on the upper floors. On the rooftop of the front building is a place for a control room but the rooftop of the back building provides space for meeting and banquet. The overall utility space is 5,365 square meters. Black and grey tones aluminum composite panels, wooden patterns and stainless steel perforated sheets cover the hotel’s outer shell. The façade superbly reflects light as these different materials are arranged randomly: no systematic order for patterns, colors, shades of opacity or transparency from floor to ceiling, from left to right and from front to back. Many hotel guests are usually familiar with the typical interior and floor plan, the representative of repetition in hotel design that sometimes leave no choices for new creation, but this unusual outer appearance expresses the state of the almost complete chaos and thus stimulate their new perception on the building’s physicality. It is undeniable that commercial buildings such as hotels require highly positive public recognition. Thus, physical appearance is crucially important for public relations, particularly for this hotel where the good location, the use of modern materials and the design methods aim to enhance guests’ perception and experience. As the interior design may require a compromise, the exterior must play a key role in making good impression, encouraging guests to recall their memories and to return for their next visits.
