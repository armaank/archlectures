Text description provided by the architects. AL - HOUSE is a private residence located in Bandung, Indonesia, in which the design approach is to build a simple, modern, and unique looking house with a triangular shape facade and asymmetrical roof. This design also seeks to answer the clients’ wishes regarding security and privacy, which became the main requirements.It interpreted into a seemingly enclosed facade design yet not entirely massive, seen with several openings from the front. Most of their spaces opening are on the side of the building. In response to the situation which is directly adjacent to the residential area, AL - HOUSE is designed with an inward orientation, so that interruption from the street or neighbor will not decrease the residents’ enjoyment of their homeThe house was constructed on an elongated plot of land with a 225 sqm area (9 meters length x 25 meters width), making this residence compactly designed so that it can meet all the needs. It has a linear room organization and we tried to bring an inner court concept as a central mass of the building, therefore, we call it compact. The courtyard accommodates the living entities such as natural light, fresh air, and the occurrence of cross-circulation which enhances positive energy for the occupants to become better and healthier.The main bedrooms are placed at the back of the site emphasizing user privacy in this two-floor house. Considering the elderly, the first floor consists of a parent's main bedroom (client's parent) and common room, whereas another main bedroom, two children's bedroom, and supporting room are on the second floor. Each room adjoins the void and/or inner court, so every room gets lighting and natural ambiance.
