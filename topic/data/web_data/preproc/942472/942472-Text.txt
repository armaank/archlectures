Text description provided by the architects. A small house in size but big in memories, in the moments lived there with friends and family.In the desire to have a large hanging garden or a small organic garden in the corridor, connected with technology and environmental issues.A fragile and delicate structure, dressed with layers of memories, references, small fragments brought from places visited and full of vital elements for well-being.Ventilated, illuminated, free from excesses but with warmth and the identity of those who always return home as a balanced, sustainable refuge, integrated with the environment and the city where it is but with a cutout and a particular identity, with benefits that hectic and frantic day-to-day life in the metropolises no longer brings them.
