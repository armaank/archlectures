Text description provided by the architects. In 2013, the new north access entry at the Solna station opened for commuter rail passengers to the Mall of Scandinavia and Friends Arena Stadium, among others. AIX Arkitekter designed the entrance for Jernhusen and now it needed to be completed with a building for garbage as it became too time consuming for the cleaning workers to get up to the station building on the bridge. In addition, new businesses wanted to use the station's former garbage space so now everybody can enjoy a cup of coffee there while the landlords have a more easily accessible and beautiful recycling station on the ground floor.The building is located adjacent to the existing elevator to the bridge. In addition to its function, the new small building contributes to a more comfortable and safer environment for those using the elevator, providing atmospheric lighting and refuge against the high-speed trains that rushÂ  just a few meters beside.The assignment included finding a material and construction method that could withstand graffiti, fire and general destruction in a good way but still have aesthetic qualities. Recycled glass crusher for a recycling station felt natural in this tough environment next to the embankment with its stone crusher, concrete and fast trains. The glass walls allowed us to illuminate from within which gives the material and the place an exciting shimmer during the dark hours of the day. The exterior walls and ceilings are gabion cages filled with crushed recycled glass.
