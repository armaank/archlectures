Demolition wood was put on the floor and in the wet areas, hidraulic bricks.On the bathroom wall a mosaic was made with old tiles that belonged to the owner´s grandmother.From the entrance hall, under the stairs, turning into the TV room, was built a concrete bench used at the same time as sideboard and rack and integrating the hall with the living room.The top floor was designed for receiving friends. A room, before hidden by a wall, was opened during the construction and used as a home theater, its walls and ceiling were kept in raw concrete, giving it a relaxed feeling.
