Text description provided by the architects. A showstopping office building in the suburbs. The project amplified the company’s brand identity - strength and integrity - through an honest material palette and a simplified form. The bank’s new headquarters was designed in response to the company’s revitalized brand identity; a sleek and minimalist black and white logo package and a refreshed commitment to sustainability. Set in a suburban location, the building aims to contrast the neighboring architecture through simplified form, a timeless material palette, and refined detailing.  The building’s location on the site allows for optimal solar orientation, allowing for an infusion of natural light throughout. A weathered zinc shawl floats above an all-glass base, while the interior features a double-height lobby with white oak accents, highlighted by a steel plate stair cantilevered from a velvet, exposed concrete cast-in-place core.Materials were selected for their permanence and stability, a physical manifestation of the bank’s stable and solid reputation in the community.
