The client is an indie studio of youngsters working in cinematography and ads. The task is to create not only an ordinary working office, but also an flexibly multi-functional space including movie show, DJ station, coffee shop, exhibition, event...The architect decide to insert a steel structure into the historical envelope, enhancing the space to be the main working space upstairs viewing the century-old trees; and to expose the layers of time by removing the damaged ceiling made of cement and wire mesh to feature the roof structure, this uniquely handmade wire mesh to be featured for wall lamps and floor tiles, by exposing layers of the old plaster wall, by maintaining the original wooden doors and windows. The multi-functional space to lie right under the main working space with sliding polycarbonate panels to open/close/divide for abilities, as well as to create a fluid filter somehow.

The spirals staircase vertically connects spaces_downstairs to upstairs, indoor to outdoor, old to new, under the roof to the above, with a sky of mixture like the city itself.
