Text description provided by the architects. The new Melk Coffee Bar was not only a design-thinking tightrope walk between necessity and esthetics but a reminder of how much thought can go into aspects of design that people might overlook. The difficult space had to fit an existing brand and be elevated for future rollouts.A triangular floor plan with a curved wall and space tapering to 2’ wide made for strict tolerances. We took a production line-style approach, putting sleek machines on display, with a consumer path encouraging browsing and employee-client interaction.Tables near the counter are raised to bar height on platforms and benches push ergonomic limits to meet a 24-person occupancy. The original space was cramped. Our esthetic approach emphasized the timelessness of raw materials within a limited palette.We turned the narrowing end into the back store and uncovered everything--architectural details, raw concrete, plumbing, and 14’ ceilings. Light paint, atypical use of ceramics, and wood provide organic accents.
