Text description provided by the architects. The owner is a landowner in Rokko and he hoped to live with his neighbors in the community.  So we planned a detached rental house. To think about how to create a house for someone, we analyzed 1,200 surveys on the theme of "comfort" and we planned some bay window spaces in the house. In this way, we aimed to create a house where life is loosely connected to the community.
