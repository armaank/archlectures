Text description provided by the architects. Since a ski accident, the client is in a wheelchair. Touched with 4 limbs, he had to negotiate with his handicap to rebuild himself, until he became an athlete. He is a member of the French Olympic Quad Rugby team.The project shows a virtuous, balanced negotiation between Architect/Customer/Disability, avoiding giving the last word to the disability. The result is a designed space that takes into account, without suffering them, the constraints of mobility.Paradoxically, these constraints, due to their combined particularities, are the hallmark of this project.
