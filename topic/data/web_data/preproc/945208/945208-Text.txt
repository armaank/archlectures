Text description provided by the architects. Customers wanted a leisure annex to a country house that already existed in the rural region of Jaru, in RondÃ´nia. The needs program is reduced, with kitchen, bathrooms and a large open area to receive friends and family. The site, with a slightly sloping topography, had a large lake that was the starting point for the creation of architecture.The project consists of a metallic structure in porticoes lined up with a thermoacoustic tile cover and natural wood lining. At the bottom of the composition, we created a swimming pool overlooking the lake.
