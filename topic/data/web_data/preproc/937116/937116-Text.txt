Text description provided by the architects. This project of a total transformation of an apartment could be like a change of life.It is a reflection undertaken with the client on the ergonomy of the rest areas, the "everyday rooms", the generosity of the luminous shared space, the creation of a landscape, an "open valley" above the kitchen, and the creation of storage spaces integrated into this thickness.Here, no walls, just surfaces that can be walked on.
