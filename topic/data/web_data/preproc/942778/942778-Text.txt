Text description provided by the architects. The design of the building uses an organizational scheme directly related to the structural matrix of the territory and more decisively the tree formations which are the most prevalent and enhanced elements of the site.An outdoor space was created and associated with each unit, enabling and independence for children with mobile disabilities. In addition to these spaces, interior patios were created as well. Common services used by the students and teachers are located in the central   axis of the building complex. The central  axis in a longitudinal direction that relates to the slope  of  the  terrain and  contains the common areas  or  services such  as library, cafeteria and  a central   space  for teachers   to  access all  the  other   components of the complex.This route is distinguished vertically in two levels, the first level for the students and at the second level, for the teachers.
