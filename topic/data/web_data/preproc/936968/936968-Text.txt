Text description provided by the architects. A small apartment midway down the hall in a horizontal property must double it`s habitable space in order to become a home/office.The main operation is than to complete the volume by means of a light, transparent structure, as well as the colonization of the terraces with a simple flooring, the result is more than enough meter for the house to develop.Two spaces are left without a use inside this surplus. With the goal of charging them with evocative meaning, we position inside them two pieces of landscape; a tree, and a glass screen.On the ground floor, the olive tree afects visually the rooms it articulates. On the first floor, the glass screen functions as a veil to and fro the bedroom, where aided by a game of reflections, opacities and transparencies, the space is projected towards the terraces.
