Text description provided by the architects. The appearance of a perfectly standard agricultural hangar calls for multiple programs.The breeding vat room and the partially buried stocks; above, the place of harvest and maceration vats as well as agricultural machinery storage; the tasting room which looks at them; the house of the winegrower; guesthouses.The only exception to this rigorous organization: the small tunnel where barrels are stored, invisible, and precious.
