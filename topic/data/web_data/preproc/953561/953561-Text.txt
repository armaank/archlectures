Text description provided by the architects. The ocean is the most striking feature of the landscape surrounding the Sao Felix Apartment. The breathtaking views are accentuated by a rather sober intervention in terms of material expression. The common areas in the apartment (living room, dining room and kitchen) are arranged around a standalone volume, which performs a structural function.The more private areas are showcased by an olive wood volume with a natural texture. This unit houses functions that are usually treated as secondary (bathrooms and technical areas) and serves as a visual counterpoint to the dominance of the sea in the common area.The bedrooms are fitted with simple materials and comfortable furniture to suit their domestic purpose. The Sao Felix Apartment offers an architectural experience based on spatial quality, material restraint and exquisite natural resources in harmonious dialogue with one another.
