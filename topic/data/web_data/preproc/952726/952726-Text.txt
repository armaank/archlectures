Text description provided by the architects. The project consists of a leisure area and an apartment connected to a house already located on a large plot of land on the banks of a lake, for a couple who are living between São Paulo and London.By combining new volumes and taking advantage of underused spaces of the property, which was built in the nineties, we created a spa next to the swimming pool, featuring a sauna, a hot tub, an indoor swimming pool, and a contemplation patio.The surroundings of the original pool were reorganized using concrete, wood, and glass, providing a private space for leisure by the garden.A full apartment, with a kitchen, fireplace, and bedroom, was installed in a vacant area. The space is divided by curtains, and a large skylight provides light and ventilation.Every environment allows you to enjoy privacy from the other rooms but still have contact with the gardens and the views of the surrounding nature.
