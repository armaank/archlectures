Text description provided by the architects. The project involves the design of an apartment that was bought as a shell and core. The client, a young banker living and working in Dubai, wanted to create a space that caters for house gatherings and seasonal vacations, but equally practical for the families future growth. The challenge was to create the dialogue between the living spaces without compromising privacy and separation, a main aspect of the Lebanese lifestyle.The client’s enthusiasm to house a multi-functional space to create intimacy in an open space that may contract and expand invited us to play with the idea of fragmented zones and a series of filters that slide open and disappear when required. Partitions had to be flexible, lighting had to be varied, materials had to be raw and bold, the ceiling had to indicate fragments without separating, and the ground had to be continuous and warm. At the entrance, a black steel booth was inserted. This object invites you to transition from the noise of the city into a moment of transcendence, recline, play a game, take a breath, hang your coat and then join the gathering.In the main space, large leather couches and a perforated wood closet created a display to peak into as you socialize. A fair faced concrete wall was used to highlight a transition between the various forms of gatherings. A perforated black steel library with a built in chimney created a two sided lounge zone. An intimate bed behind it for a moment to gaze at the printed back-lit false ceiling or a moment in front of the chimney with a good drink at an arm's length were integrated. A bench facing a beautiful balcony and view negotiated between the interior and exterior.  A marble wall, and a large perforated sliding door allowed us to transition into a TV room. Service spaces that include the kitchen and toilets used a similar palette of materials, colors, and play.
