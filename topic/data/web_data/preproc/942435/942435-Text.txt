Architecture and functionThe project is located on the outskirts of Quistello, Mantua and is part of the government's redevelopment plan after the earthquake. The project includes a youth activity center and a 2,000-square-meter park. Although the public building is mainly used by young people under the age of 18, it is flexible enough to be used by businesses, individuals, college students and young people for the vents and meetings. This is a single-storey building divided into two areas, namely service space and activity space.Outdoor squareThe external space of the building is partially surrounded by a carefully designed landscape. The paving is mainly located in front of the building, forming a small outdoor plaza that can be used to hold various public events and provide a new place for local people to relax.Glass wallThe building facade uses glass wall to keep the interior and outdoor park landscapes in close contact. The glass wall is shaded by the awning on the outside, and the amount of sunlight can be adjusted according to different periods and specific needs to ensure sufficient light in the room. Although the glass wall is very light, it still uses double glazing to ensure thermal insulation. The gate is also cushioned with a double-layer board, with insulation material inserted in between.Structure and energy savingThe structure is entirely made of reinforced concrete, which ensures a high thermal inertia and thus compensates for the portability of the facade. The entire project is based on the principle of environmental sustainability to reduce energy consumption and improve comfort inside and outside the building.
