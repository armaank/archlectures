Text description provided by the architects. Two light wooden elements organize the required program for a painter´s studio into a larger open space. Next to the façade, a glass wall finds its place among two different orientations of the space: on one hand, the perimeter created by the existing walls, and on the other hand, the tilted structure that follows a different orientation.The result is a zig-zag wall that generates two small places between the glass and the windows, offering a new “room” into the open space that also serves as a natural thermal regulator. On the other side, a light wooden structure is placed parallel to the opposite wall, generating a space that hosts the kitchen, the sink, the toilet, and the entrance.This wooden structure is used as well as a storage and as a support for paintbrushes, tests, papers and other items that are useful during work sessions.
