The ground and two groups of courtyards above ground are connected by open stairs, and the whole school becomes a huge multi-dimensional and multi-layered garden.The design uses the architectural space with an ancient Chinese view of nature and a sense of ritual to express the extensive and profound unity of nature and humanity and the order of space rites in Chinese culture. Express the inheritance of regional culture with abstract architectural symbols and features such as Huo er wall, arcade building and patio.Express the hundreds of years campus culture inside the story with the massive red brick and the stone material.
