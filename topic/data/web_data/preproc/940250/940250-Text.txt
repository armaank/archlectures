Text description provided by the architects. The project location is along the national highway in Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture. Our client for the project is IDOM inc., a company under “Gulliver” that operates used vehicle nationwide. With the request of efficiency, and a contactless service to support the Epidemic Control. The goal is to develop a new drive-way system using technology, art, and architecture.We want to break the traditional customer service style, where everything happens in an enclosed environment. While considering the driver’s view and car speed; the design must be highly visible and easy to access. Like a “Neighborhood Park”; a friendly, relaxing corner to both the client and the public.Every IDOM store has a large parking lot, so we thought it would be interesting to use part of the existing parking space. To create a vehicle assessment corner that can connect business with the neighborhood more naturally and applicable in other cities.The “Neighborhood Park” idea is designed with semi-transparent metal mesh; concave and convex squares to present the urban landscape. Bold signs and colors are applied to catch views from the drivers while engaging with the neighborhood.
