Text description provided by the architects. Nestled within the old estate of Singapore, this apartment is designed with a balance of nature and simplicity. Generously distilled into an open space plan, the design only retained one-bedroom, allowing the remaining space for the living quarters.A planter near the entrance brings life into the space, doubling as a privacy screen to shield the activities within. Timber louvres and big potted plants offset from the windows act as sunscreens, and concurrently create an opportunity for a green balcony. Anchored in the heart of the apartment is a customized furniture that integrates the lounging, dining, and working components seamlessly.Another highlight of Green House is the bespoke wooden portal that houses the kitchenette, with a concealed pivot door that leads to the back-of-house. Evidence of greens rooted within different pockets of the unit inspires the projectâ€™s name, while the use of a calm and neutral palette across attains a consistent and ordered spatial narrative.
