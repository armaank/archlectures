Text description provided by the architects. The project is about building a minimal house to make the most of the beautiful existing garden and the proximity of the sea; like a shelter to inhabit the site in a comfortable and dynamic way.The twenty square meters space gives the opportunity to find a dining room, a bow window as a living room with a sea view, a bathroom, a kitchen, sleeping for five people, toilets, and storage space.To bring a large pleasure in this small area, the challenge is to make the people feel inhabiting the garden. Thus we use several devices: sliding windows which disappear behind the walls make the garden passing through the house; a bow window frames the sea and the village church and immerses the inhabitant in the landscape; a generous clerestory roof overhang gives shelter to the immediate surroundings; a terrace offers views to the surrounding.
