Text description provided by the architects. FIRMEZA is the refurbishment of a downtown apartment in Porto. Its previous display was fragmented and confusing, lacking coherence and hierarchy.The intervention sets a clear night/day layout - on one side the bedrooms, on the other a group of contiguous living areas. In the middle, a curved curtain wall characterizes the space, defining it with a scenic and ludic gesture. At the end of this axis, a mirror plays with the spatial perception.It is an exercise in clarity and lightness.
