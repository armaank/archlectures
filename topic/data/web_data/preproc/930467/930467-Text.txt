Dasic Fernández, artist in charge, with a team of 14 people, one engineer, 2 architects, 11 artist, and 20 local assistants made this project in 30 days.Dasic was inspired by several topics for the work, “I am looking to respect the tradition of geometric patterns typical of the area, bringing them to the present and mixing them with my personal work. The colors are the result of my palette added with the pastel tones of the area, which removes a little saturation of the colors I use regularly ... just a little. As for the drawing, I emphasized the transitions from one pattern to another, this because I wanted to leave a visual record in the work of the integration of the past and the present and also of the social and cultural transition that Saudi Arabia is going through right now ”
