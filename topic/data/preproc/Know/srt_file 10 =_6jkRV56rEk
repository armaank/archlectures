Good evening, my name is Rachel Garshick Kleit, the section head for city and'
regional planning here
at the Knowlton School of Architecture
and it's my pleasure to welcome you tonight to your
to the weekly Baumer lecture, and it's my pleasure also to introduce"
Dr. Tridib Banerjee to you.
I have to say, I've read Dr. Banerjee's work for many years and I've heard
his name for a long time and so I'm delighted to have been able to meet him"
during his visit.
His thinking about urban spaces and planning
is brought in from my perspective, all encompassing.
He focuses on design and the planning of the built environment'
and the related human and social consequences and some of the titles of'
his recent
work illustrate this interest of the intersection in the built environment'
and social consequences. One of them is called "Suspicion, Surveillance and Safety:
a New Imperative for Public Spaces," and it\'s in a book which'
I love the title of, "Planning as if People Mattered:'
Looking Back for the Future." Another title is "Conceptualizing the Child'
Friendly Neighborhood: A Question of Form, Family and Functioning."'
So I said he was broad, from crime to children'
in the built environment. Perhaps
in his work in planning theory, he has wrestled with other kinds of topics like'
citizen involvement in planning processes as well as'
attempting to reconcile the differences across'
the profession, practice and
academy in planning as a field. Perhaps his most cited work
is his 2001 Journal of the American Planning Association article'
which is entitled "The Future of Public Space Beyond Invented Streets'
and Reinvented Places," which outlines the impacts the privatization globalization'
and the communications revolution on our social values,'
and how the public perceives what it wants,'
in how it ask for public spaces,
and also on the supply of those public spaces and that's
a theme
that he\'ll come back to this evening. His publications also include "Beyond the'
Neighborhood Unit"
with Liam Bear, "City in Sense, City in Design,"
writings and projects of Kevin Lynch, which have co-edited with Michael'
Southworth.
And "Urban Design Downtown: Poetics and Politics
of Form," with Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris,
and currently has a four-volume edited
series coming out called "Critical Urban Studies: Urban Design" so you should look for'
that in the future,
or very near future. He has been the Associate Dean of the former'
USC School of Urban and Regional Planning, and also the Vice Dean of the'
USC School of Public Policy,
and now this is the sole Price School, where he still is. Professor Banerjee is'
a fellow
at the American Institute of Certified Planners, a member of the Planning'
Accreditation Board,
and is actively involved with the Association of Collegiate Schools'
of Planning.
so it's my pleasure to have Dr. Banerjee talk to us tonight about public"
space,
urban commons and urban design, thank you.
Thank you very much,
Rachel, for this wonderful introduction. This
is a real pleasure and honor to be here,
Ohio State University today, a
football competition of my university from time to time, but'
not this year. I guess I should have
used gray in
deference to Ohio State, I probably should have had a red background.
But I don't think the letters would have shown up that well.
So I'm going to talk about
public space and urban commons and urban design,'
some of this
the trials I will present actually come out of my earlier work,'
which Rachel mentioned, but also some will be work that I've been doing now,"
and it has been somewhat
of a consul interests for this
this concept a public space, so
 
there is an old medieval saying
"staftluft macht frei."
I'm no German speaker, but those of you who
know German probably would know that that means'
that "city air makes one free," this is an old medieval concept that'
when the Serbs came to the medieval city, they became free. The city air,'
when you talk about city air, it's not the,
you know, the air you breathe at home, but it's the air you breathe in the
public
that makes the concept of the public realm
an important part of becoming free.
And so,
this concept is rarely associated with the freedom of expression,'
freedom of speech, and freedom of
access, unused,
In fact, in times of political upheaval, as we are currently seeing now,
in the Arab streets, squares,
that the public realm plays a critical role in shaping the'
insurgency in movement for liberation
from the autocratic rule. The news and events in Istanbul's"
Taksim Square, for example, as you know, so that the opposition, the'
government plans to build a shopping mall, of all things,'
in the middle of the prettiest
public space was not
really an acceptable use of an
icon for a larger sort of
autocratic rule, and a protest against against that rule.'
So in all these
instances, you can see the public space has become that kind of'
important to the concept of their freedom and political freedom and'
democracy and so forth.
So what I would like to begin by the
roughly to talk a little about the idea of public space and some of the arguments about'
public space.
Kind of what I call a critical narrative of loss,
that has been around in the literature about how'
we're losing our public realm or public space,"
and that I wanted to use the idea the urban Commons'
and talk about some other interesting ideas that have been presented in the'
urban commons,
and the question is whether public space falls in the part of urban'
commons, and then I have some concerns,
privacy concerns, about the future of the public space'
in the urban common recovery house, concerns that I have already
expressed in this article
and since ultimately architects and urban designers, planner
so the next question is what are some of the challenges for urban design'
in a general way.
So the essential argument, if you look at the major intellectual tradition,'
you know in the social theory, they have
emphasized that the public spaces used
for social purposes
for possibility of conviviality,
social contact, the important part of maintaining a good'
society. In political theory, it has been associated with what I said earlier,'
democracy freedom, freedom of expression,
even first amendment rights in the contract of the United State.'
The feminist theorists have looked at public space'
and they have been little bit critical about the other'
sort of exuberance with the political theory about public realm and
democracy,
so they have some, a little it of
another view to that but
that has been covered a little bit in issue one, and then there's a liberal
economic theory,
who are also, have talked about public good,'
public space to the public good, but maybe it should not be,'
have to be, about the public good, and there are some'
interesting implications for that.
So in social theory,
like these slides, shows,
you know, the essence of the social contact that'
the social tourist talked about, the
left side of Millennium Park in Chicago,
the right hand side, the Union Square in New York, Manhattan.'
In the former case, the public art is become a setting for kids and
the parents alike and meet total strangers,
there's a high potential for social contact in these instances."
The Union Square is enormously a popular
spot to hang out, especially for the younger generation,'
this is also multi-cultural, multi-ethnic group'
and the multi-culturalism, the nature of what we were doing, society in America,'
is also an important part in the social theory mix,
that how the use of the break and the cultural agency, where does that happen,
and one argument has been made that nowhere else than public space,
that's why you need, you know, the strangest people from other cultures and"
other places.
Conviviality, Lisa PD talks about
convivial cities that we should b
aspiring to create, convivial cities with convivial spaces,
Here in two pictures, on the right, inside a Plumber's park in West Hollywood,"
and in the left corner is the
a little slice of a shot from
Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia.
So these are the places where people go to you know, play'
chess, just to hang out or meet with the friends
and that kind of environment where you feel comfortable, free and'
you were willing to talk to complete strangers from time to time,'
and that's the kind of spirit the public space"
sort of produces.
The public space of course doesn't have to be an outdoor park,"
public space can be here, in this instance, for example, Grand Central,'
one could think about public space like Grand Central, the place of'
public life, where typically you might
go to hang out, they have restaurants around there and they're not"
just to catch a train. In fact, Grand Central Station for New
York is the place where
you'll be coming from a common place where you want to meet
your friend, just, you know, wait for me by the clock,'
on the right hand side of
the Grand Central concourse, or something like that, so'
so this is also a kind of an example of the public space
that is the important role in daily life. The job,
there's a notion of third places that Ray Oldenburg
wrote a wonderful book called "The Great Good Places"
in which, talked about third places. What're third places? Well
the first places are the place of where he lives, second place is that place he goes to work or'
go to school
and third place is a place where you hang out, and your quality of life
the city really depends on your access to third places, and how much time you'
spend in
other places, and again he talks about third places'
as if they're all private places like cafes, coffee shops,
bookstores, bars, hair salons,
and other hang outs in the heart of a community. That's the title of his"
book, but it doesn't have to be,
there are some public hang out places too, so on the left hand
side you see the tier of the the National Building Museum in Washington DC,'
we did the wonderful architectural space,
and it's a very, very popular public space, mothers come with the strollers"
and the kids,
you know the kindergarten class comes there with the teacher,'
out to spend the morning and afternoon. On the right hand side,'
you know in Berlin, their building, they start rebuilding Stadtschlosse,
the old city
castle that was torn down, or bombed
during the World War II, replaced by the
European, the East German Communist
regime, but now that that Bad Billy has been taken out,'
and they're now rebuilding that old Stadtschloss, only
in the outside, wouldn't you know it will be
I don't know, maybe a shopping mall, or something like that, but the the typical"
German tradition, they have set up an infobox,
where you can go see the exhibits and stuff like that,'
and this, the right hand pictures show, an example of part of this,
inside the infobox works, perfect strangers, a mother with two kids, on this'
older gentleman,
they have discovered your phone and they're listening to the"
stories that are telling about Stadtschloss, what they're
planning for it. This other kind of a place
that I think we need more of
in cities. From the political point of view, of course, the citizenship'
is an important part of, expression, our public space symbolizes
the right to citizenship, in this case
in Los Angeles, some years ago when
the Congress was thinking about the tight
immigration law they wrote, this was spontaneous outpouring
of streets of Los Angeles of these
a these people without paper, basically
who are about to be denied citizenship, but they're all pushing their babies who"
are born in the
United States, and already by birthright,
claimed citizenship.
So, James Holston,
from Berkeley has talked about
this insurgent citizenship, the expressions of citizenship rights,'
where else can express, other than being
in the public space. Then,
you know the recently hundred square, this democratic movement the Arab Street,'
the right handside, on the left handside, and also Italian street,'
picture Naples having some labor union protests that were'
wages, but the square is important, interestingly with
nothing but the big traffic roundabout, all of a sudden
became, but because it was a central location, it became the place that'
the whole democracy movement
in Egypt began.
 
In her book "A Brave New Neighborhood," Margaret Kohn'
makes a compelling argument that, when it comes down to it,'
in the US at least, the first amendment rights'
are the ones that make the public space
so essential to democracy. Both
her and the Benjamin Barber political theories,'
also has argued how important public spaces are'
for the survival of democracy.
What is interesting about this writing, is that they're not architects,
they're not planners, they're not urban designers,"
they're social scientists, social theorists
political theorists, that of qualities that historians,'
they're arguing, making a case for public space."
 
The feminist theory, picking up on that, they say oh yeah sure public space, an'
important one, but they have to sell a place in the continuum between the'
public space and the domestic space,
but also, they are a little bit skeptical about
the mourning goes on among
the public realm, supporters
that they would have been a decline in public spaces'
so forth, so they argue and they talk about the old Greek
agoras, in the Greek democracy which took place in agoras'
for public space, so they kind of break separately, the people like
Nancy Fraser and Margaret
Crawford,
and they point out the lesson, guys,
don't get too carried away, but think about the Greek city-state,"
the folks who met in the world would decide the affairs of the state are all'
male greeks with wearing
togas and all that, but women were not allowed there, women were'
home, nor would the slaves, so the Greek'
democracies, they had a romanticized idealized form.
So women were not allowed
in the public space, and
in the right hand picture, the, some of the
Middle Eastern feminist writers have picked up on that, and said'
that's right, in this, or what you see in the Islamic cities,
is that where the public space is really the'
space for man, home is a space for women,
and if you're in public space you are in the intruder."
So a woman in a public space, you're the intruder
intruding the public space, and so wearing a veil, covering yourself up,'
is an attempt to be invisible,
so to speak, symbolically, and here is a picture of the'
 
square in front of the old mosque, what are obvious behind, you see some'
woman completely clothed, and then on the left handside, this'
New Yorker
cover, which was titled Mother's Day
and what it shows, is all the fathers, except for one mother'
kind of walking into this play area, except
all the folks were there with the kids were all fathers.'
Now, many mothers, the mothers are having a day out, so the father is sitting'
the kid, but there may be a subtle
a subtext to the spoof, that might be saying that the fathers are out of work'
now,
staying home taking care of the kids, mothers are the productive'
members of the family, out in the job market'
earning the bread.
I wish I had shown you, but some of you may know about this famous painting,
I think it hangs in the Chicago Art Institute, by'
and the Enrique Cape, the stop cable,
which shows a picture of
a french gentry walking the streets of Paris
immediately after
Haussmann's renovation of Paris
and what is interesting about the picture is that
every woman shown in the picture were accompanied by
gentleman. This is a late 19th century picture. Even in the late 19th century in Europe,
women were not supposed to be out in the public on their own'
unless they were escorted by their
husband, father, brother, son.
The only woman who are out there, on their own, were the'
ladies of the street.
So even in Europe in the West,
the public space was very much limited to'
access with women and so
but in the working after the invent of the capitalism,
consumerism,
you need women to sell materials, self commodities,'
so they had to devise the spacing on the right-hand side,'
a wonderful invention in Paris,
as well as other parts of Europe, these passages are the gallerias'
which are created with the shops
lined there and then this is where the women are brought to
do their shopping, and although this is kind of more of an acceptable way of being in the
the public, this was really sort of
a precursor to the department store, when you think of the department store,
how the departments have came about, is mainly because to bring women
to do their shopping, and so the women were'
eventually went to department stores on their own to do their shopping, but not'
even in the late 19th century, they were not, but these passages,'
are still very much part of Paris, if you know, they're"
wonderfully restored, so this is Passage Choiseul,
in Paris, the way it was in the late 19th century,
and how it is today.
The political theorists talk about public sphere
public realm and
I think the sign on the left, this in Buenos Aires,
Estamos Mejorando, Espacio Publico, de todos, para todos,
we're
improving the public space
of all, for all, is almost of the linkness thing (?),
by all, would've been good, but didn't do that.
But this, I think, seeing this sign is actually pretty much self said,
Buenos Aires has a progressive
city government and they're emphasizing in the public space, the public realm
not just for the wealthy and the upperclass, but for everybody.
The bus, Espacio Publico, I think also is a wonderful
reminder that public space doesn't have to be stationary.
A bus is a public space also
and the public space of the transit is a former public space,
although it might be moving. Then there is a'
thing about the public space as a public good, it's the economic theory"
which is that certain kind of goods are not
produced by the market, and these are the kind of goods where you cannot exclude'
anybody,
so that non-excludable and non-rival, the consumption of that good,'
not a shortage,
deny somebody else from access to the goods, and'
so the public space was considered a sort of like a public good'
is very much like the air you breathe, you know,
my breathing of air does not affect somebody else's breathing of air,
although if you're in Los Angeles,
you may think twice about that because there are'
areas of Los Angeles that are highly segregated,
by small quality, and
to the folks who live in the interior of Los Angeles be the significantly
inferior than the folks on the coast,
but recently the economy is certainly challenging this argument. They said
well and we're not sure that this is a
public space is a public good, they think that the public space can be'
provided
by also the private sector this
next picture here, is an example of a
seemingly a park, a public space, but this is part of a development in San Jose'
California.
This is part of a complex of housing and shopping'
and in the middle, they have this kind of nice,
you know, bandstand, the music is playing and all that.
So the economy shifts so well, here we go, this is a
public space, produced by private sectors,
so why just like a private good, so why do we have to
worry about not having enough done by
by the city.
But the question isn't the what's wrong with this picture, you
wonder, the problem with this
kind of public space is that they're really not public space,"
they're not publicly owned, they're privately owned,
and your presence there is only a privilege,
not the right, like being in a real city park,
therefore, there are a lot of things you cannot do,
and they can exclude you, they can ask you to leave if you are not'
wearing your hair right or you feel not wearing the right
kind of clothes, if you're wearing droopy
shorts with your underwear showing, or who knows what
what they might ask you to leave because they think you don't belong there."
I'd like to tell you that I, myself, have been kicked out of
the American, the Great Americana, the big shopping mall in Bloomington,'
Minneapolis, and all I was doing was taking pictures
and then finally they came up to me two young'
folks like you guys and said
you know can we to talk to you, this is a long story but
eventually they wanted my ID, I said that I don't think I have to"
give you my ID, and they said finally so we'll call the police,
right, so anyway I left, and in fact it turns out that the police of
Bloomington, Indiana was protecting my
civil rights and he sort of chewed out this guy and said
just go, don't worry about it.
So there are those constraints,
they can ask you to leave, you don't have to worry about taking
pictures in a public space.
So I've been kicked out a couple of times but this was the most
intense of it. So, there is a sort of a kind of a
that there are three kind of narratives of loss of our public space,
one is that what's happening is that increasingly public spaces are becoming"
privatized, and
the public realm is therefore shrinking,
right, a furthermore loss of these spaces are places
where people like to hang out, meet, sort of
friendly places, they feel comfortable
are being kind of eliminated as part of
the new global economy with the wonderful expression that
the two political scientists
Kantor and Savitch talk
about global broom and local sweep, so basically what'
they say, the imperatives of global economy is making the local'
government actually cleaning out a lot of these older neighborhoods and places
is to provide wonderful urbanism and public space,
and the third thing might be a kind of a possible agoraphobia,
that with coming from the, you know, ICP in cyberspace,
increasing, you are spending more time at home, on the computer,'
we can order stuff from
my computer,
we can do just about everything from the computer, who needs
to go out and you have yourself a fear of others,'
of unfamiliar, in the public space,
so this agoraphobia, which means the fear of being out in the open,
might become a kind of reality for most Americans,'
as we get more and more
built, you know, sucked into this sorta of the
the cyberspace in several communities and
all of that.
So the next question that I want to sort of follow briefly is that, so what
is the idea of the urban commons on these urban space
and commons,
the legal scholars have argued that it is, although there are some questions,
social scientists have argued that the urban commons are for me to find unique
public culture of the city, but the problem with the notion of the commons is that,
you know, the Commons has all of the problems of
being over grazed, the tragedy of the commons, for this is
Garnett Harden's notion that if you
have a commonly owned property,
owned by sheep
ranchers, they could bring as many
cattle or sheep in the common space and the maximize'
their number of sheep because it's a free good,
but if everybody does that, basically the commons disappear.'
this is value and and yet the
the prod the other worthy tell you that the fallacy that that will be kinda with'
a rational behavior we have that situation'
it is rational who have your as many a
are their great a possible
you may think that them silly
but think about if you go out in a restaurant with a bunch of folks'
you decide that will be sharing the cost
the bill equally would you be ordering the cheapest item in the'
the when you are the was open to buy them'
think about you're probably go for the most expensive I don't because"
this is being sold socialized over right
so that so this is the congress argue that that's"
thats for the rational his now the
so the the Russell man cannot cooperate this theory'
argues but this has been challenged by other economies'
like I want to Sen in a wonderful article call'
national rules so they rationalize man must be a social'
our show the
a to the question how do you can manage to discover their own comments'
one choice is becoming get privatized Woodley'
other choices yet the with government
to so running it
the new liberal cases for the privatization based on the property'
rights
but somewhat regular all strong
instance economy she has argued the self governance model'
use this line could work too
so these p.m. %uh three new yorker
cover actually shows spoof on the
on the government to the left to the the government then this is new yorkers'
a.m. Nov it will they get
mirror Bloomberg is
so where the progressive active
policies lies in New York
so you know this is the government going to open up the middle of the city to'
bring the
the comments the old Buffalo Common back in the game buffalo's control in the"
middle of Manhattan
or you know you can have the public punishment for eating too much'
smoking are salt or or
carb or in these way up
think he wrote this the the problematic tourist'
to put them in a lil tourist pass and
that they can only stay in the tourist will decide what we gonna'
kinda divided partition the spaces so these are the things the government'
could do Total
that age their incomes so the of obviously'
in everybody field that's not the like
thing now I wanted so the example of while'
briefly that that we have in our human history there example self'
of urban Commons and the one of the good example about'
the Medina's of Morocco in particularly first but then our"
a with some pizza or and as you can see the picture to the right'
this is the cuddling district in
Morocco fares and basically
these are all on
they're all who sorry
ozone
so so this is the los kiero these old
ads and if you look at the you know the
either also be courtyard houses
but little a bill XP each other the question how did he get the city for'
how did they manage to build it without any zoning code and'
and billing a setback requirements and things like that'
well me this is can exactly the case of a'
self-organizing community the only thing that guided'
this process the bill the islamic i det
drive for Sharia law and some other kind self'
ethical principles by Walker which meant donating land for'
public use and so for so this this
up
this community still survives and this is very much to the medical community'
and if also broken up by Hills and so
the the institutional guild actually
manages the city so I love the this basis'
narrow spaces that disappear under the buildings'
so for all those kept clean and
supervised by folks who live there this so'
he the the pic next picture for example shows'
different with the house on the about and it shows how these'
interior circulation spaces clean and well-maintained'
and all that flow seamlessly between the private space'
boss and the public spaces and things like that'
so I'll know this assumption about the public goods what are the different with"
the public good in
public Commons the public good is a it's an honest ruble"
on rival the comments ideas days non excludable'
what's a practical his exit yes consumption up some of the Commons"
means that you're taking them away from the total Commons"
I'll so the non rival assumption to the public"
good how r are under scrutiny in our they said'
the said most market goods can be up with Publix'
that's going to market goods I wanted to shape quickly"
this how that happen so this is a his webster'
professor planning and it was a hong kong original Cardiff'
he argued in this picture that this is what happens so when you have economic'
just in case if you think the for example'
the guy with the PSSI Marco which is a non-exclusive all'
and non rival I mean you're enjoying
yes a son Marco affect anybody else
but what happened to be at the comarca get very cool'
just what happened that just like when I want this'
ball and wanted to see the Sophia
long line well but
turned out that if I paid or
this in a lot of money I could have my own 20'
or a different group who so by paying
so basically then I'm during his own of
non a still not excludable theoretically
by I'm now entering his own rival
the way but then eventually that might lead'
to what he called be which is that on rival'
and excludable case which is very much like'
the cities in southern California and maybe in any metropolitan area'
you how a yeah
basically by creating
if you are a member of the community you
you are you are not he
if you're not a member of the community you cannot so their parts than"
than playgrounds and things like that but they're only"
reserved for folks who live in that community safe you don't belong to the"
community
you don't belong there so there that cannot compromise then finally"
you there I politics little witches what has become completely privatized'
and he think that this is this this is inevitable inevitable in the context of'
up overcrowding yes so for the only way I can maintain'
significant among the public space will be through privatization'
this is something that I want to sort of challenge'
with next life Sony the concerned about the future published May'
are in common so what they say is that enclosure up the common that these'
comments should be divided people given some rights'
use that Commons I'll a second form of
loss 0 comments might be encroachment on the Commons'
than most other forms overgrazing look at'
I and then there's the possibility about the Asian up the Commons"
the surveillance of the consulate this
so one one outcome of this and close up the Commons is this picture'
Sao Paulo Brazil you have seen this
this is not before the shop by the way deal'
it real real picture so what you see here'
the for their eyes a on the
the left inside here and in the propellers'
was basically that they got the puck created'
is gated community to this gaping be
from the community gated community became very popular these days'
with their own tennis court swimming pool on the public amenities'
so they don't need to go to the public space part have their own part"
inside the gated community to this is an example of the enclosure'
the comp and so what happens then there are the procedural'
spaces that the left what does folks who cannot'
don't have the Acer money belong to that got a gated community"
but the gated communities and now become
very very popular all over the world the
third-world sorry yes
the third were a
economy the prospering you see now
number of these gonna develop Beijing
a gated community this is
a sign for similar kinds develop
calcutta in India about
the done by the p.m. developer for Singapore'
I'll this picture if you see someone the
phenomenon of encroachment on the Commons'
this thing the one on the left inside this is gonna be interesting story from'
economies
so the stories that didn't put you there the one street"
that had a direct view on fuji
but now they're going to build their big
power here basically blocking
the 1 would you know you up the month food you want to argue'
as part of the kind of the urban Commons and so essentially'
what's happening here that other people's right to develop"
now taking away exhausting Europe uncommon the view'
in a is interesting in San Francisco
were designed planned economy address that and one other things about'
somebody's government designer
the sketches with here that they
the this said all the high rise building should be in the top of the hill'
not at the bottom Hill because that's the only"
way can protect the view shed
the folks Hills so the sure there are some interesting a redesign'
implication about if you think about the view which is a very important'
consideration was special the west coast
that's part of the urban Commons that you don't want to lose"
he and then we have this government growth would of course which'
way was Hollywood sidewalk cafe
he's not a problem world who knows
would not because this adding to the public life'
urbanism so there are certain government crossword we obviously allow'
live with because it adds to the
urban urbanism life
a the squatters a you know
they arm through the K-seven overgrazing
the flow that the
to hard calls the Tragedy of the Commons
the column controlled were great well they're not really over great"
up really any other option there you know them'
you mean space and the
in the Sacramento case they have these the homeless folks'
the freeway or
ice are structure
is also they're not probably
as change that this like gays
wide are these cases the Lord grazing is additionally then'
right to get to know these things that they're this"
now the p you know one afternoon in some parts good walking why'
Union Square hear these a test text of a piercing'
soprano voice saying so that the
year piercing for the all the didn't bus OVA"
sandwiches for downtown and then I see here there'
she is the way the Maiden Lane
the view I could picture
this bill is one of the real Frank Lloyd Wright'
jewelry store line I'll to this feed is actually blocked off"
traffic and the palace faith
but he encroaching on public comments
and whatever right inside here in san Telmo this figure was Rs'
very nice music on
joining well that's kind of an encroachment love the comment I guess"
but but that's the kind of thing you probably don't worry about"
or for example in Little Italy
in or
York where fun genero day festival
all Street has been taken well
ferris wheel the kind shopping stalls in
would stall week this space is completely'
occupied but with that sparkle
urbanism the public culture the city
I'm we have this kind 7 gotcha moments like these"
ladies in downtown Los Angeles
garment district you is a Los Angeles
silly still doesn't know how do reacted is because"
technically way all codes logged in Los Angeles'
that encroachment should mood but increasingly'
in the from the garment district area in the in the'
Broadway they are people are
be exhibiting their wheres
out on the street as custom is
from the culture that come from and so they're kinda looking the other way"
are not yet win to
movies I V I this picture from
Sokolow in City very calm
way the encroaching on the com I'll
yes by you know mexico's
are quickly or i'd they're probably like them to be"
but then you see in the streets of neighborhood street about'
hello you know is gonna win
where you parked your the car the side
free out or you have a kind of this kind of a local'
produce market was
temporary but this happens every day
serve the community so that's probably
okay to those adamant but then we pick up to'
up for the same they were good they have this guy'
set up shop on the ire
so you have your laundry what your wife at ho'
and get the ironing done by this guy the
corner yes set up this little showed
right like the sidewalk
nobody knows way that
like in fact that helps the folks who live there'
this is a heard the classic case so the
grazing or Holland to the riverbank
up someone what the dealer India
in Ahmedabad and so the city has
decided that will very definitively
to get rid of this whoa have a new
development plan and so
so these guys are all gone water
this is a common slut the river back
it's a water columns
so artworks what's happening there of course"
the new plan for use the word call
would nice
shopping spree wall
should United water
Marshall problem place
it is probably job partly
in close because these are party privately'
own is stalls
I'll but the other word possibility
is not the obligation of the commons and I don't the warlike operations"
the I just made it up what all it means that from'
come forward obviate meaning I'm not making it unnecessary"
show so this is the worry is that ultimately'
with the public spaces not going to be relevant'
because if you can do everything
at home with your he laptop and computer
what this this picture the interesting
this is from yet you already
Wallonia de Polonia the one on the European'
sorry that you wonder why fly quite early'
and so what you see these kids that will only the big University'
all this university or hid their
here they are right next the old building'
this in this world sweet spot for the wifi'
and Hero 3 film
what the cultural regan population
meeting there with their
worldwide not so
its so it just says that even with
the laptop you rather be allowed to the public in a public space'
28 the this so they're not yet struck by
agoraphobia was referring to earlier
and this was what he saw and was Rs PR la guardia'
less is that apartment
artist I they have a facebook
you fight for the part and we go to that site'
you find all kinds of notices
things like the tree should be
there's a trim the trees are there a lot so empty beer cans"
with up or you know those companies 0 complains'
what also you might find some notes about'
personal thing stories about you know the cat leather'
are you know that fell just like
the kind of social events that will happen in the neighborhood level'
and the when this artist cell the
other for example of how so this example or I think'
the said the way that with the beginning to find out through social media'
and the Internet might be able to connect to our public space'
at the in fact created new appreciation a public space in'
created with the public life show this one'
other up the Plaza
was he is word the long
and this is another example where
actually Diane number in your cell phone
listen to the story about that particular space in the history of the'
place
so so these are I think I it's not
although he be worried about mission the Commons'
but that may not that for the case but will have to'
work on it a the other thing where you is that this a rail'
that increasingly I'll this article that
in Rachel mention we did that some years ago'
before Snowden's revelations place
and now you know where under surveillance'
heavily why our own government
and so the weatherman Commons has been under surveillance for quite some time'
yeah it could be either a man surveillance portions'
wired Los Angeles are welcome Museum of Contemporary Art'
where you have the the video camera
City of London is full of cameras
both circuit cameras all over the place
and don't brief don't seem to want to I'd"
what they're constantly watching this is the kind of weapon uptick"
gays digital were
thats constantly watching you and
so make you one gentleman said that
you know he is it a violation of my fourth amendment right'
I don't know anyone no their going within"
a marriage counselor or a for to the clinic or'
why shrink a I don't want to be
seen are are recorded that they did that
so my giving up that a
the violation of the Fourth Amendment right to the search-and-seizure'
well the legal this open court I said your 4th Amendment rights'
and when you leave your whole but they are arguing that no'
we carry our fourth amendment right if so because if you don't do that"
you don't have the right to what would happen in increasingly people going"
to cover so this hooting
wide kids units it's where with a jacket
is a way of governing this is you know these'
famous live in what cases with example
and the governing might have another way love it'
harris also rollers or who put on the Wii eggs'
big sunglasses to
that will be the kind of real response coming up'
I'll so a you know the
the city the berlin the tell you all know that you are'
undersell station some ways but OMG
inside the platform its heartbeat
no the camera are build
dot that are watching you
everywhere um him so
up so is that something to worry about
a some people who are you turning this
so what one feel safe ring
safety 11 public
others are they said this gentleman's argument"
it's actually a low 2002
law review about if not that clear
because once you begin to give up his rights then'
white back to on you
so the Inc conclusion moving towards the pollution'
thing up so challenges for a redesign
so what what are the challenges for design'
given this display of
possibility is that a that are happening
so one is that a I think that there were designers should'
maintain their advocacy urban Commons
we should think about urban common for the protagonist in urban design'
this is the term used by professor
you want to go Brazil from Sao Paulo
they're doing a study with saying we
we think about the the the space left between'
buildings Street and other things in the space'
that we should be warning about this is this is'
so this is our protagonist in the design
show one would think a weatherman common to the protagonist'
line then there is this the notion of designing the Aristotelian city is'
opposed to the
atomic city this last work that Rachel
when should look for one in peace this unedited'
be there when I after I did action summarizing'
the setup the history or design
in in developing or
question and it seems that it has taken
who tracks one is the political the Platonic'
track I'll very stick vigorous
definitive kinda landfill brasilia
gurus Chandigarh the example of the black onyx'
City the other side that is totally in city'
which is the design studio negotiation why'
discussion which is and that the provisional'
participatory in the platonic City
the Philly designed by here or here architects'
who houses Norman Foster's and Frank Gehry's"
ruche they're the ones the design this
City in the Aristotelian City the city we'
see every day the designers are not open 0'
faceless they are the anti-heroes
and yet it is that though that the heroes'
they are the ones who are in charge of the the protagonist'
their own comments the one they're have to design the"
Herman fine or D what the
as powerful
so in the advocates for their work Commons a several things one is the'
protection preservation
restoration of colin White and resources on one other thing for'
talked about but in a international context this city that growing'
becoming overpopulated
cities leave China
India it's amazing and their
so they're the consular gesture overcrowding"
yet serious one that the economy's talking about"
in India for example with the thing is that'
something like fifty percent of all our residents in Indian cities'
don't have access to there are more
people in India who a real India who have'
access to cellphones but not gone
so why do people do where do they go while they use BR /1 comment'
which is the riverbank the railroad tracks'
and that's where the in the way
the worse for what you want dignity particularly women'
who cannot go their life
to the women go when the denied
Sandra shows so this is a new reality
I'll the BR /1 comment you know you can and closer one colony"
protector powers but what about the rest but defender'
'em and so opening up in seven clothing or one comment that they would be a good"
thing too
so advocate for and using the parlance the billing the human capability in'
dignity should be on the cover major
goal that is achieved so maybe Shipra white public toilets'
wherever and however as many can
City India um
the other possibility is like
you know this is the sort of the governing the urban comedy'
to from from New York City the Deacon
he close-up streets and up you know the kids play'
this guy Wonderwall Oregon about school hoops and things like that on summer day'
the city state's can redesign the complexities been designed to include"
some features
this mental activities in Beijing they have now they provide this'
a a mechanical walkers on the sidewalk sale'
while you're waiting for bus you're getting exercise"
so worry about the city that
maybe the public space the public Street space care providers'
that so I'm the new york city has done terrific"
terrific thing rumor so the
much a broadway has been now replying
you space
does the parts are pretty
band their bicycle paths
and their this dead space is taken out by the'
I'll use for sitting in all that
High Line Park in New York other very good example of'
recovering old abandoned
elevator render track and converted
part a so these are all the new possibilities'
other think about it designing this gonna'
is partly in City devoted to the
design your Commons so the designing for their starting in city'
he designed for pluralism the board one
multicultural society diversity and multi-culturalism'
to pay attention to I'll justice and equity"
in axis2 the Commons
I Michael Walzer talks about their two types of'
spaces single-minded spaces and open minded spaces'
single-minded spaces that this place is a 941 particular function'
open-minded faces the spaces spaces
that accommodate many different kinds of functions'
so we should be defining open-minded spaces'
then they are uncommon can accommodate more activities'
and youth the congestion affect so it's a basketball court when the afternoon"
kids
should basketball I in the evening
the elderly folks can come into that they cheer exercise'
same court in the same so no more fun
different behavior setting should be thinking about those guys'
and up to my environmental Press lot
me with talks about but chill disable were talking about how to make'
and community lot of it depends on the design'
Commons I maximum choices for you
functioning capability and create greater control for users that Kevin'
Lynch
all advocated 200 last line
a is that the in a way
one could probably come up with day little bit nerdy whale'
were thinking about
classifying common
the close columns in postpone
ok common barry why
the principal arch by and
different levels the patrols obviously worth it'
function are
the different kinds upon they play some overlapping'
this can be vice reply talked about
so I just finish their review the part
about the going forward whether he could do'
things I think I'm
its short over five minutes or
okay thank you
out
0
but
up are
up
for you know I think something you see you I think maybe the Bloomberg an'
earlier era
Mayor Daley Chicago and Mehran than you know'
also I are Los Angeles they have all kind of'
dedicated I'm so what a
they're all strong mayor I mean here we go see the week mayor"
basically the other two cases but nor even really have a lot of power'
the City Council does but they
took the initiative to do the transit improvement is a Los Angeles'
was the very Gaza effort
and he he needed some some fantastic things actually'
very very innovative policies but but so so the'
show in each of these three instances the'
obviously the mayor's them played a very critical role"
the Millennium Park in chicagoans other improvements'
and bakery way the recovering cost
chrome public infrastructure Chicago
a person rumor good amazing
from Benny called ones
sorrow hopes a glasses
to do
his the grumman these threesome
or really remarkable so so
you're right I don't think the planners themselves can do that without some"
good I'll leadership
or or support very people at the top
but I think the at least in the big cities there is a growing awareness that'
in the people are becoming the merits and all that I mean you know we in our'
this America revenue Mary Los Angeles and the mayoral debate the'
this question about president developing the question about you'
the club the other bike path the question about public space'
his are very much part of the debate
along with the No
you the Union wages and stuff like that but the fact that those countries'
issue that now the or yeah I think you're very"
encouraging signs I I would hope that the the'
planner sylvie designers will be
in a good good shape to
pursue their goals they'll have to settle"
you know brave enough gone talk with the mayor'
they're always looking for ideas but typically"
winners then deal with timid
because the beaten up by the City Council'
so often like to stick their neck out
at the other people be disorder
supported mission of
of
or
here
here
yeah I'm not sure I'll you you know what what we need to do"
we've will mich white with that wonderful study of social use a small"
public space
had done a study of side work in that way because they're waking hour with"
them
wonderful principles ok design a plaza
although he did the ditsy year study some the side good behavior'
but I think you know I think again a new york city'
I'm a great fan of New York City the side of some new york city a very wide"
the happens basically and a lot of things have happened'
without call what happened in los angeles's extreme"
we have basically taken out sidewalk
space so too had that one more lie
for for car traffic so we have sidewalks in Los Angeles barely 45'
why I believe in the utility pole and all the other'
miscellaneous stuff to go on the sidewalk mailboxes and'
special boxes it very difficult for even a'
which share do economy goes here that little space'
that's all that's left outside it was so
love %uh so
yes %uh there are you know
cities like New York and all that where the'
this could be sort of look that the couple do'
this practice there is a with a book girl I'll call sidewalks"
written by you know way colleague from UCLA'
shell the serious and
Rania your
few I think very difficult German I'll
published by MIT Press they put together a'
I don't think they have talked with the standard self"
of sidewalks there but the wonderful discussion'
the side
of
