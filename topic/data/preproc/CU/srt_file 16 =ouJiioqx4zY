I mean we need to translate awesome
[Music]
the site from all these geometrical
studies do you think there's something
ideological defined use usage of this
pattern because they're talking about
building a physical being in competition
for existing using that pattern and it's
not just about just about how four steps
function per second talk they talk about
you think usage of pattern this
architecture is our picture we see
diversity with accent but what we see in
all these examples is some kind of
homogeneous wickedness that I think
there's something ideological about
their accesses so when you are using
them I can when you're using them in a
new context like Israel is something I'm
not sure if they're in political
