Text description provided by the architects. In first instance, the parking fulfills a specific function: to host as many vehicles as possible in the least number of meters squared, in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Nevertheless, this project seeks to propose a new parking experience by exceeding the traditional program requirements. The architecture is then the result of an equanimous design process that ponders on the optimization of resources in search for more generous spaces than usual.Its prefabricated steel structure parts are assembled according to a modular grid defined by the plaza and maneuver widths. Four identical floors are organized according to a simple circulatory scheme of a street and ramp that allows an instant reading of the space and the available parking places. The service core is reduced to the minimum, increasing the amount of usable space. The ground floor allows the transformation of garage spaces into commercial premises; anticipating the corresponding facilities required.The diagrammatic order and constructive simplicity become an abstract prism with a homogeneous and translucent faÃ§ade. This compact and regular object is contrasted with the irregular geometry of the property in which an opportunity arises to build a new public space/plaza for the city.
