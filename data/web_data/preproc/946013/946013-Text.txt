Text description provided by the architects. The project concerns the restoration of a small 15th-century building attributable to Luca Fancelli.The main theme concerns the relationship with materials characterized by extreme fragility; the formal choices and the relationship with the simple spaces guide us to solutions that exalted the few signs still legible today.The internal doors and windows are large frames that suggest selective looks; the geometry introduced in the arrangement of the exteriors, made of few signs, enhances the extraordinary Renaissance facade.
