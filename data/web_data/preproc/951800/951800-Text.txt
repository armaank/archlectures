Text description provided by the architects. As written press changes over time Ouest France decided to create its own digital factory called Additi project.   The first French regional newspaper wanted a building capable of adapting to upcoming challenges while staying in their historical site.The project converts an old industrial garage creating a unique identity.  A metal mesh encompasses the entire building (including the roof) and protects it from the sun. Emergences create rhythm along with the long and narrow building.The metal frame supplemented by a concrete structure allows flexible floors. A suite of open-plan workspace, modular boxes, and common spaces enhance collaboration and community, as well as areas for private work.The double-height central street fills with light the offices on both ground and mezzanine floors.  All offices are scalable: suspended ceiling and ventilation systems serve each space. All pipe networks are visible and accessible above the acoustic panel cover.The wide openings on the outside and the various entrances create a strong connection with the outside.  The existing vegetation is maintained and reinforced, helping to create a vegetal setting for the project.
