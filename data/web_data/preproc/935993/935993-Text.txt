Text description provided by the architects. Following rapid growth in Asia-Pacific, global customer service and engagement software enterprise Zendesk required a new regional headquarters that would reflect its young, energetic, and humble personality. In support of the company’s commitment to nurturing digital and tech talent, this new 50,000 square-foot workplace stretches across one and a half floors and aims to double its current employee headcount over the next few years.Its design inspiration stems from the archetype of European towns where a big, central, buzzing public square invites large social gatherings, while smaller, more intimate neighborhoods dwell in its vicinity. Flexible working arrangements cater to diverse individual and collective needs, including team-based agile neighborhoods and height-adjustable desks for all workstations.Health and wellness are integral elements of this workplace, featuring a “mini garden” and more biophilia across all spaces, to clean the air and create smaller parks and green areas, bringing people closer to nature to provide a healthy work environment. To humanize the workplace, Singaporean artists were invited to create custom artwork and murals, helping to deliver a culturally relevant and dynamic work environment infused with local influences.
