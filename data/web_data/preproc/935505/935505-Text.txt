The concrete structure is the language of the entire building, creating frames on all facades.On the ground floor there is a parking lot, a commercial space and the entrance hall to the office building. These spaces are double height, which gives the commercial space and the entrance hall great presence and efficiency of space.The lobby was conceptualized with the minimum of materials, whit focus onthe marble and indirect light.The bold and functional design of the staircase results in a sculptural element within the space, inviting you to explore it.First and second levels are office spaces with an access hall and sanitary services.
