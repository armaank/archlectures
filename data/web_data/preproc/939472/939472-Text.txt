In the heart of an industrial area, on the eastern side of Tel-Aviv, between sheds, Garages and old office building, 8 Shtiebel St. represents the renewal of the Montefiore neighborhood.The new building aims to attract the vibrant startup community to this part of the city. Its facades are all covered with meatal panels, inspired by industrial spirit of the area, while adding yellow metal panels to bring new life to the neighborhood. The sliding shades enable the building to change its casting along the day and enable the tenants to choose between the city view and their own privacy.The building comprises 5 full stories and a rooftop level with open views of Tel Aviv skyline. The street facade on the ground floor is defined by a large yellow wall, a focal point in the industrial surroundings. On the higher floors, a system of sliding shutters forms the appearance of the building, creating a dynamic, constantly changing façade.
