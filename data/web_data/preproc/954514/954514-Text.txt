Text description provided by the architects. The Bugio project consists of transforming the entire interior of a duplex apartment located on the top floors of a building that preceded the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755. As the apartment was small and the client wanted to maximize the number of bedrooms, one of the strategies was to reduce circulation spaces to the minimum possible, changing the entire interior organization in order to make the relationship between spaces more effective, but always preserving the characteristics of the original apartment.Save this picture!© Carolina DelgadoSave this picture!PlansSave this picture!© Carolina DelgadoDownstairs the existing kitchen was replaced by the bedroom, with the new kitchen occupying the central space of the house. The space in the living room was enlarged both horizontally and vertically, unifying all the original details of the wooden elements (friezes, doors, shutters, door trimmings, footers ...).
