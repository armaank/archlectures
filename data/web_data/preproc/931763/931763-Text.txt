Text description provided by the architects. The client wants to spend his retirement in a house with plenty of gardens. In order to put the center of life at home in the garden, the connection between the garden and the house in the east is the beginning of design and the most important issue. In addition, the garden design direction is decided according to the connection method with the house, and it should be consideredfrom various viewpoints. The site is invaded by dead end roads and adjacent retaining walls, so it is narrower than the size of the garden and needs an appropriate alternative. In order to actively use the eastern side, where the gaze opens to the magnificent view of Inlleung Mountain and its gardens, some degree of terrain adjustment and three-dimensional connection are necessary.This project was carried out by the architect in charge of design, supervision and construction. In the course of many construction work, adjustments were made, and in particular, the work of touching the ground had many changes.
