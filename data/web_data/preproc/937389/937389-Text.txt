The mass of the right-hand side of the building is more massive as the private space of the main bedroom, while the left-side mass is transparent as a semi-public space such as the family room and dining room. Limited land, making this residence designed in a compact so that it can meet all the needs that exist.This house maximizes sunlight entering the building by making the building mass not stick to the wall.

The main entrance is designed to camouflage to resemble a window frame to maintain the privacy of the house from the road. The front garden is made with sloping fields to give a fresh and authentic impression.
