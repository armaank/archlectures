Text description provided by the architects. Nowadays, the line between private and public is blurring as individuals in Japan seek to contribute to society and connect not only with their friends but also with the entire country and the world through social networking and other forms of communication. In this social context, I felt the need to design the boundary between the house and society, so I came up with the design of a house with a mon(gate).In ancient Japan there was a gate at the interface between society and the grounds. We have evolved the old-fashioned gate design into a modern home design. The gated house can then produce the entire site and propose a new added value for living. The gate is the heart of the local community and the point of contact between the public and privacy.The function of this gate is to serve as a gateway to the land, a space for communication with the neighborhood, and a gate to protect the house, and we developed this house as a house that allows the residents to choose a sense of distance from the society by skillfully using the "closing" and "opening" functions of the gate. This gate can be combined with a Japanese-style room and a Doma (earthen floor) to suggest a rich lifestyle as a detached house.
