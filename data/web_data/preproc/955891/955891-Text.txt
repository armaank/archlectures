The summer house conceived as a small Cycladic complex of different white washed and stone cleded volumes, harmoniously blended into the nature and the terrains, looking towards the sea.The spatial composition of different volumes, all connecting with paths, terraces, stone walls and pergolas, establish a continuity between building and landscape. The layout proposes the main entrance and the communal areas on the larger, main building on the upper natural plateau, and distinct them from the rooms, which organised at different volumes at lower level. This configuration ensures that all the areas have full privacy and facing east, enjoying panoramic views.The Cycladic simplicity and purity exemplified by the white washed cubic volumes, combined with stone cladded volumes and walls made of locally quarried stone.
