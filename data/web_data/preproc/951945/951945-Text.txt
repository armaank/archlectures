The last part is the service area and garage placed on ground floor and all covered in bare concrete. All three-part composed make the whole house looking like floating box above concrete plinth with transparent living area in between.The whole 3 storey then tied together with main spiraling staircase which expressing itself in the containing glazed cylinder from outside.
