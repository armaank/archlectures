Text description provided by the architects. The project in question is an apartment building with seven stories and a ground floor, located in the General Paz-neighbourhood of the city of Córdoba.The project seeks to generate apartments that have living room and bedroom spaces with dimensions that allow their use in a comfortable and spacious way.Taking advantage of the split-levelling required by the official standards, a series of metal terrace balconies are designed as an addition to the main structure, which allows all the apartments to have their own exterior expansion.The sanitary facilities are centralized after a detailed study of their optimal location. They are located in connection with a technical ceiling, where 100% of the installations are hung, which will allow easy maintenance.Finally, for the realization of the artwork, which is a requirement of the municipality, a competition was held in which more than 20 artists participated, the winner being the proposal "Luna de Catamarca". The piece is a moon that lights up at night, located on the roof of the building.
