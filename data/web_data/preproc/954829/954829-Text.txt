Text description provided by the architects. Six prefabricated concrete slabs rest on two concrete walls which are also built in factory.This set of components, simple in their construction, layout and assembly, define the spaces and character of Lagos House. A single space is formed under these industrial pieces, which take on a new meaning in this domestic context. A series of light partitions are inserted to give identity to the service area.The house is thus presented as an accurate and neutral infrastructure that enables the user to encounter and enjoy the everyday activities whilst maintaining a direct link with the lake.
