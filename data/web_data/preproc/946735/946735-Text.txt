The L-shaped main building of the Sailing Centre not only fits the shape of the court on the north side, but also maximizes the facade on the sea side; The square cabin sub-building sits on a small mound, echoing the main building.Shadows | White sailing shadow solidifies into buildingsThe original design of the building was to shape two triangular sails: It likes a frozen white sail on the sea. The outstanding architectural form naturally becomes a landmark of the seaside, and also well explaining the functional properties of the building itself. A harmonious picture of architecture and sea, city and inhabitants.Sculptural | A simple attempt at modernismOn the south side of the building, there is a transparent and continuous glass curtain wall on the first floor and a special terrace on the second and roof.
