Text description provided by the architects. The L-shaped house with a 320 mÂ² footprint located in Berger, Nesodden, is built with multiple zones for a family who loves stairs. The shape of the building embraces a sunny garden from south-west while facing a great view over the fjord and Oslo.The ceiling follows the lines of the surrounding terrain. The geometric angle of the plan interacts with the steep slope towards west, creating a fence of the lush landscape. The project has overlaying areas, half-plans and spaces interlocked in each other, rather than specific rooms. It is a house made for people, connections and activities.
