Text description provided by the architects. The planning site (D23) is situated in the southwest area of the Seestadt Aspern /1220 Vienna. The three building sections with 4 to 5 storeys and a total of fifty homes are the first freely financed condominiums in this suburb.French windows, brick construction and spaciously dimensioned balconies and terraces ensure an amenable home feeling and revive almost forgotten qualities in housing.A special highlight of the project is formed by the colourfully ornamented cement tiles in the stairwell. Inspired by the aesthetic and tradition of (Viennese) Jugendstil / art nouveau, the modernist design radiates its own unique aura and identification potential for the residents.
