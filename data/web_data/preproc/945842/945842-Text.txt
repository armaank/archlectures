Text description provided by the architects. A couple of artists asked our office to renovate their newly acquired 2-bedroom apartment in District 2, Hochiminh city. Our main idea was to reorganize the living space by integrating the kitchen and dining space into a single volume of light and ambiance.As the natural light inside is soft and indirect most of the time due to the buildingâ€™s orientation, we opted for a raw, dark atmosphere with bare concrete to contrast with and bring forth the looming reflection on the metal surface.The touch of plywood panels is researched for its warm color. The bathrooms were remade to allow more light and air. The furniture was chosen for its simplicity and generosity, with a mid-century spirit.
