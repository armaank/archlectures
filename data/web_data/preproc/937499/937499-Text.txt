Text description provided by the architects. The land is 7 meters wide in north and south 36 meters deep in east and west.   It's a strip of land.   However, the clients hope simple layout and they're particular about the link of inside and outside in south where we can get light. So I pulled the house to north and I made simple long and narrow layout.  Besides, I made an inner court in south. I imitate fna-ishi  and useless small trees by simple against a backdrop of RC wall by circular wooden. It's like a picture when we see inside of the house. The clients can enjoy the change of time and seasons inside of house.   Because the house is like a picture which adopt nature well.
