A villa on a hill with a warm white theme.Â Using the white and warm texture of wood as the main character, we created a gentle yet light space in the green.The hot spring bath is built so that it can be buried in the garden as a separate area.Using the louver and the slanted surface, the surrounding nature and the building were directly joined.Created a "wooden white villa" in contrast to the "Concrete white villa" Savoie House.
