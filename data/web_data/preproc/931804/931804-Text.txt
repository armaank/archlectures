Text description provided by the architects. Condominium renovation work is carried out predicated on certain unchangeable existing components: reinforced concrete posts, beams and walls, for example, or the positions of openings.Undertaken within a framework involving such constraints, making careful considerations to bring strong points and shortcomings to light, the process has a sense of fine-tuning.Special care has been taken with regard to the tone of light and amount of space in each room of this unit in order to create a relaxed space in which to reside.
