‘Shunyo’ is a 100 sqm apartment unit that looks to create an inspiring story of simplicity and the esoteric. Designed with a clear intent to activate a surrealistic experience scattered between time and space, it serves as a multifaceted living pod where passions take a stance ahead and above bare necessities. Upon entering, one is immersed within the purity of the material palate, which is left bare, minimal and sometimes untouched. Conceptualized with  Black and undertones of Grey, the pod looks at exploring two completely different spatial experiences.With a large Monolithic Cast-in situ Concrete Table placed centrally, it holds the long perspective of the living space together, often blurring the lines between cooking, dining and entertainment. On the other side, the use of the continued Black from the living, allows a seamless transition between the central living into the bedroom. This area forms an unhindered space with limited furniture, balancing the “chiaroscuro” between the natural light and dark surfaces of the furniture and artwork.With the rawness of the concrete slab as the main canvas, the polished concrete floor adds a partially refined character to the entire space. The overlay of Black is used effectively to inject a sense of warmth into the space. With the overall experience coming together as a succession of narratives where all the spaces take up many roles, ‘Shunyo’ looks to capture this energy in its own esoteric approach.
