Text description provided by the architects. SPEED IS ELEGANCE "That which is fast is always beautiful" These words express the true spirit of Descente, a company dedicated to designing for speed and form. The name Descente means to descend in French, and with a focus on the highest quality, the name is a symbol of the brand's bold spirit which is always one step ahead of the times. This spirit of Descente is being brought to the rolling hills and rich greenery of Saito, Osaka, a base area for many research labs, where a new research and development center for the brand is planned.The five roofs are meant to follow the movements of the site and landscape (their vectors), and their shapes represent the speed and boldness, of the Descente spirit. The development office will be at the center of the space between the ground and these roofs, with various rooms on either side for supporting product development, including a measurement chamber, and an atmospheric testing room. By placing manufacturing, measuring, and testing together compactly, the plan makes the whole process of development feel immediately tangible.The vectors of the landscape seem to cross through the inside of the facility as well, allowing those inside to feel that smooth and refreshing flow as if they are working within nature, while also having spaces for development in which light and wind can be controlled. The 250 m track which encircles the inside and outside of the building brings a sense of action that makes you want to exercise, and ties together the people and architecture, which constantly supports the spirit of development.To continually develop sportswear for the times in a world where 1/100th of a second makes all the difference, this building will dovetail with the intuition of everyone working there, from the researchers to the athletes testing gear, creating a research and development center which can support high levels of creativity and productivity. It is our hope that the products designed here will move the hearts of those who love the Olympics, and sports as a whole.
