Text description provided by the architects. Private Residence No.3 is designed as volumes organized around perpendicular spines. This mass has been set in a garden with densely landscaped edges that have been raised to give the sense of being in a bowl of lush landscape. The parking court connects to an enclosed entry court through which one enters the house. The temple and lift are located to one side of the entrance lobby that continues as a circulation spine terminating at the vestibule to the bedrooms.The living and dining area form the perpendicular axis, visually connecting the front lawn and backyard. The warm wood cladding on the walls of this space contrasting with the stark whiteness of the surrounding spaces which are tied together by the grey flooring used through the house. The windows of the double-height living space frame views of the front garden and the sky. The material palette continues in the kitchen where warm wood under counter units contrast with the stark white surfaces and grey floor.A staircase adjacent to the dining area connects to the first floor where the master bedroom, another bedroom and a gym are organized around an entertainment area that looks into the double-height living space below. A landscaped balcony running along the front creates a shaded veranda below while modulating light the comes into the double-height living room and gym.  The façade of the house is articulated as a conversation between the starkness of concrete and the warmth of brick and wood that in turn engage with the voids and openings in the cuboidal mass in a manner that protects the interiors from the harshness of the exterior spaces while allowing them to engage with the landscape outside.
