「Unmanned capsule hotels」This hotel is a new "unmanned operation" that does not have resident staff in the center of Hiroshima City, which is close to the Atomic Bomb Dome, a World Heritage Site, and can be booked and settled online.While pursuing rationality in architecture, we thought that the hard part of the building would have a large impact on the satisfaction of the guests, and aimed to design a facility that would make us want to visit again. With a wide cabin-sized opening in individual spaces, there is a double-bed-sized mattress with plenty of room for two people to stay in one space.The structural material and the base are finished as it is, and it does not have a cheap impression by the balance with other materials, the color scheme, and the lighting while keeping the cost down, and it was a calm space like the accommodation.
