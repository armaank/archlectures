Text description provided by the architects. The essential loft was created for the CASACOR 2019 and its purpose was to offer a living área for the family to share happy moments. It was made to be comfortable, meaningful, and warm.Amongst the carpentry solutions, there were big wooden frames forming shelves that let the natural light and garden into the room and french accordion doors handmade with treenails.In the kitchen, we chose to replace cupboards with hooks exhibiting charming utensils and design pieces.For the nature admirers, space also had a botanical studio, where plants from different species helped to control the air humidity and temperature.Board games, reading área, all in perfect harmony came together to create this family living space, where the children, clearly, belonged.
