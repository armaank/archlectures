Text description provided by the architects. A new temporal Strate. This new floor stands out from the rest of the house by its resolutely contemporary vocabulary which is keen to interact with past heritage.On this top floor, the new roof addresses three different slopes in alignment with the existing parts.Â The differentiation of the slopes and the appearance of three distinct volumes is an architectural desire responding to a programmatic need but also in order to avoid a massive and monolithic project, crushing the existing house. In this register, the fault, central to the project, leads to a volumetric rupture.A space crossed by light. A glass crossing then comes to dig the volume. This then makes it possible to lighten the extension to cut its horizontality, modifying the exterior facade to elevate and refine the house.In addition, this light strip brings an undeniable spatial quality to the project which begins a new dialogue between interior and exterior.
