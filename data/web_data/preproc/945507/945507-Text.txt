Text description provided by the architects. Web bid for the closed architectural competition of new Lufthansa’s office in São Paulo and to be chosen as the winning project we designed a mix of open office and traditional spaces, as their briefing asked.We took advantage of the height and the big windows od the building to make the office a light place even with a dark blue paint at the concrete ceiling.The usage of an industrial language was preferred so we could bring the memory of the airplane and hangar materials.We designed a room that looks like an container and leaved all the installations ducts outwards.On the briefieng, Lufthansa’s asked for an office bleacher seating, so we design one with mix uses: stairs to the mezzanine, training room, living, day by day word and a storage underneath.Near the balcony, we designed the call pods, in front of a tree that it’s the preferred spot of employees.The biophilic study was considerate to provide an friendly atmosphere to the office.
