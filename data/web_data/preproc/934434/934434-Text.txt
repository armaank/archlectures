Text description provided by the architects. Villa Broeck is a detached private residence, adjacent to a nature reserve in the Netherlands. In this natural setting, Bedaux de Brouwer Architecten designed the building, the garden and its interior. The plot is located between a series of detached houses built along a crescent.Villa Broeck has the same shape as the surrounding volumes, however it has been rotated through 90 degrees in relation to its neighbours. Placing the building transversely creates a dramatic street elevation as well as a beautiful outlook to the scenery behind the house. Furthermore, it creates two special spaces: a patio as an entrance area and a sunken patio in the garden.A low volume has been constructed next to the main block, housing the kitchen. The residence, garden and interior have been designed in great coherence resulting in a series of intimate spaces and places that offer serenity and intimacy in the midst of a breathtaking landscape.Â
