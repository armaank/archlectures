Text description provided by the architects. The client , Dr.Libin T Balan is a Physician practicing in Vadakara.His family consists of  wife , two kids and his parents.The client’s requirement on the project was to have a soothing habitable space for their family with simple planning and uninterrupted family spaces. Dr.Libin was keen on bringing the nature inside and making it a part of their space.His requirements also included innovative design solutions to reduce heat and maximize air circulation throughout the interiors.The interiors were suggested to look simple  with creative ideas.The Axial House ,   located amidst of a busy town stands out from the overall background with its massive look showcasing a contemporary style of architecture with a perfect blend of landscaping.The facade showcase a certain simplicity of modernism through a combination of clean horizontal & vertical lines.The design of the landscape along with the architecture established the “ Spirit of the place”. The narrow rectangular  plot was proposed to have an axial planning concept where in all the spaces were arranged along a central axis which would serve as passage connecting the interior spaces.All the spaces are designed to get views of the landscape courts thereby creating a refreshing atmosphere throughout.POOL AREA is well arranged with the temple lamps and landscaping with vertical garden .The design of truss works at different levels adds great sectional value to this space .Continuous air circulation is generated  by providing louvers along the side wall.All the interior spaces have view towards the pool area and hence the presence of large windows also compliments to refresh the air continuously and circulate cool air. Perforated clay bricks for wall and clay tile for roof , reduced the external heat entering the interiors , which also helped to create interesting light and shadow patterns thereby making the interior court spaces more live.The  guest bedroom with cantilevered seating area has view towards this beautiful court.
