Oh
the 90s now so
this lecture is discussion up
discussion on houses city or how a
specific notion of geometry and standard
structure
please
candidates my work according to these
categories in oscillation
although words categorized use migraines
pollinate between projects silence
they will dissected
and because something new
my war dismissal even come up not least
on first
but it's not pursuing these interests as
a developer and not pushing new
formulations of damages you see you
nourishing technological agenda episode
my work is mother's photo of
I'm not mr. Lee
something
Oh
patience
I believe in dense darkness I see
clarity
yeah
junkies
I love that allows for both development
oral night
based on systems and intuition
but it's also question of politics
nice one
you're it
my self-initiated apartments I discuss
taste opportunity and also develop
awesome
research projects passionately
actual material
destruction
Samuelson is as a power forward
I'm over it yes develop certain common
technology
usually I work this
organizing finds work
I prefer to play or the projects and so
loud I mean all together
I quickly establish every all the major
joints and projects sexual relations
I found a card
as such
and rather destroy a stable
as the permits develop the original
system is
but there's always faces of
initial with John sometimes Spanish
sometimes services
as someone asking for a problem support
anyway we'll remove the change process
before
you know planning every project
standarized the man statistics
in Christmas natural life
and nationals bilaterals but all of his
abilities which has
around apiece points
and the years
this certainly processes
but involves series of negotiations
between given permissions
is mentally working
hyperspace not mysterious
facial all of you see my
but
bastards
which hastily
this main turn evil spirits
1:41 flying goatee
so he's like sir
further on this ad Sarkar now the
principles
have been expressed the word communicate
so our pictures company
and the worship compound and refer
our pitch is equal to practice now
scientific practice working with basic
work with it work with it really
to the site we read about an event
system with sessions
associate an assistant to a police based
on our latest products news
listen I have up but has since what 7
years I worked through million
relations between
hi other person and
seriously
which are mostly Protestants
two chapters
established
this is very recent project done with
a strange
this was an exhibition
outside Muslim
fifth year anniversary offices
by some Lightning
and art
many movies
this became de
and this setup
basically duration
existing collection network both Newton
and
asking
a very basic missed work
to tax applause
and we were
five different categories
in these categories we organized into
these two
shoes
some also some kind of assistance to
and provide any different
so that
answer
across categories
and
sectional
you see there
and reduce our submission calories
mostly masturbate
and
misogynist
we worked on
to us
to work with I'm smart
of people in Spartacus about us named
architect
kind of sleigh bells
we found Alana's birthday
first
and particularly sport on the coop
possible
for us we thank you our export
as
and then we found his 12 points for
basting marking fundamental points like
we found a very curious
say that this
[Music]
things
some services
for asking that more of his work he saw
perhaps a different side to
vote is pacified
I also make an analysis with the insight
and
my first business
the results from
Oh
the plants but in creatures
characteristics
till the time establish a personal
problem
I'm sorry
and apartments
so give mr. curious constellation out
that'd be
is more
there is one thing you have to calculate
out sight
what some of the background for our
project and then we do usually
once the land
twelve single architectures
sir
it's
the apartment
or maintains
I'm going to see
but we try to interpret them somehow
Inferno my I also work
our culture costing colleges in sample
the
with also untied advice to our genetic
it's how it used to be
our constant
thousands
and a spectrum developed with large
corporations
first orders which you see
which has no herbalist
our task was to make
that's fine one is clubs here
with certain qualities among suburban
policies
now it's kind of like a car Carlo
please class your apartment
you
the power which was based on a different
type of disability
so we studied
as
meeting points between white people
and they were one serving Bella one of
us type beat up
and this
this one type of
the buses we're project which can be
without any apartments
and we lost that one well house typology
for school year
and then start to meet
these pieces
into small clusters
and these posters be based one meter
great difference Oh
within the heart attack
very slight variations four types they
remain
and is public relations between
different types of
small muscles
Tommo rotate abuse
for me too a lot of the area
outside
a lot
for me very distinctly different artwork
second chapter
it was because Givens
this chapter percents not really
perhaps a smoker
wanted to test drives
it's not so much about the mansion and
all the attention
and perhaps this architect works on
production of platinum receiving an
autonomous automated approach in
continuity important studies ethnicity
administrative art Europe at the answers
society societal problems
and in turn is this
absolutely before
and this author is both mortified
correctly the newest additions and
this court to be fighting of missile
inspect Emmanuel Baptist
I find this particular interesting and
I'll beautifully
he was in from the new states
[Music]
for mass possibilities planet Venus must
be in
Austin Wilson values business
and only then can whatever is capable
perhaps some substances
getting back
so this speaks about the protagonist as
his
considering that rating is
and this is sort of the process
[Music]
g-money all these techniques and at the
end just gives the office
face way all Japanese organizations
one artist I
as work is
campus uses it works out basically Word
documents active exponent
and then it creates this pendant
Oh
this project first of all empirically
was the party that is right after
graduating Google and working one year
for a large office and
Esther or
so
to find my purpose
mutant is the person
the project is series of lines of text
which
[Music]
is a narrative
[Music]
artex agency who sets out to take over
control
it is not the crisis of our picture or
the problem
pictured a destination
no for agency by pumping and
that beautiful drama considerations
someone told me it's a global art
education
a multinational organization run by 0.8
m/s there's about a party of 20 student
before
the plan of the agency sustained rise
the entire for our children to learn any
form of Education
and to organize the economic condition
in which our edgeways produced
new materials and performance
enhancements or existing materials is
very important for dates
and part of a Jesus task is to be able
to trust a distant past our teacher the
court is establish new judges and a
legal system that begins incredible job
of securing artists politicians
developers and cities earnest needs
during the past eight years old
our fates we will use systems label
resolutions managed speaking complex
sets of eight
we find the most effective way of
shipping an assembly of architecture
the leaders of agency will get
confirmation
the leaders gave no explanation and no
excuses they do not feel the need to be
understood and provided innocence the
only way out in this beautiful
which one
it's a part of the national tourism
units particularly
assists of making small viewing
platforms in slim nature and providing
simple
like toilets and wastes the best safely
next to how the traffic box
so our project started with trying to
define our
Kaleo crystal stones and offices in
acceptance
- as inconsistent not not worthless as a
result of this made really can suspend
more experimental physics in an external
speculative
expansion
later on goodell nature experience the
rupture
the rotor promoted by multiply here with
18 cents
Stanwell nature where me to itself is
the pole
used to
first a basement
great
we saw one situated
I'm studying nature
ornate to us the survived
further he also became interested of
course in humans six days
these projects were percent attention
between sight and out sight between
natural and you are
this fascist
says most think I'll stop
the definition of a Spartan is expressed
through negativity not a scale not
architecture
logical absence world-making
not natural in opposition to that but
working magic is something you people
in other words we started fear
Thomas architecture sculpture
this is the backdrop and our site was
located in the very north in Norway this
incredibly scenic
you
but most people stop him.before was this
new heart
which has to be active and by addition
is furious obvious
but also turn around you see this man
[Music]
Sailor Moon by the dearly departed age
most people do not
so that began this project by having an
extremely
we'll set down to 572
for once
and also from the
push this down to the soil it is kind of
almost like a lotion
and you
developed some sort of practices
- one mr. Paulo
or you have a
so we want to use the spirit package
not one was that everything to rise
doorbell it's more than nine years the
landscape has
20 year look it takes 20 years but sort
of universe to go back so anymore
and lastly is
[Music]
Rachel
it's almost at the best resource of
aerospace and within these rules polymer
doing as much as possible
so our project describes this
hang your geometry
which is based on
package
give us insight so in which they
interfere
and there's the ravine which feel so and
toes into our budget
those projects is slightly skewed for
these ailments breaking plan
attention and the landscape
not performing actively
but also still providing to some certain
kind
time
and then
the plant plus is for nationals
and I particularly the stereo
it takes the middle of the road and
gives Nexus
for those who
somebody
all this
which is also the point where you go out
that's it
obviously don't ask me
both project
from
seriously
Oh
just
you still up for
sessions
conversations helicopter into sight
cyclin Factory
yes
want to animate long burden of the bench
suits apart
plastic grates on top
this project was
sometimes for
[Music]
no party has made some very standardized
poor things
and even the exceptional elements like
the mansion
Oh son
also establish humor skill
because after we sent out
someone fun huge hotel
we worked for years
most project is for the same time
services certainly
just kind of itself from the last module
very popular service and
this
our site will be located
basically
we worked on
establish this
and then
lose the series of operations on this
so
for a service
because to us
Oh
programming the life
Thomas
in system
now
to support
and then at the end
in the kind of mobilization mountains
the atlas yeah
[Music]
start talking structures and his books
we follow his product almost like an
apparatus and
some maps in order to strategically
place the videos
that
sort of storage
and stuff area
understand
this is larger
we looked at
section
because we wanted to have this
very strong
large
in Sicily and then we reacted to use
organizational systems
so
these large walls
we'll stop
[Music]
you see areas imagine also
and there is no brackets
[Music]
and in fact it has
it's important for us to successfully is
possible to
Sullivan shelter - wolves so it would
somehow intimate evening
what
temple
as part of the
[Music]
it's the last chapter
this
more specifically structure
some research
because this
yes
particular Congo's in
and he describes
I should call the school
which is very interesting assess it's
combination on the ruthless
open-mindedness imagine
[Music]
so on Sullivan submissions
there are kids in Chicago enough
it was more than a separate event this
and this simple fact explained or
deducted and the special
try to rationalize in brain structure
and also the way Congress wipes the
difference between the
and the Chicago
one in
and says both
if one last portrait
most
we're not
so nice to do it mister
was
first cast iron
no his services
and under people's guest Billy
it's the past and by the incredible
and all these kind of
Laird
[Music]
of course and things covered up Astrid
similarly
I became interested in
naturalist artist 66 habitus after it
very important
is nothing less than a true
which is Molly's just certainly
attitude or rolling more actively
as finish our kids
so they defined
the stories
besides that we should
this gabion
literally some
turning point
[Music]
the language for exhibitions
when also being flexible and not in
[Music]
our project Explorer has to use
14
about the budgets
given a site and/or an existing site
and we have four months from historic to
this was the way the Philippines - we're
staying for the intensive and they
prefer it this way so
you know buddy
a party which is warming from
scaffolding
and also what we will see stage sets
which
it separates an animal
encounter world
this project was for
Department of awards
and this is the Siberian
police
to make
actually
another premise of the project was that
everything
so we developed so the captain of the
elements
for us
category
the same time
apart from you
inside it was too
spacing huh
on the insert
and also
kinda basic security
[Music]
this will be a screen
which all have slightly palace
different colors
different types of
yes
as parts
at last which was it's a cinema that's
used for directors to check me this
reporter Sentinel
and
and that basically surgery
for services
and also mezzanine level
which
in addition it was has
series of all types
the sound incision
she found
unless they see spirits
Central Park
you see Morris
the first course incidentally
and so days
they worked a very special type of
Agriculture which
well
get away actually
his values and settlements
so the project takes on
poor choices
so unless in
with
most of our sincere whatever you see you
stop
and then a keyword exhibition again in
the county
it has this the sectional
dishes
before they face
again this
this could work
one of the
structures
or the trusses
that spam means that you born like this
that's it
the last projects
is associated ongoing projects
it's a
whole town
[Music]
sealing school
is now
targeted to be seen
stop by
yeah
[Music]
so that the hospital scene
was
they have certain
firstly
always
goodbye
work
they would have
so
if you want to start
they were in solitary
[Music]
to mine
so that each each
so
people go there
to us
the options museum in this courtyard
[Music]
are
hostess
in the structure
there's not a system
and therefore change existing
patience is written
makes the built-in country
of the other purposes and therefore
which is the important part
you startled us
[Music]
the session is work
or thoughts makes the space for openings
and on the second floor we connected
- arts community policy
and important for a circulation
our about
or
so you space
and this will be quite active for
the genome
[Music]
is raging elements
a spot go around or you can take
in the structure
if I wanted to
she's nice
meantime
so they use this
and curve
the span of course
and we have this a few evidence
which
slide
[Music]
I know this Friday
[Music]
address
but
and then there are finally
[Music]
and
in an era where were in
there
[Music]
or
under
this work elements
to use this tablet
- apartment psychosis as well
that's
in this art the magnetic service for I
think
we should talk about us trying to do
so
unless the client really wants
as realistic as possible is
the statistician
and in the survey
in the more collective projects they're
always working was either a publication
it's
just
they all
why
right
Deven
well I'm
and
sometimes that's
around someone for something is there
you wanna go there
jeez
setting us
[Music]
oh yeah
these together
just
that after you
but
bizarre
ah
the way
like the last projects perhaps because
it has
and I think
historical
[Music]
they started describing
sylia know
but us
we're sensing
I know I mean I like you I feel like
here what you access button
that definitely breaks down or I'm just
inaudible asking you
the one that stuck
that was their way of office above
so much procedure
[Music]
I
I
[Music]
Oh
our
it's never
and it's fun
explorers
[Music]
as
somehow
and then that's okay
source
there
it's net resting here
sketch out
[Music]
just doesn't work
worse yet
our question is
and how
I'm kinda curious at how
Your Honor she has
so comfy
I don't know how something
yeah
Oh
excuse me
campus
on something
is that the quotation started
process
because
for coming
because the word
there's other
yes
it would say class
tell me what I said
it's like
houses
so there any custom
who lays what today
the illnesses or
beyond
yes
Oh
boy those pissed a lot of projects here
are
hear about it
or it is sight in fact of the site if
you're not showing a drawing or at least
a staircase along the landscape appears
in fact within
that's where the idea of geometry and
sight
penalty's so the plans relaxed fashion
and question that geometry gotta work
so can you stretch now rectangles with
different geometric shape or it is not
romantic at all or any whatever
so what so the question is so facts
here sometimes besides according to
you're not able to see
what else is your
I'm sorry Billy is that a visual
language anyone instructed
see that basket or is it because there's
a certain
but there's two of us
of course
location
according to the site nothing
always
so
always
well
although one might not experience
somehow we discovered
different way that if it was all
Oh
or natural
Oh
right
experience
the else part
so there's
herself
because that's
doesn't look like
absolute tales
also having suit was
partly
so I think that's please
it's not that is
the culture
six
and they specially
take a little peek
other
or
and
[Music]
[Music]
Oh
stops
it doesn't stop within
in that census
this
[Music]
it's not necessarily manifest
[Music]
as ready
for something that you see
for parking
[Music]
it's also a see-through
most certainly
it's
and Matthew
as
ready
that
Leslie Nicole
because some yourself
well
because some randoms
unrealistic
I can pass for the
Theatre
goes on
like I created
someone gracefully
race
No
my face
for more
[Music]
