Good evening, my name is Rachel Garshick\nKleit, the section head for city and
regional planning here
at the Knowlton School of Architecture
and it's my pleasure to welcome you tonight to your
to the weekly Baumer lecture, and\nit's my pleasure also to introduce
Dr. Tridib Banerjee to you.
I have to say, I've read Dr. Banerjee's work for many years and I've heard
his name for a long time and so I'm\ndelighted to have been able to meet him
during his visit.
His thinking about urban spaces and planning
is brought in from my perspective, all encompassing.
He focuses on design and the planning of\nthe built environment
and the related human and social\nconsequences and some of the titles of
his recent
work illustrate this interest of the\nintersection in the built environment
and social consequences. One of them is called "Suspicion, Surveillance and Safety:
a New Imperative for Public Spaces," and\nit\'s in a book which
I love the title of, "Planning as if\nPeople Mattered:
Looking Back for the Future." Another\ntitle is "Conceptualizing the Child
Friendly Neighborhood: A Question of Form,\nFamily and Functioning."
So I said he was broad, from crime to\nchildren
in the built environment. Perhaps
in his work in planning theory, he has\nwrestled with other kinds of topics like
citizen involvement in planning\nprocesses as well as
attempting to reconcile the differences\nacross
the profession, practice and
academy in planning as a field. Perhaps his most cited work
is his 2001 Journal of the American\nPlanning Association article
which is entitled "The Future of Public\nSpace Beyond Invented Streets
and Reinvented Places," which outlines the\nimpacts the privatization globalization
and the communications revolution on our\nsocial values,
and how the public perceives what it\nwants,
in how it ask for public spaces,
and also on the supply of those public spaces and that's
a theme
that he\'ll come back to this evening. His\npublications also include "Beyond the
Neighborhood Unit"
with Liam Bear, "City in Sense, City in Design,"
writings and projects of Kevin Lynch,\nwhich have co-edited with Michael
Southworth.
And "Urban Design Downtown: Poetics and Politics
of Form," with Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris,
and currently has a four-volume edited
series coming out called "Critical Urban\nStudies: Urban Design" so you should look for
that in the future,
or very near future. He has been the\nAssociate Dean of the former
USC School of Urban and Regional\nPlanning, and also the Vice Dean of the
USC School of Public Policy,
and now this is the sole Price School,\nwhere he still is. Professor Banerjee is
a fellow
at the American Institute of Certified\nPlanners, a member of the Planning
Accreditation Board,
and is actively involved with the\nAssociation of Collegiate Schools
of Planning.
so it's my pleasure to have Dr.\nBanerjee talk to us tonight about public
space,
urban commons and urban design, thank you.
Thank you very much,
Rachel, for this wonderful introduction. This
is a real pleasure and honor to be here,
Ohio State University today, a
football competition of my university\nfrom time to time, but
not this year. I guess I should have
used gray in
deference to Ohio State, I probably should have had a red background.
But I don't think the letters would have shown up that well.
So I'm going to talk about
public space and urban commons and urban\ndesign,
some of this
the trials I will present actually\ncome out of my earlier work,
which Rachel mentioned, but also some\nwill be work that I've been doing now,
and it has been somewhat
of a consul interests for this
this concept a public space, so
 
there is an old medieval saying
"staftluft macht frei."
I'm no German speaker, but those of you who
know German probably would know that that\nmeans
that "city air makes one free," this is\nan old medieval concept that
when the Serbs came to the medieval city,\nthey became free. The city air,
when you talk about city air, it's not the,
you know, the air you breathe at home, but it's the air you breathe in the
public
that makes the concept of the public realm
an important part of becoming free.
And so,
this concept is rarely associated with\nthe freedom of expression,
freedom of speech, and freedom of
access, unused,
In fact, in times of political upheaval, as we are currently seeing now,
in the Arab streets, squares,
that the public realm plays a critical\nrole in shaping the
insurgency in movement for liberation
from the autocratic rule. The news and\nevents in Istanbul's
Taksim Square, for example, as you know, so\nthat the opposition, the
government plans to build a shopping\nmall, of all things,
in the middle of the prettiest
public space was not
really an acceptable use of an
icon for a larger sort of
autocratic rule, and a protest against\nagainst that rule.
So in all these
instances, you can see the public space\nhas become that kind of
important to the concept of their\nfreedom and political freedom and
democracy and so forth.
So what I would like to begin by the
roughly to talk a little about the idea of\npublic space and some of the arguments about
public space.
Kind of what I call a critical narrative of loss,
that has been around in the literature\nabout how
we're losing our public realm or public\nspace,
and that I wanted to use the idea the\nurban Commons
and talk about some other interesting\nideas that have been presented in the
urban commons,
and the question is whether public space\nfalls in the part of urban
commons, and then I have some concerns,
privacy concerns, about the future of the\npublic space
in the urban common recovery house, concerns that I have already
expressed in this article
and since ultimately architects and urban designers, planner
so the next question is what are some of\nthe challenges for urban design
in a general way.
So the essential argument, if you look\nat the major intellectual tradition,
you know in the social theory, they have
emphasized that the public spaces used
for social purposes
for possibility of conviviality,
social contact, the important part of\nmaintaining a good
society. In political theory, it has been\nassociated with what I said earlier,
democracy freedom, freedom of expression,
even first amendment rights in the\ncontract of the United State.
The feminist theorists have looked at\npublic space
and they have been little bit critical\nabout the other
sort of exuberance with the political theory about public realm and
democracy,
so they have some, a little it of
another view to that but
that has been covered a little bit in issue one, and then there's a liberal
economic theory,
who are also, have talked about public\ngood,
public space to the public good, but\nmaybe it should not be,
have to be, about the public good, and\nthere are some
interesting implications for that.
So in social theory,
like these slides, shows,
you know, the essence of the social\ncontact that
the social tourist talked about, the
left side of Millennium Park in Chicago,
the right hand side, the Union Square in New\nYork, Manhattan.
In the former case, the public art is become a setting for kids and
the parents alike and meet total strangers,
there's a high potential for social\ncontact in these instances.
The Union Square is enormously a popular
spot to hang out, especially for the\nyounger generation,
this is also multi-cultural, multi-ethnic\ngroup
and the multi-culturalism, the nature of what\nwe were doing, society in America,
is also an important part in the social theory mix,
that how the use of the break and the cultural agency, where does that happen,
and one argument has been made that nowhere else than public space,
that's why you need, you know, the\nstrangest people from other cultures and
other places.
Conviviality, Lisa PD talks about
convivial cities that we should b
aspiring to create, convivial cities with convivial spaces,
Here in two pictures, on the right, inside\na Plumber's park in West Hollywood,
and in the left corner is the
a little slice of a shot from
Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia.
So these are the places where people go\nto you know, play
chess, just to hang out or meet with the friends
and that kind of environment where you\nfeel comfortable, free and
you were willing to talk to\ncomplete strangers from time to time,
and that's the kind of spirit the public\nspace
sort of produces.
The public space of course doesn't have to\nbe an outdoor park,
public space can be here, in this\ninstance, for example, Grand Central,
one could think about public space like\nGrand Central, the place of
public life, where typically you might
go to hang out, they have restaurants around\nthere and they're not
just to catch a train. In fact, Grand Central Station for New
York is the place where
you'll be coming from a common place where you want to meet
your friend, just, you know, wait for me by\nthe clock,
on the right hand side of
the Grand Central concourse, or something\nlike that, so
so this is also a kind of an example of the public space
that is the important role in daily life. The job,
there's a notion of third places that Ray Oldenburg
wrote a wonderful book called "The Great Good Places"
in which, talked about third places. What're third places? Well
the first places are the place of where\nhe lives, second place is that place he goes to work or
go to school
and third place is a place where you hang out, and your quality of life
the city really depends on your access\nto third places, and how much time you
spend in
other places, and again he talks\nabout third places
as if they're all private places like cafes, coffee shops,
bookstores, bars, hair salons,
and other hang outs in the heart of a\ncommunity. That's the title of his
book, but it doesn't have to be,
there are some public hang out places too, so on the left hand
side you see the tier of the the National\nBuilding Museum in Washington DC,
we did the wonderful architectural space,
and it's a very, very popular public\nspace, mothers come with the strollers
and the kids,
you know the kindergarten class comes\nthere with the teacher,
out to spend the morning and afternoon. On\nthe right hand side,
you know in Berlin, their building, they start rebuilding Stadtschlosse,
the old city
castle that was torn down, or bombed
during the World War II, replaced by the
European, the East German Communist
regime, but now that that Bad Billy has been\ntaken out,
and they're now rebuilding that old Stadtschloss, only
in the outside, wouldn't you know it will be
I don't know, maybe a shopping mall, or\nsomething like that, but the the typical
German tradition, they have set up an infobox,
where you can go see the exhibits and\nstuff like that,
and this, the right hand pictures show, an example of part of this,
inside the infobox works, perfect\nstrangers, a mother with two kids, on this
older gentleman,
they have discovered your phone and they're\nlistening to the
stories that are telling about Stadtschloss, what they're
planning for it. This other kind of a place
that I think we need more of
in cities. From the political point of\nview, of course, the citizenship
is an important part of, expression, our public space symbolizes
the right to citizenship, in this case
in Los Angeles, some years ago when
the Congress was thinking about the tight
immigration law they wrote, this was spontaneous outpouring
of streets of Los Angeles of these
a these people without paper, basically
who are about to be denied citizenship,\nbut they're all pushing their babies who
are born in the
United States, and already by birthright,
claimed citizenship.
So, James Holston,
from Berkeley has talked about
this insurgent citizenship, the\nexpressions of citizenship rights,
where else can express, other than being
in the public space. Then,
you know the recently hundred square, this\ndemocratic movement the Arab Street,
the right handside, on the left handside, and\nalso Italian street,
picture Naples having some labor union\nprotests that were
wages, but the square is important, interestingly with
nothing but the big traffic roundabout, all of a sudden
became, but because it was a central\nlocation, it became the place that
the whole democracy movement
in Egypt began.
 
In her book "A Brave New Neighborhood,"\nMargaret Kohn
makes a compelling argument that, when it\ncomes down to it,
in the US at least, the first amendment\nrights
are the ones that make the public space
so essential to democracy. Both
her and the Benjamin Barber political\ntheories,
also has argued how important public\nspaces are
for the survival of democracy.
What is interesting about this writing, is that they're not architects,
they're not planners, they're not urban\ndesigners,
they're social scientists, social theorists
political theorists, that of qualities\nthat historians,
they're arguing, making a case for\npublic space.
 
The feminist theory, picking up on that,\nthey say oh yeah sure public space, an
important one, but they have to sell a\nplace in the continuum between the
public space and the domestic space,
but also, they are a little bit skeptical about
the mourning goes on among
the public realm, supporters
that they would have been a decline in\npublic spaces
so forth, so they argue and they talk about the old Greek
agoras, in the Greek democracy which took\nplace in agoras
for public space, so they kind of break separately, the people like
Nancy Fraser and Margaret
Crawford,
and they point out the lesson, guys,
don't get too carried away, but think\nabout the Greek city-state,
the folks who met in the world would\ndecide the affairs of the state are all
male greeks with wearing
togas and all that, but women were not\nallowed there, women were
home, nor would the slaves, so the\nGreek
democracies, they had a romanticized idealized form.
So women were not allowed
in the public space, and
in the right hand picture, the, some of the
Middle Eastern feminist writers have\npicked up on that, and said
that's right, in this, or what you see in the Islamic cities,
is that where the public space is really\nthe
space for man, home is a space for women,
and if you're in public space you are in\nthe intruder.
So a woman in a public space, you're the intruder
intruding the public space, and so\nwearing a veil, covering yourself up,
is an attempt to be invisible,
so to speak, symbolically, and here is a\npicture of the
 
square in front of the old mosque, what\nare obvious behind, you see some
woman completely clothed, and then on the\nleft handside, this
New Yorker
cover, which was titled Mother's Day
and what it shows, is all the fathers, except\nfor one mother
kind of walking into this play area, except
all the folks were there with the kids were\nall fathers.
Now, many mothers, the mothers are having\na day out, so the father is sitting
the kid, but there may be a subtle
a subtext to the spoof, that might be\nsaying that the fathers are out of work
now,
staying home taking care of the kids,\nmothers are the productive
members of the family, out in the job\nmarket
earning the bread.
I wish I had shown you, but some of you may know about this famous painting,
I think it hangs in the Chicago Art\nInstitute, by
and the Enrique Cape, the stop cable,
which shows a picture of
a french gentry walking the streets of Paris
immediately after
Haussmann's renovation of Paris
and what is interesting about the picture is that
every woman shown in the picture were accompanied by
gentleman. This is a late 19th century picture. Even in the late 19th century in Europe,
women were not supposed to be out in the\npublic on their own
unless they were escorted by their
husband, father, brother, son.
The only woman who are out there, on\ntheir own, were the
ladies of the street.
So even in Europe in the West,
the public space was very much limited\nto
access with women and so
but in the working after the invent of the capitalism,
consumerism,
you need women to sell materials, self\ncommodities,
so they had to devise the spacing on the\nright-hand side,
a wonderful invention in Paris,
as well as other parts of Europe, these\npassages are the gallerias
which are created with the shops
lined there and then this is where the women are brought to
do their shopping, and although this is kind of more of an acceptable way of being in the
the public, this was really sort of
a precursor to the department store, when you think of the department store,
how the departments have came about, is mainly because to bring women
to do their shopping, and so the women\nwere
eventually went to department stores on\ntheir own to do their shopping, but not
even in the late 19th century, they were not,\nbut these passages,
are still very much part of Paris, if you\nknow, they're
wonderfully restored, so this is Passage Choiseul,
in Paris, the way it was in the late 19th century,
and how it is today.
The political theorists talk about public sphere
public realm and
I think the sign on the left, this in Buenos Aires,
Estamos Mejorando, Espacio Publico, de todos, para todos,
we're
improving the public space
of all, for all, is almost of the linkness thing (?),
by all, would've been good, but didn't do that.
But this, I think, seeing this sign is actually pretty much self said,
Buenos Aires has a progressive
city government and they're emphasizing in the public space, the public realm
not just for the wealthy and the upperclass, but for everybody.
The bus, Espacio Publico, I think also is a wonderful
reminder that public space doesn't have to be stationary.
A bus is a public space also
and the public space of the transit is a former public space,
although it might be moving. Then there\nis a
thing about the public space as a public\ngood, it's the economic theory
which is that certain kind of goods are not
produced by the market, and these are the\nkind of goods where you cannot exclude
anybody,
so that non-excludable and non-rival, the\nconsumption of that good,
not a shortage,
deny somebody else from access to the\ngoods, and
so the public space was considered a\nsort of like a public good
is very much like the air you breathe, you know,
my breathing of air does not affect somebody else's breathing of air,
although if you're in Los Angeles,
you may think twice about that because\nthere are
areas of Los Angeles that are highly segregated,
by small quality, and
to the folks who live in the interior of Los Angeles be the significantly
inferior than the folks on the coast,
but recently the economy is certainly challenging this argument. They said
well and we're not sure that this is a
public space is a public good, they\nthink that the public space can be
provided
by also the private sector this
next picture here, is an example of a
seemingly a park, a public space, but this\nis part of a development in San Jose
California.
This is part of a complex of housing\nand shopping
and in the middle, they have this kind of nice,
you know, bandstand, the music is playing and all that.
So the economy shifts so well, here we go, this is a
public space, produced by private sectors,
so why just like a private good, so why do we have to
worry about not having enough done by
by the city.
But the question isn't the what's wrong with this picture, you
wonder, the problem with this
kind of public space is that they're really\nnot public space,
they're not publicly owned, they're privately owned,
and your presence there is only a privilege,
not the right, like being in a real city park,
therefore, there are a lot of things you cannot do,
and they can exclude you, they can ask\nyou to leave if you are not
wearing your hair right or you feel not wearing the right
kind of clothes, if you're wearing droopy
shorts with your underwear showing, or who knows what
what they might ask you to leave because\nthey think you don't belong there.
I'd like to tell you that I, myself, have been kicked out of
the American, the Great Americana, the big\nshopping mall in Bloomington,
Minneapolis, and all I was doing was taking pictures
and then finally they came up to me two\nyoung
folks like you guys and said
you know can we to talk to you, this is a long story but
eventually they wanted my ID, I said\nthat I don't think I have to
give you my ID, and they said finally so we'll call the police,
right, so anyway I left, and in fact it turns out that the police of
Bloomington, Indiana was protecting my
civil rights and he sort of chewed out this guy and said
just go, don't worry about it.
So there are those constraints,
they can ask you to leave, you don't have to worry about taking
pictures in a public space.
So I've been kicked out a couple of times but this was the most
intense of it. So, there is a sort of a kind of a
that there are three kind of narratives of loss of our public space,
one is that what's happening is that\nincreasingly public spaces are becoming
privatized, and
the public realm is therefore shrinking,
right, a furthermore loss of these spaces are places
where people like to hang out, meet, sort of
friendly places, they feel comfortable
are being kind of eliminated as part of
the new global economy with the wonderful expression that
the two political scientists
Kantor and Savitch talk
about global broom and local sweep, so\nbasically what
they say, the imperatives of global\neconomy is making the local
government actually cleaning out a lot of these older neighborhoods and places
is to provide wonderful urbanism and public space,
and the third thing might be a kind of a possible agoraphobia,
that with coming from the, you know, ICP in cyberspace,
increasing, you are spending more time at\nhome, on the computer,
we can order stuff from
my computer,
we can do just about everything from the computer, who needs
to go out and you have yourself a fear of\nothers,
of unfamiliar, in the public space,
so this agoraphobia, which means the fear of being out in the open,
might become a kind of reality for most\nAmericans,
as we get more and more
built, you know, sucked into this sorta of the
the cyberspace in several communities and
all of that.
So the next question that I want to sort of follow briefly is that, so what
is the idea of the urban commons on these urban space
and commons,
the legal scholars have argued that it is, although there are some questions,
social scientists have argued that the urban commons are for me to find unique
public culture of the city, but the problem with the notion of the commons is that,
you know, the Commons has all of the problems of
being over grazed, the tragedy of the commons, for this is
Garnett Harden's notion that if you
have a commonly owned property,
owned by sheep
ranchers, they could bring as many
cattle or sheep in the common space and\nthe maximize
their number of sheep because it's a free good,
but if everybody does that, basically the\ncommons disappear.
this is value and and yet the
the prod the other worthy tell you that\nthe fallacy that that will be kinda with
a rational behavior we have that\nsituation
it is rational who have your as many a
are their great a possible
you may think that them silly
but think about if you go out in a\nrestaurant with a bunch of folks
you decide that will be sharing the cost
the bill equally would you be ordering\nthe cheapest item in the
the when you are the was open to buy\nthem
think about you're probably go for the\nmost expensive I don't because
this is being sold socialized over right
so that so this is the congress argue\nthat that's
thats for the rational his now the
so the the Russell man cannot cooperate\nthis theory
argues but this has been challenged by\nother economies
like I want to Sen in a wonderful\narticle call
national rules so they rationalize man\nmust be a social
our show the
a to the question how do you can manage\nto discover their own comments
one choice is becoming get privatized\nWoodley
other choices yet the with government
to so running it
the new liberal cases for the\nprivatization based on the property
rights
but somewhat regular all strong
instance economy she has argued the self\ngovernance model
use this line could work too
so these p.m. %uh three new yorker
cover actually shows spoof on the
on the government to the left to the the\ngovernment then this is new yorkers
a.m. Nov it will they get
mirror Bloomberg is
so where the progressive active
policies lies in New York
so you know this is the government going\nto open up the middle of the city to
bring the
the comments the old Buffalo Common back\nin the game buffalo's control in the
middle of Manhattan
or you know you can have the public\npunishment for eating too much
smoking are salt or or
carb or in these way up
think he wrote this the the problematic\ntourist
to put them in a lil tourist pass and
that they can only stay in the tourist\nwill decide what we gonna
kinda divided partition the spaces so\nthese are the things the government
could do Total
that age their incomes so the of\nobviously
in everybody field that's not the like
thing now I wanted so the example of\nwhile
briefly that that we have in our human\nhistory there example self
of urban Commons and the one of the good\nexample about
the Medina's of Morocco in particularly\nfirst but then our
a with some pizza or and as you can see\nthe picture to the right
this is the cuddling district in
Morocco fares and basically
these are all on
they're all who sorry
ozone
so so this is the los kiero these old
ads and if you look at the you know the
either also be courtyard houses
but little a bill XP each other the\nquestion how did he get the city for
how did they manage to build it without\nany zoning code and
and billing a setback requirements and\nthings like that
well me this is can exactly the case of\na
self-organizing community the only thing\nthat guided
this process the bill the islamic i det
drive for Sharia law and some other kind\nself
ethical principles by Walker which meant\ndonating land for
public use and so for so this this
up
this community still survives and this\nis very much to the medical community
and if also broken up by Hills and so
the the institutional guild actually
manages the city so I love the this\nbasis
narrow spaces that disappear under the\nbuildings
so for all those kept clean and
supervised by folks who live there this\nso
he the the pic next picture for example\nshows
different with the house on the about\nand it shows how these
interior circulation spaces clean and\nwell-maintained
and all that flow seamlessly between the\nprivate space
boss and the public spaces and things\nlike that
so I'll know this assumption about the\npublic goods what are the different with
the public good in
public Commons the public good is a it's\nan honest ruble
on rival the comments ideas days non\nexcludable
what's a practical his exit yes\nconsumption up some of the Commons
means that you're taking them away from\nthe total Commons
I'll so the non rival assumption to the\npublic
good how r are under scrutiny in our\nthey said
the said most market goods can be up\nwith Publix
that's going to market goods I wanted to\nshape quickly
this how that happen so this is a his\nwebster
professor planning and it was a hong\nkong original Cardiff
he argued in this picture that this is\nwhat happens so when you have economic
just in case if you think the for\nexample
the guy with the PSSI Marco which is a\nnon-exclusive all
and non rival I mean you're enjoying
yes a son Marco affect anybody else
but what happened to be at the comarca\nget very cool
just what happened that just like when I\nwant this
ball and wanted to see the Sophia
long line well but
turned out that if I paid or
this in a lot of money I could have my\nown 20
or a different group who so by paying
so basically then I'm during his own of
non a still not excludable theoretically
by I'm now entering his own rival
the way but then eventually that might\nlead
to what he called be which is that on\nrival
and excludable case which is very much\nlike
the cities in southern California and\nmaybe in any metropolitan area
you how a yeah
basically by creating
if you are a member of the community you
you are you are not he
if you're not a member of the community\nyou cannot so their parts than
than playgrounds and things like that\nbut they're only
reserved for folks who live in that\ncommunity safe you don't belong to the
community
you don't belong there so there that\ncannot compromise then finally
you there I politics little witches what\nhas become completely privatized
and he think that this is this this is\ninevitable inevitable in the context of
up overcrowding yes so for the only way\nI can maintain
significant among the public space will\nbe through privatization
this is something that I want to sort of\nchallenge
with next life Sony the concerned about\nthe future published May
are in common so what they say is that\nenclosure up the common that these
comments should be divided people given\nsome rights
use that Commons I'll a second form of
loss 0 comments might be encroachment on\nthe Commons
than most other forms overgrazing look\nat
I and then there's the possibility about\nthe Asian up the Commons
the surveillance of the consulate this
so one one outcome of this and close up\nthe Commons is this picture
Sao Paulo Brazil you have seen this
this is not before the shop by the way\ndeal
it real real picture so what you see\nhere
the for their eyes a on the
the left inside here and in the\npropellers
was basically that they got the puck\ncreated
is gated community to this gaping be
from the community gated community\nbecame very popular these days
with their own tennis court swimming\npool on the public amenities
so they don't need to go to the public\nspace part have their own part
inside the gated community to this is an\nexample of the enclosure
the comp and so what happens then there\nare the procedural
spaces that the left what does folks who\ncannot
don't have the Acer money belong to that\ngot a gated community
but the gated communities and now become
very very popular all over the world the
third-world sorry yes
the third were a
economy the prospering you see now
number of these gonna develop Beijing
a gated community this is
a sign for similar kinds develop
calcutta in India about
the done by the p.m. developer for\nSingapore
I'll this picture if you see someone the
phenomenon of encroachment on the\nCommons
this thing the one on the left inside\nthis is gonna be interesting story from
economies
so the stories that didn't put you there\nthe one street
that had a direct view on fuji
but now they're going to build their big
power here basically blocking
the 1 would you know you up the month\nfood you want to argue
as part of the kind of the urban Commons\nand so essentially
what's happening here that other\npeople's right to develop
now taking away exhausting Europe\nuncommon the view
in a is interesting in San Francisco
were designed planned economy address\nthat and one other things about
somebody's government designer
the sketches with here that they
the this said all the high rise building\nshould be in the top of the hill
not at the bottom Hill because that's\nthe only
way can protect the view shed
the folks Hills so the sure there are\nsome interesting a redesign
implication about if you think about the\nview which is a very important
consideration was special the west coast
that's part of the urban Commons that\nyou don't want to lose
he and then we have this government\ngrowth would of course which
way was Hollywood sidewalk cafe
he's not a problem world who knows
would not because this adding to the\npublic life
urbanism so there are certain government\ncrossword we obviously allow
live with because it adds to the
urban urbanism life
a the squatters a you know
they arm through the K-seven overgrazing
the flow that the
to hard calls the Tragedy of the Commons
the column controlled were great well\nthey're not really over great
up really any other option there you\nknow them
you mean space and the
in the Sacramento case they have these\nthe homeless folks
the freeway or
ice are structure
is also they're not probably
as change that this like gays
wide are these cases the Lord grazing is\nadditionally then
right to get to know these things that\nthey're this
now the p you know one afternoon in some\nparts good walking why
Union Square hear these a test text of a\npiercing
soprano voice saying so that the
year piercing for the all the didn't bus\nOVA
sandwiches for downtown and then I see\nhere there
she is the way the Maiden Lane
the view I could picture
this bill is one of the real Frank Lloyd\nWright
jewelry store line I'll to this feed is\nactually blocked off
traffic and the palace faith
but he encroaching on public comments
and whatever right inside here in san\nTelmo this figure was Rs
very nice music on
joining well that's kind of an\nencroachment love the comment I guess
but but that's the kind of thing you\nprobably don't worry about
or for example in Little Italy
in or
York where fun genero day festival
all Street has been taken well
ferris wheel the kind shopping stalls in
would stall week this space is\ncompletely
occupied but with that sparkle
urbanism the public culture the city
I'm we have this kind 7 gotcha moments\nlike these
ladies in downtown Los Angeles
garment district you is a Los Angeles
silly still doesn't know how do reacted\nis because
technically way all codes logged in Los\nAngeles
that encroachment should mood but\nincreasingly
in the from the garment district area in\nthe in the
Broadway they are people are
be exhibiting their wheres
out on the street as custom is
from the culture that come from and so\nthey're kinda looking the other way
are not yet win to
movies I V I this picture from
Sokolow in City very calm
way the encroaching on the com I'll
yes by you know mexico's
are quickly or i'd they're probably like\nthem to be
but then you see in the streets of\nneighborhood street about
hello you know is gonna win
where you parked your the car the side
free out or you have a kind of this kind\nof a local
produce market was
temporary but this happens every day
serve the community so that's probably
okay to those adamant but then we pick\nup to
up for the same they were good they have\nthis guy
set up shop on the ire
so you have your laundry what your wife\nat ho
and get the ironing done by this guy the
corner yes set up this little showed
right like the sidewalk
nobody knows way that
like in fact that helps the folks who\nlive there
this is a heard the classic case so the
grazing or Holland to the riverbank
up someone what the dealer India
in Ahmedabad and so the city has
decided that will very definitively
to get rid of this whoa have a new
development plan and so
so these guys are all gone water
this is a common slut the river back
it's a water columns
so artworks what's happening there of\ncourse
the new plan for use the word call
would nice
shopping spree wall
should United water
Marshall problem place
it is probably job partly
in close because these are party\nprivately
own is stalls
I'll but the other word possibility
is not the obligation of the commons and\nI don't the warlike operations
the I just made it up what all it means\nthat from
come forward obviate meaning I'm not\nmaking it unnecessary
show so this is the worry is that\nultimately
with the public spaces not going to be\nrelevant
because if you can do everything
at home with your he laptop and computer
what this this picture the interesting
this is from yet you already
Wallonia de Polonia the one on the\nEuropean
sorry that you wonder why fly quite\nearly
and so what you see these kids that will\nonly the big University
all this university or hid their
here they are right next the old\nbuilding
this in this world sweet spot for the\nwifi
and Hero 3 film
what the cultural regan population
meeting there with their
worldwide not so
its so it just says that even with
the laptop you rather be allowed to the\npublic in a public space
28 the this so they're not yet struck by
agoraphobia was referring to earlier
and this was what he saw and was Rs PR\nla guardia
less is that apartment
artist I they have a facebook
you fight for the part and we go to that\nsite
you find all kinds of notices
things like the tree should be
there's a trim the trees are there a lot\nso empty beer cans
with up or you know those companies 0\ncomplains
what also you might find some notes\nabout
personal thing stories about you know\nthe cat leather
are you know that fell just like
the kind of social events that will\nhappen in the neighborhood level
and the when this artist cell the
other for example of how so this example\nor I think
the said the way that with the beginning\nto find out through social media
and the Internet might be able to\nconnect to our public space
at the in fact created new appreciation\na public space in
created with the public life show this\none
other up the Plaza
was he is word the long
and this is another example where
actually Diane number in your cell phone
listen to the story about that\nparticular space in the history of the
place
so so these are I think I it's not
although he be worried about mission the\nCommons
but that may not that for the case but\nwill have to
work on it a the other thing where you\nis that this a rail
that increasingly I'll this article that
in Rachel mention we did that some years\nago
before Snowden's revelations place
and now you know where under\nsurveillance
heavily why our own government
and so the weatherman Commons has been\nunder surveillance for quite some time
yeah it could be either a man\nsurveillance portions
wired Los Angeles are welcome Museum of\nContemporary Art
where you have the the video camera
City of London is full of cameras
both circuit cameras all over the place
and don't brief don't seem to want to\nI'd
what they're constantly watching this is\nthe kind of weapon uptick
gays digital were
thats constantly watching you and
so make you one gentleman said that
you know he is it a violation of my\nfourth amendment right
I don't know anyone no their going\nwithin
a marriage counselor or a for to the\nclinic or
why shrink a I don't want to be
seen are are recorded that they did that
so my giving up that a
the violation of the Fourth Amendment\nright to the search-and-seizure
well the legal this open court I said\nyour 4th Amendment rights
and when you leave your whole but they\nare arguing that no
we carry our fourth amendment right if\nso because if you don't do that
you don't have the right to what would\nhappen in increasingly people going
to cover so this hooting
wide kids units it's where with a jacket
is a way of governing this is you know\nthese
famous live in what cases with example
and the governing might have another way\nlove it
harris also rollers or who put on the\nWii eggs
big sunglasses to
that will be the kind of real response\ncoming up
I'll so a you know the
the city the berlin the tell you all\nknow that you are
undersell station some ways but OMG
inside the platform its heartbeat
no the camera are build
dot that are watching you
everywhere um him so
up so is that something to worry about
a some people who are you turning this
so what one feel safe ring
safety 11 public
others are they said this gentleman's\nargument
it's actually a low 2002
law review about if not that clear
because once you begin to give up his\nrights then
white back to on you
so the Inc conclusion moving towards the\npollution
thing up so challenges for a redesign
so what what are the challenges for\ndesign
given this display of
possibility is that a that are happening
so one is that a I think that there were\ndesigners should
maintain their advocacy urban Commons
we should think about urban common for\nthe protagonist in urban design
this is the term used by professor
you want to go Brazil from Sao Paulo
they're doing a study with saying we
we think about the the the space left\nbetween
buildings Street and other things in the\nspace
that we should be warning about this is\nthis is
so this is our protagonist in the design
show one would think a weatherman common\nto the protagonist
line then there is this the notion of\ndesigning the Aristotelian city is
opposed to the
atomic city this last work that Rachel
when should look for one in peace this\nunedited
be there when I after I did action\nsummarizing
the setup the history or design
in in developing or
question and it seems that it has taken
who tracks one is the political the\nPlatonic
track I'll very stick vigorous
definitive kinda landfill brasilia
gurus Chandigarh the example of the\nblack onyx
City the other side that is totally in\ncity
which is the design studio negotiation\nwhy
discussion which is and that the\nprovisional
participatory in the platonic City
the Philly designed by here or here\narchitects
who houses Norman Foster's and Frank\nGehry's
ruche they're the ones the design this
City in the Aristotelian City the city\nwe
see every day the designers are not open\n0
faceless they are the anti-heroes
and yet it is that though that the\nheroes
they are the ones who are in charge of\nthe the protagonist
their own comments the one they're have\nto design the
Herman fine or D what the
as powerful
so in the advocates for their work\nCommons a several things one is the
protection preservation
restoration of colin White and resources\non one other thing for
talked about but in a international\ncontext this city that growing
becoming overpopulated
cities leave China
India it's amazing and their
so they're the consular gesture\novercrowding
yet serious one that the economy's\ntalking about
in India for example with the thing is\nthat
something like fifty percent of all our\nresidents in Indian cities
don't have access to there are more
people in India who a real India who\nhave
access to cellphones but not gone
so why do people do where do they go\nwhile they use BR /1 comment
which is the riverbank the railroad\ntracks
and that's where the in the way
the worse for what you want dignity\nparticularly women
who cannot go their life
to the women go when the denied
Sandra shows so this is a new reality
I'll the BR /1 comment you know you can\nand closer one colony
protector powers but what about the rest\nbut defender
'em and so opening up in seven clothing\nor one comment that they would be a good
thing too
so advocate for and using the parlance\nthe billing the human capability in
dignity should be on the cover major
goal that is achieved so maybe Shipra\nwhite public toilets
wherever and however as many can
City India um
the other possibility is like
you know this is the sort of the\ngoverning the urban comedy
to from from New York City the Deacon
he close-up streets and up you know the\nkids play
this guy Wonderwall Oregon about school\nhoops and things like that on summer day
the city state's can redesign the\ncomplexities been designed to include
some features
this mental activities in Beijing they\nhave now they provide this
a a mechanical walkers on the sidewalk\nsale
while you're waiting for bus you're\ngetting exercise
so worry about the city that
maybe the public space the public Street\nspace care providers
that so I'm the new york city has done\nterrific
terrific thing rumor so the
much a broadway has been now replying
you space
does the parts are pretty
band their bicycle paths
and their this dead space is taken out\nby the
I'll use for sitting in all that
High Line Park in New York other very\ngood example of
recovering old abandoned
elevator render track and converted
part a so these are all the new\npossibilities
other think about it designing this\ngonna
is partly in City devoted to the
design your Commons so the designing for\ntheir starting in city
he designed for pluralism the board one
multicultural society diversity and\nmulti-culturalism
to pay attention to I'll justice and\nequity
in axis2 the Commons
I Michael Walzer talks about their two\ntypes of
spaces single-minded spaces and open\nminded spaces
single-minded spaces that this place is\na 941 particular function
open-minded faces the spaces spaces
that accommodate many different kinds of\nfunctions
so we should be defining open-minded\nspaces
then they are uncommon can accommodate\nmore activities
and youth the congestion affect so it's\na basketball court when the afternoon
kids
should basketball I in the evening
the elderly folks can come into that\nthey cheer exercise
same court in the same so no more fun
different behavior setting should be\nthinking about those guys
and up to my environmental Press lot
me with talks about but chill disable\nwere talking about how to make
and community lot of it depends on the\ndesign
Commons I maximum choices for you
functioning capability and create\ngreater control for users that Kevin
Lynch
all advocated 200 last line
a is that the in a way
one could probably come up with day\nlittle bit nerdy whale
were thinking about
classifying common
the close columns in postpone
ok common barry why
the principal arch by and
different levels the patrols obviously\nworth it
function are
the different kinds upon they play some\noverlapping
this can be vice reply talked about
so I just finish their review the part
about the going forward whether he could\ndo
things I think I'm
its short over five minutes or
okay thank you
out
0
but
up are
up
for you know I think something you see\nyou I think maybe the Bloomberg an
earlier era
Mayor Daley Chicago and Mehran than you\nknow
also I are Los Angeles they have all\nkind of
dedicated I'm so what a
they're all strong mayor I mean here we\ngo see the week mayor
basically the other two cases but nor\neven really have a lot of power
the City Council does but they
took the initiative to do the transit\nimprovement is a Los Angeles
was the very Gaza effort
and he he needed some some fantastic\nthings actually
very very innovative policies but but so\nso the
show in each of these three instances\nthe
obviously the mayor's them played a very\ncritical role
the Millennium Park in chicagoans other\nimprovements
and bakery way the recovering cost
chrome public infrastructure Chicago
a person rumor good amazing
from Benny called ones
sorrow hopes a glasses
to do
his the grumman these threesome
or really remarkable so so
you're right I don't think the planners\nthemselves can do that without some
good I'll leadership
or or support very people at the top
but I think the at least in the big\ncities there is a growing awareness that
in the people are becoming the merits\nand all that I mean you know we in our
this America revenue Mary Los Angeles\nand the mayoral debate the
this question about president developing\nthe question about you
the club the other bike path the\nquestion about public space
his are very much part of the debate
along with the No
you the Union wages and stuff like that\nbut the fact that those countries
issue that now the or yeah I think\nyou're very
encouraging signs I I would hope that\nthe the
planner sylvie designers will be
in a good good shape to
pursue their goals they'll have to\nsettle
you know brave enough gone talk with the\nmayor
they're always looking for ideas but\ntypically
winners then deal with timid
because the beaten up by the City\nCouncil
so often like to stick their neck out
at the other people be disorder
supported mission of
of
or
here
here
yeah I'm not sure I'll you you know what\nwhat we need to do
we've will mich white with that\nwonderful study of social use a small
public space
had done a study of side work in that\nway because they're waking hour with
them
wonderful principles ok design a plaza
although he did the ditsy year study\nsome the side good behavior
but I think you know I think again a new\nyork city
I'm a great fan of New York City the\nside of some new york city a very wide
the happens basically and a lot of\nthings have happened
without call what happened in los\nangeles's extreme
we have basically taken out sidewalk
space so too had that one more lie
for for car traffic so we have sidewalks\nin Los Angeles barely 45
why I believe in the utility pole and\nall the other
miscellaneous stuff to go on the\nsidewalk mailboxes and
special boxes it very difficult for even\na
which share do economy goes here that\nlittle space
that's all that's left outside it was so
love %uh so
yes %uh there are you know
cities like New York and all that where\nthe
this could be sort of look that the\ncouple do
this practice there is a with a book\ngirl I'll call sidewalks
written by you know way colleague from\nUCLA
shell the serious and
Rania your
few I think very difficult German I'll
published by MIT Press they put together\na
I don't think they have talked with the\nstandard self
of sidewalks there but the wonderful\ndiscussion
the side
of
