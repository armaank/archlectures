Welcome.
And I see many\nguests from outside.
Aaron, you must be a superstar.
I'm Anita Berrizbeitia.
I'm Chair of the Department\nof Landscape Architecture.
And thank you,\neveryone, for coming.
I am very happy to introduce\nAaron Sachs to those of you
that don't know him.
He's Professor of History\nand American Studies
at Cornell University.
And he will talk to us\ntonight about a history
of environmental justice.
Environmental justice\nhas been a core value
of landscape architecture\nin the United States
since the field was founded at\nthe end of the 19th century.
We can argue that\nOlmsted was first
an advocate for environmental\njustice and then a landscape
architect.
Perhaps even, but in\nlandscape architecture,
he found the most\nproductive venue
for acting on his advocacy.
And many in that generation\nof landscape architects
were as invested in\nseeing the laws passed
to protect landscapes as\nthey were in making projects.
That commitment to\nsustained reflection
on the relationship between\neconomy, environment,
and people has been consistent\nin our field to this very day.
One well-known example,\na very recent example,
is Kate Orff's and Richard\nMisrach's Petrochemical America
a photographic and cartographic\nanalysis of pollution
and the effects of\nAfrican-American communities
in what is known now\nas "Cancer alley."
Yet, although filled\nwith good intentions,
our discipline has\nbeen, and to this day,
is, continuously faced with\nambivalence, contradictions,
and difficult ethical\ndilemmas for which
there are no easy answers.
As geographer Don\nMitchell has written,
"Landscape hides all kinds of\neconomic and social inequities
beneath its\nscenographic beauty."
And while recognizing\nthe imperative
to expose the dark\nside of landscape,
I am equally interested in the\nunfinished, unresolved project
of landscape.
By this, I mean the\nproductive effects
that this ambivalence\ncan have in our work--
how it moves us to innovate,\nto navigate between conflicting
aims, to search for\na better relationship
with the natural world.
For this, we rely on the help\nof historians, and especially,
on our Aaron Sachs, whose\nwork probes these difficult
questions.
Aaron received his Bachelor of\nArts in History and Literature
from Harvard University,\nwhere he wrote his thesis
on Clarence King and\nthe great frontier
surveys of the American West.
He went on to pursue a\nPhD in American studies
at Yale, for which he wrote\na dissertation on Alexander
Humboldt.
His first book, The\nHumboldt Current--
Nineteenth-Century\nExploration and the Roots
of American Environmentalism,\naddresses the complexities
of the famous explorer,\nscientist, abolitionist,
and proponent of the\ninterconnection of all
of nature.
To this day, Humboldt's sections\nthat correlate elevation
with species distribution\nand spatial pattern
continue to be core\nknowledge in our field.
Yet at the same\ntime that Humboldt,
through his great vision\nfor a unified natural order,
he argued against\nslave-based economies
and against colonialism.
He also surveyed\nand mapped mines
to support mineral\nextraction of silver and gold
on behalf of his\nimperial funders.
Sachs then maps\nout for us not just
the connections, the various\ncurrents between Humboldt
and American-environmental\nthought, but also,
the complex\nrelationships between
romantic and utilitarian\nnotions of nature
that define so much\nof cultural production
in 19th-century America.
For his second book, Sachs\nturns from exploration
in distant territories to\nrepose and commemoration nearby.
Arcadian America-- The Death\nand Life of an Environmental
Tradition revisits places that\nwere designed specifically
for mourning and remembrance--
Mount Auburn Cemetery,\nSleepy Hollow
and the Native\nAmerican burial ground
are three seminal landscapes\nin the history of our field.
Together, these two\nbooks map extreme scales
of landscape engagement,\nfrom the global
to the immediate and\ndomestic, from the scientific
to the deeply personal.
While doing so, Aaron\nSachs has written,
in addition to Humboldt,\nabout Olmsted, Andrew Jackson
Downing, Horace Cleveland,\nHenry David Thoreau, landscape
painters, such as\nFrederic Church
and Albert Bierstadt, geologist\nLouis Agassiz and Asa Grey.
That is the full constellation\nof characters around which
the field has developed.
He is currently working on Lewis\nMumford, and green urbanism,
and on the history of\nenvironmental justice,
about which we will\nhear more tonight.
A vivid writer, both lyrical and\nhumorous, around Sachs's works
lies at the intersection of\nenvironmental and landscape
architectural\nhistory, and as such,
gives us greater insights into\nthe broader meanings of design.
We are very pleased to\nhave you with us here.
Please join me in welcoming\nAaron Sachs as the [inaudible]
Olmstead lecturer.
Thank you so much, Anita, for\nthat really kind introduction.
Also, thank you for\ninviting me here.
It's an honor.
Thanks also to Ken Stewart,\nand Paige Johnston,
and Alaina Fernandes.
And of course, thanks to all of\nyou for being here in the calm
before the storm.
I'm honored to be giving\nthe Olmsted Lecture.
I'm also just\ndelighted to be here.
I grew up in Newton, just\na few miles away from here
and still love coming\nback to the Boston area.
It's definitely home for me.
I'm also just so grateful\nthat the Red Sox finally
signed JD Martinez, because\nthe offense was really a mess
last year.
I should acknowledge\nat the outset
that my guiding influence,\nwhenever I give a talk,
is Thoreau, who said\nin Walden that what
he looks for in his reading\nis "perpetual suggestions
and provocations."
And he also said in a week\non the Concord and Merrimack
Rivers that he\nthought, a good book
is one that makes its\nreaders dangerous to existing
institutions--
just so you know my intentions.
And that leads me to the\nlaunching point for this talk,
which is a picture of my car.
It has New York plates now.
But I actually inherited\nit from my mother.
And you can see\nfrom the stickers
where my allegiances lie.
And of course, it's a Prius.
And I just I Find.
It so interesting that\nthis one model of car
has come to symbolize American\nenvironmentalism so thoroughly.
I'm sure many of you in this\nroom, if you drive a car,
drive a Prius.
And we all, I'm sure, love the\ngreat mileage that it gets.
Personally I also love\nthe way that it handles.
I've found that I\nreally only need
to use one hand on the\nsteering wheel, which
leaves the other hand free\nto pat myself on the back.
And I wanted you to know\nabout a new Prius that is
becoming available very soon.
[video playback]
- A lot of auto makers are\nrolling out green-energy
vehicles.
But Toyota says its newest Prius\nis the most environmentally
friendly car ever produced.
The secret-- it\nkills its driver.
Toyota calls it\nthe Prius Solution.
When the driver\nenters the Solution,
the doors automatically lock.
And a seat belt\nsecures him in place.
Then it's time for Toyota's\nrevolutionary eco-spike
technology to go to\nwork, impaling the driver
through the heart and lungs.
Ads for the solution\ntout the fact
that it's the only car\nout there guaranteed
to reduce its drivers\ncarbon footprint to 0.
- The newest member of the Prius\nfamily is the greenest member--
Prius Solution.
When you're dead,\nyou can't pollute.
- Over 1,000 eco-conscious\nAmericans have already
preordered the Solution.
- I mean, if you care\nabout the planet at all,
it's the best car you can get.
If your car doesn't\nkill you, it's like,
what's even the point?
- The car does have its critics.
Some are complaining it's\nirresponsible of Toyota
to not use recycled\nmaterials in the construction
of the Solutions killing spikes.
But Toyota is betting on\ncustomizable features,
like the family Solution, which\nkills up to six people at once,
and the Green Gardner, which\ngrinds the body of the driver
into an organic fertilizer\nto create healthy demand
for the Solution.
Members of the media\nwill get a chance
to test-drive the Solution\nat Toyota's annual Green Car
Convention this Friday.
And this lucky reporter happens\nto be on the guest list.
So for the last time ever, for\nTech Trends, I'm Scott McKay.
[end playback]
OK, I am working on another\ntalk called "The Climate Change
Comedy Hour."
but don't worry.
This is not that talk.
This is the environmental\njustice talk.
I promise.
So it's funny.
It's also a little\nbit uncomfortable,
which means I have you\nright where I want you.
It's funny, I think,\nfor a number of reasons,
among them, that the\nenvironmental movement
has always been a\nlittle bit anti-human.
It's as if\nenvironmentalists have
bought into a notion\nof human nature
that sees overconsumption and\ndestructiveness as the two
clear overriding\ntendencies in our species.
So then it becomes logical to\neliminate destructive behavior,
with something like\nthe Prius Solution,
in order to meet the goal\nof saving the planet--
rather abstract goal.
I actually have a\nfriend and colleague
named Jenny Price,\nwho's working on a book
with the working title right\nnow of Stop Saving the Planet,
which I would highly\nrecommend when it comes out.
It's strange, I think,\nthat so many of us
are still so focused on that\nabstraction of the planet.
Remember learning in school\nthat there are basically
three metanarratives that create\ndramatic tension in literature?
There is man-versus-man.
And I'm sorry for\nthe sexist language.
But this is how we\nall learned it--
man-versus-man,\nman-versus-himself, and
man-versus-nature.
Well, it's as if\nenvironmentalists only
learned the last two.
What about man-versus-man?
What about the\nsocial, political,
economic, and cultural context\nfor environmental degradation?
The domination of\nnature, historically,
has always been intertwined with\nthe domination of some people
by others.
And anyway, aren't\nwe really talking
not about saving the\nplanet, but trying
to save the human beings who\nare living on the planet?
And once we're talking\nabout saving people,
don't we need to acknowledge\nthat some people are far more
vulnerable than others, and\nthat their vulnerability is not
their fault, nor random,\nbut rather directly
related to the historical\ntrajectories of especially
capitalism and\ncolonialism, both of which
have explicitly treated\ncertain groups as expendable?
In other words, I think we need\nto attach the idea of justice
to our environmentalism\nif we want
to have a meaningful movement.
And in fact, the\nenvironmental-justice movement
now, perhaps best represented\nby the climate-justice movement,
has provided great cause\nfor hope-- for me, anyway.
But then again, what\nis climate justice?
And I don't ask this\ncynically in any way.
I'm not trying to be like one\nof those critics of the Occupy
movement who\nberated them for not
having a clear vision\nof what they wanted.
I think, for me anyway, it\nwas clear from the beginning
that they wanted to get the\nquestion of economic inequality
back into the\npublic conversation.
And I think they actually\ndid that quite successfully.
And that was part of the\nreason Bernie Sanders
had such momentum in\nthe first half of 2016.
And if our democratic\ninstitutions
were somewhat more robust, then\nhe probably would have won.
But back to the question,\nwhat is climate justice?
And I see it as a true\nepistemological problem clearly
related to the centuries-old\nproblem of defining justice
full-stop.
We can begin to see what climate\ninjustice is, because we know
that the richer, more\nindustrial nations created
global warming and the poorer,\nless industrial nations
are experiencing the worst\nimpacts of global warming.
We can look at the 2\nbillion people living
in dry-land environments\nwho are finding
their traditional farming\ntechniques are not
working so well anymore.
We can look at the\ntens of millions
of refugees who are\nfleeing from coasts,
and islands, and\ndelta regions because
of higher-frequency and\nhigher-intensity storms
and the resulting damage\nfrom wind and water.
And of course, we can look\nback at the industrial world's
investments in\ntowering buildings,
elaborate energy and\ntransport systems,
and massive manufacturing\noperations, all of which
demand more and more\nfossil-fuel consumption.
So the ethics are\npretty clear here.
What is not so clear is what\nto aim for in addressing
this kind of massive problem.
Just to start with,\nthe obvious way
to get at the root\nof the problem
is to stop releasing\ncarbon into the atmosphere.
But that does absolutely\nnothing for the people
who are suffering from\nclimate change right now.
It's the tired, old\nclimate-change question
of mitigation versus adaptation.
The international\ncommunity is starting
to have a conversation\nabout human beings' rights
with regard to climate\nand environment,
and also, just as important,\nabout nations duties
and responsibility.
But the conversation\nhas a long way to go.
Scholars and activists\nare coming at this problem
from every angle\nyou can imagine.
Legal studies, sociology,\ncultural studies, literature,
ethics, political\ntheory, and publications
about environmental\njustice and climate justice
have exploded in the\npast 10 years or so.
I'm proposing here just to\nmake some small contribution
by attempting to think\nhistorically about the problem.
Historical thinking\nhas some advantages,
I think, in this context.
Perhaps the key lesson\nof historical analysis
is that all change\nis contingent.
Nothing is inevitable.
And that alone is\ngood grounds for hope.
And hope is one thing we need.
History has a lot more\nethical purchase, also,
than something like climatology,\nfor instance, because history
is based on the\nfacts of what has
happened instead of\non models designed
to forecast our future.
History can, of\ncourse, be depressing,
because it forces us to confront\nthe truth of how consistently
human beings have perpetrated\nhorrors on one another.
But it can also be\nprofoundly connective.
In the case of\nenvironmental history,
it can remind us that societies\nhave survived and thrived
under many different\nkinds of circumstances,
including many different\nkinds of energy regimes.
In the end, I think most\npeople find something resonant
about the question\nof where we came from
and how we got to\nwhere we are today.
My parents were homebodies\nand did not take my sister
and me out very much.
But I remember\nvery vividly, when
I was a kid, the one\ntime I went to the MFA.
This was the painting\nthat I remembered seeing.
And my father was a\nprofessor of French
and explained that this\nis asking the question,
where do we come from?
What are we?
Where are we going?
Of course, climate justice\nand environmental justice
have relatively short histories.
In the last couple\nof decades, it's
become clear that\nboth movements have
incredible potential\nfor breadth,
and solidarity, and\nconstructive action.
But both have also been hampered\nby significant problems--
by vagueness about what they\nare and what they're doing,
by internal divisions, ,\nand especially by the charge
of nimbyism and\ngeneral negativity.
I'm sure you guys have\nencountered the acronym,
"NIMBY," Not In My Back Yard.
"Backyard" becomes two words to\nmake it a better-sounding word.
"Nimbyism"-- that\'s been\naround for quite a while.
More recently, there's\nanother acronym
that\'s been thrown\naround, which is "BANANA."
You might not know this one.
It's, Build Absolutely Nothing\nAnywhere Near Anything.
Certainly, part of the problem\nwith environmental justice
comes from the complexity of how\nenvironmental and social issues
intertwine.
But part of it also comes\nfrom the very specific history
of our thinking about\nenvironmental justice.
In theory, environmental\njustice is fundamentally
the goal of equalizing\nthe distribution
of environmental benefits\nand environmental burdens--
benefits being things like,\nclean air, clean water,
green space, soil; and\nburdens being really,
any form of pollution,\nor climate instability,
loss of biodiversity,\nimpoverishment of ecosystems.
But in practice, the\nenvironmental-justice movement
has almost always crystallized\naround instances of injustice--
organizing, gaining\nmomentum in order
to halt construction of an\nincinerator in a minority
neighborhood or to\nsue a chemical company
for poisoning working-class\ncitizens who had very
few affordable housing options.
Most environmental-justice\nnarratives
that have reached\nthe general public
basically follow the story line\nof the film, Erin Brockovich.
That's from the year 2000.
And I if you haven't seen\nit or you don't remember it,
there's a cancer cluster.
Turns out that the utility,\nPacific Gas and Electric,
has been paying\npeople off, taking
care of their medical\nbills, and covering up
the fact that they've\nbeen releasing
hexavalent chromium, which\nis an anticorrosive chemical.
In this case, it was being\nused for cooling towers
at a compressor station\nfor a natural gas pipeline.
So there's a successful lawsuit,\nwhich makes for a happy ending.
Julia Roberts gets\na $2 million bonus.
Lawmakers even make a\nvery tiny adjustment
in the amount of chromium that's\nallowed in the environment.
And then we're back\nto business as usual.
Most scholarly work actually\nfollows this same story line,
with just one difference.
In the movie, it's Hollywood.
Everybody's white.
In the scholarly work,\nit's almost always
about communities of color.
And in fact, most\nscholars, I think,
would trace the\nenvironmental-justice movement
in this country back to\nAfton, North Carolina,
in September, 1982, where\nenvironmental justice was
really first defined as\n"environmental racism."
The state of North Carolina\nhad applied to the EPA
for a permit to dump\n29,000 metric tons of soil
contaminated with\nPCBs, polychlorinated
biphenyls, the chemical that had\nmade Love Canal famous in 1978.
Afton was 84% African-American,\nhad a median annual income
of $6,984.
And EPA's own rules should have\nmade it impossible for this
to happen, because according\nto their own regulations,
there has to be a 50-foot\nbuffer between ground surface
and underground water table.
But in Afton, the\nunderground water table
was between 10 and 15\nfeet below the surface.
And as it happens, almost all\nof the residents of the town
got their water from wells.
Nevertheless EPA\ngranted the permit--
were in the Reagan\nyears, remember.
And I put a little note in my\ntalk here saying, "Don\'t rant,"
because I can't I can't\nbelieve that people
are looking so fondly back on\nthe Reagan years these days.
But I won't get into that.
There were 500\ndemonstrators arrested.
And among the marchers\nwere white male farmers
from the surrounding\ncountryside,
white female\nenvironmentalists who
had been radicalized\nby Love Canal,
worried black mothers\nfrom Afton proper,
and some of the most\nprominent African-American men
in the country.
This person in the front is\nthe Reverend, Benjamin Chaffetz
Jr., who later went on to\ncloud Director of NAACP.
So this was really an exciting\nand promising coalition
of environmental\ntypes on the one hand,
and social justice\nand civil-rights
types on the other.
North Carolina soil had become\na kind of common ground.
The one major downside, which\nis not really unpredictable,
was that there was no support\nfrom the major mainstream
environmental groups.
They were focused\non other things.
Nevertheless, even though\nthe state of North Carolina
succeeded in building its\nhazardous-waste facility,
even though US\nenvironmentalism continued
to focus more, in general,\non wilderness wildlife,
this uprising at\nAfton did become
an inspirational\nillustration of the potential
for a broad spectrum\nof activists
to join together in\nchallenging the structures
of social and\necological domination.
The environmental-justice\nmovement made great strides
in the 1980s and '90s.
New activist groups formed, new\nscholarship started coming out.
At the grassroots, organizations\ndemanded more information
about toxics, more transparency,\neven more inclusion
in environmental\ndecision-making.
Scholars, meanwhile, were\nproving quite vividly that
the most vulnerable\ncommunities around the world,
usually poor people of color,\nwere breathing the most
polluted air, drinking\nthe most polluted water--
basically being\ntreated as expendable--
again, very clear ethical\nimplications, in fact,
much clearer than in many of\nthe other major environmental
disputes of the late 20th\ncentury involving things
like spotted owls\nand dammed rivers.
I happened to start a job in\nan environmental organization
in DC called the Worldwatch\nInstitute in January of 1993--
this was after college for me--
the same week that Bill\nClinton and Al Gore
started their new jobs in DC.
And it was a time of really\ngreat hope for anyone
who was interested in\nenvironmental justice.
In 1991, the first\nNational People
of Color Environmental\nLeadership Summit
had produced 17 core principles\nof environmental justice, which
encompassed not just\nsustainability and antiracism,
as you might expect, but, also\ndiscourses of public health,
human rights, antimilitarism,\nself-determination,
political participation.
And then in 1994,\nPresident Clinton
issued an executive\norder specifically
on environmental justice,\nwhich was designed
to prevent the\npractice of placing
hazardous-waste facilities\nin the kinds of communities
that were least-well\nequipped to mount a protest.
That had been a very\nexplicit strategy.
And many of us at\nthe time were really
encouraged by this\nexecutive order
and thought that it might even\nhelp manufacturers start trying
to find ways of producing\nless hazardous material
in the first place.
Unfortunately, at the\nsame time, Clinton
was making it\neasier for companies
to shift their\ndirtiest operations
to other countries via\nNAFTA and GATT, for example.
And then by the late 1990s,\nglobal climate change
was starting to dominate\nenvironmental discourse.
And when you're invoking\nplanetary crisis
and impending doom, then the\nlens of environmental justice
starts to seem narrow and local.
And so it fell off\nfor a little while.
When I was at\nWorldwatch, I tried
to jump on the\nenvironmental-justice bandwagon
and published this paper.
And I show it just because\nI got it out a few weeks ago
to reread it.
And I was just kind of\ntouched by remembering
this moment when\nnonprofit workers would
produce these little\npamphlets and hand them
around to other nonprofit\nworkers, and professors,
and graduate students.
And it just it seem so different\ntoday with the internet.
But I stand by the\neffort that I made
in that paper to frame\nenvironmental justice
in the broadest terms\npossible to examine overlaps
of social and environmental\nissues at every scale,
starting with individuals\nwho have been deprived
of basic human rights,\nbecause of their environmental
activism, for instance, to\nspecific local communities
that, say, have higher asthma\nrates because of air pollution,
to nations who\nmight be struggling
with cross-border pollution\nproblems or something
like regional water scarcity,\nto international organizations,
like the UN, seeking\nto protect both
the substantive human right\nto a clean environment
and the procedural rights\nto assemble and speak out
to defend one's environment.
But I wasn't a historian\nwhen I wrote that paper.
And ever since I\nbecame a historian,
I've been thinking back\non it and wondering
how I might be\nable to bolster it
by thinking of\nenvironmental justice
not just as a movement dating\nback just a few decades,
but as an idea dating\nback much further.
And it continues to\nstrike me that a longer
history of\nenvironmental-justice thinking
could help us, at\nleast a little bit,
move beyond the problems of\nnegativity and vagueness.
We should be able\nto articulate more
precisely what we want in\nexplicitly socio-ecological
terms.
Lately, some people, I\nthink very productively,
have been turning towards\nspeculative fiction
to try to envision a better\nsocio-ecological paradigm.
But my effort is going to\nbe turning toward the past.
And I think lots of\npossibilities do open up.
Even if you go back just a few\nyears to Love Canal itself--
and Lois Gibbs was the most\nfamous activist from Love
Canal--
Love Canal helps us go\nbeyond race and class
to add gender to the mix.
The kinds of health problems\nat the center of the Love Canal
scandal, mostly birth defects,\nare still generally treated
as part of the family realm, the\nprivate sphere, which is still
often gendered as feminine.
So it's that much more\npowerful, I think,
when women start marching in\npublic protests and insisting
that the men who-- at the\ntime, they were all men--
running governments\nand chemical companies,
need to be held accountable.
Holding men accountable is\nvery hot right now right.
That same theme arises gender\nif we look back to 1973
and extend our reach\nto northern India,
where the women tree-huggers\nof the chipko movement
launched their campaign to\nstop government-sponsored
deforestation, which often\ncaused flooding, and siltation,
and fuel shortages\nin local communities.
Women were usually\nthe ones doing
the labor of collecting\nwater and fuel wood.
So the chipko\nmovement also helps
us incorporate labor issues\ninto the environmental-justice
paradigm, as do these two.
Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta.
If we look at the situation\nin California in 1965,
when they led the United\nFarm Workers in a strike
against grape growers,\nwhose insistence
on the use of certain\npesticides, many of which
are now banned,\nthreatened the health
of both the\nsurrounding ecosystem
and the pickers themselves.
So workers' rights, like\ncollective bargaining,
I think are also crucial\nto any conception
of environmental justice.
And there was a social\ntheorist at the same time
in the mid '60s who was putting\nall of these social issues
together with\nenvironmental issues.
And that was Murray Bookchin.
And if you haven't\nread Murray Bookchin,
I would highly\nrecommend him to you.
This is a Vermont\nintellectual far
to the left of Bernie Sanders.
In 1965, he published\nan essay called
Ecology and Revolutionary\nThought, in which he said,
"The imbalances man has\nproduced in the natural world
are caused by the\nimbalances he has
produced in the social world."
and that, for Bookchin, started\nwith the age-old structure
of the patriarchal family.
Gender was always at\nthe heart of his theory,
which he called "social\necology," and which, I think
is pretty synonymous with\nenvironmental justice.
I like to use "environmental\njustice," because
of the resonance of\nthat word, "justice."
But Bookchin is one\nof the best theorists
we have with regard\nto this intertwining
of social and\nenvironmental issues.
And ultimately, what he\nproposes as a positive vision
is an intensely\nparticipatory society--
a series of de-centralized\nconfederates
of human-scale\ncommunities, founded
on the principles of free\nspeech, free assembly,
engaged citizenship,\ngender and racial equality,
and shared resources.
Social-ecological\nthinking, Bookchin argues,
"must extend itself into a\nbroader libertarian tradition
that reaches back into the\ntribal or band-type communities
ancestral to what\nwe so smugly call
'civilization,' a tradition,\nindeed an abiding human impulse
that has surged to the\nsurface of society in every
revolutionary period, only to\nbe brutally contained by those
purely societal forms called\n\'hierarchies.\'" I love
the phrasing there and the\nemphasis that hierarchies are
not natural.
They're purely societal forms.
This line of thinking\nconnects Bookchin in 1965,
back to many generations of\nintellectuals who could be
considered part of a long\nenvironmental-justice
tradition--
people like the urban critic,\nLewis Mumford, or his mentor,
Patrik Geddes, or the Russian\nanarchist, Peter Kropotkin,
or the French geographer,\n lis e Reclus,
or the American theorist\nof the single tax on land,
Henry George, or my personal\nfavorite, as Anita mentioned,
Alexander von Humboldt, whose\nwritings take us all the way
back to the beginning\nof the 19th century.
So when I first\nconceived this talk,
my intention was to\ngo back to Humboldt,
show how he was an\nenvironmental-justice thinker,
and then push even\nfurther back to show
how he had been influenced by\nearlier debates about land,
and property, and theories\nof distributive justice.
So I started reading\nRousseau, and [inaudible],,
and Thomas Paine,\nand John Locke,
Robinson Crusoe,\nwhich I think you
can interpret in a\nreally interesting way
in this context.
And I do hope that\nI'll eventually get
to make this into a short book.
And I just thought\nI would lay out
how I'm thinking about\nthe chapters here.
And I would be happy,\nin the Q&A discussion,
to talk about any of this.
But I'm not going\nto flesh it out
right now, because ultimately,\nI got kind of obsessed,
in the past few weeks, with\none clear, concrete example
of an environmental-justice\nformulation that
goes all the way back\nto the 17th century.
The key thinker here is a\nrelatively obscure Englishman
named Gerrard Winstanley,\nwho, for a few centuries,
was mostly lost to history.
But his writings\nwere rediscovered
in the late 20th century.
And I think it's fair to\ncharacterize them retroactively
as a series of\nenvironmental-justice
manifestos, delivered during\nthe English Civil War,
mostly in 1649 And 1650.
A less anachronistic\nway to describe them
might be as\n"passionate arguments
to protect the commons for\nthe use of the landless poor."
He was he was a\npamphleteer, basically.
This is one of his pamphlets.
And you can, just\nfrom that language,
start to see what\nhe's getting at.
At the beginning of April 1649,\nWinstanley and about two dozen
others started\ndigging and planting
on St. George's Hill\nin Walton on Thames,
the area was considered\na commons, or waste,
a piece of land neither\nowned nor regularly planted,
and therefore traditionally\navailable to poor people
as a place where they might\ngather wood or graze livestock.
But Winstanley and the\nso-called "diggers"
were looking not\nonly to solidify,
but also to broaden the rights\nof so-called "commoners,"
in line with the democratizing\ntendencies of the English Civil
War--
the word "commoner" is\na very interesting one,
which, for a long\ntime, I just thought
of as indicating an\nordinary person-- not
a member of the\nnobility or the clergy,
but a member of the Third\nEstate-- a common person.
But I think it's\njust as important
to think of "commoner"\nas meaning somebody
with rights to the commons.
These diggers burned\naway some of the heath,
plowed the dirt, planted corn,\nbeans, parsnips, and carrots,
declaring their\nintention, quote,
"to eat our bread together\nby the sweat of our brows."
Basically, it was an\nexperimental commune.
And they invited poor people\nfrom around the country
to join them, encouraging\nthem not only to claim land
for their own use, but also,\nto withhold their labor
from the local lords.
The next month, May of\nthat same year, parliament
declared that the Kingdom\nof England was no more.
This is the English\nCivil War again.
And the nation was now\nofficially a commonwealth.
In this context that\nword meant mostly
that the monarchy had been\nabolished, King Charles having
been beheaded,\nand that a new era
of wider political\nparticipation had begun.
But the word "commonwealth"\nalso resonated
with earlier meanings.
In the previous century,\nas large landlords
had launched what became the\nEnclosure movement, claiming
more and more common lands\nas their own for profit,
a counter-movement of\npoor people had arisen.
And they called themselves\n"commonwealth men,"
emphasizing the responsibility\nof the rich to help the poor
and attacking this new\ntrend toward profit-seeking.
The lords had lost some\nof their military power,
and they were looking\nfor more economic power.
We can think of these\ncommonwealth men
in the 16th century as\nforming a movement in line
with some of the ideas expressed\nin Thomas More's Utopia, which
was published in 1516.
And if you haven't read it or\nhaven't looked at it recently,
I'll just remind you that on the\nsmall island nation of Utopia,
all men and women must work.
There are no idle\nlandholders, because there
is no private property.
And in fact, there had been\nno private property in England
until these lords started\nthe Enclosure movement.
Winstanley was quick\nto seize on these older
meanings of the\nword "commonwealth,"
as he argued that the\nnew version of England,
to be true to its\nidentity, would
have to reign in the wealthy and\nensure that all commoners had
free access to the commons.
The poor, he pointed out,\nhad contributed greatly
to the overthrow of the\nmonarchy-- paying taxes,
serving in armies.
And the parliamentarians\nhad indeed
promised them a new freedom.
The language Winstanley\nused in making
these arguments of course, comes\nfrom traditions in theology,
and philosophy, and politics\nspecific to his time and place.
And yet, I also want to argue\nthat his discourse represents
something both new\nand incredibly durable
in its articulation\nof the environment
as a shared resource to\nwhich all human beings have
an equal claim.
"Let us dig on the\nhill," he says,
quote, "that we may\nwork in righteousness
and lay the foundation of making\nthe earth a common treasury
for all, both rich and\npoor, that everyone that
is born in the land may be fed\nby the earth, his mother, that
brought him forth,\nnot enclosing any part
into any particular hand, but\nall as one man working together
and feeding together, not\none lording over another,
but all looking upon each other\nas equals in the creation,
so that our maker\nmay be glorified
in the work of his own hands,
and that everyone may see he\nis no respecter of persons
but equally loves\nhis whole creation
and hates nothing but\nthe serpent, which
is covetousness."
Unquote.
"Let us dig on the\nhill," he says,
"and practice\nusufruct," a word that
arose in English at about the\nsame time as "commonwealth,"
"to show that what matters\nis not ownership, but use,
to show that, in fact, private\nproperty is a curse, since,"
quote, "those that buy and\nsell land and are landlords
have got it either by\noppression, or murder,
or theft.
"Let us dig on the\nhill," he says,
"because in the\nbeginning of time,
the great creator\nreason made the Earth
to be a common treasury to\npreserve beasts, birds, fishes,
and man, the lord that was to\ngovern this creation, for man
had domination given to him over\nthe beasts, birds, and fishes.
But not one word was\nspoken in the beginning
that one branch of mankind\nshould rule over another."
Remember man-versus-man?
Man-versus-man is\nthe real problem.
"Go about your\nbusiness, you landlords,
and let us dig in peace.
We told you that we\nwere not against any
that would have magistrates\nand laws to govern
as the nations of the\nworld are governed.
But as for our parts, we\nshall need neither the one
or the other in that\nnature of government,
for as our land is commons,\nso our cattle is to be common,
and our corn and fruits of\nthe earth common, and are not
to be brought and sold among\nus, but to remain a standing
portion of livelihood\nto us and our children,
without that\ncheating entanglement
of buying and selling.
And we shall not\narrest one another."
OK, I could quote Winstanley\nuntil the cows come back
from their common grazing area.
But you get the idea.
And of course, you can predict\nthat his diggers would not
be able to hold out very long.
There were, in fact,\na few other communes
that arose around the country.
But in every case,\nthe local gentry
came down really, really\nhard on the rebels,
attacking them on\nhorseback, setting fire
to their crops and huts, driving\nthem away within a few months,
because these planters\non the commons
represented such a direct threat\nto the protocapitalist system.
And remarkably, at\nexactly the same time,
similar scenarios\nwere playing out
across the ocean\nin the Americas,
as colonizers\ngradually encroached
on the various commons\nmanaged by native groups.
Native Americans\nof the 17th century
did not leave behind much\nin the way of documents.
But based on the\nknowledge that we do have
of their land-management\npractices and cultural-belief
systems--
many of these groups, anyway--
we can note the almost uncanny\nparallels to Winstanley vision.
These native groups did\nnot live in a wilderness
as John Locke would\nargue, but in fact,
under a regime of collectively\nowned property, to which
all human beings were\nbound under an ethic
of careful, equitable,\nsustainable use.
Now of course, there\nare limitations
to Winstanley discourse.
We can't just lift it and\nuse it in the 21st century.
He was dealing with a pretty\nhomogeneous population
of white Christian men.
I don't think he ever\nchallenged the authority
of the patriarchal family.
He consistently did endorse\na universal egalitarianism,
but we're left to wonder\nwhether he would have applied it
to people of color, like the\nblack Africans already being
enslaved by his countrymen, or\nthe Native Americans already
being dispossessed\nby his countrymen.
I think Murray\nBookchin surely would
have approved of\nWinstanley invocation
of a kind of primitive\nsolidarity and anarchism.
Still, to most modern ears,\nthis form of communalism
probably sounds\nromantic and naive.
I just have to admit that\nI've found it very helpful
for myself to travel\nback to a time
before the discourses of\ncapitalism and colonialism
had been fully\nformed and justified,
before many people took\nAdam Smith and David
Hume for granted and assumed\nthat all human beings would
always just dominate,\nand accumulate,
and covet, according to\ntheir own self-interest.
The idea of the\ntragedy of the commons
has been thoroughly debunked\nby now-- most notably
by the Nobel-Prize winning\neconomist, Elinor Ostrom.
But many environmentalists\nstill assume
that it's impossible\nto protect any commons,
because each individual\nhuman being is
inherently bent on\nconsumption and destruction.
For me, Winstanley at\nleast represents a moment
when it was still possible\nto invoke the collective
over the individual, the common\ngood over private advantage,
when it was still\npossible to speak
of a universal right to direct\nsubsistence from the earth.
Winstanley often uses the word\n"livelihood" in this context.
It's even important to me\nto consider the implications
of Winstanley's embrace\nof humanity's domination
over nature.
And I'm sure many of\nyou noted that language.
Some environmentalists\nstill blame
the Judeo-Christian\ntradition for its emphasis
on subduing the earth.
But in Winstanley\'s\nwritings, "dominion"
does not mean exploitation,\nbut rather, responsibility.
Yes, we all use the resources\nof the Earth to survive.
But it's our duty to protect\nthem and share them equally
with everyone, precisely because\nthat dominion was granted
to every single human being.
The physical material fact\nof the commons for Winstanley
correlates with a\nvision of commonality
for all human beings.
I think environmental justice\nhas too often been theorized
as something that\ndivides us, leaving us
with victims and perpetrators,\nwhich in turn, leaves even
the most idealistic\nactivists embittered.
And that embitterment\nis absolutely justified,
because, in fact,\ncapitalism and colonialism,
for the past 400\nyears, have clearly
raised up certain people\nat the expense of others.
But still, it's\nimportant to find ways
not just of righting old wrongs,\nbut also of moving forward
as inclusively as possible, like\nat the end of the Black Panther
movie, which I would be happy\nto talk about if people have
seen it and are interested.
And if you haven't seen\nit, you should see it.
It's the cultural conversation.
OK what does Winstanley\nand his legacy--
what do they mean in 2018\nhere in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts?
The abstraction of\ncommonality is important.
And I'll come back\nto that briefly.
But especially since we're\nhere at a design school,
I wanted to pause for\na moment and embrace
the physical material commons\nas a site of possibility
for the environmental-justice\nmovement.
In a way, maybe\nOccupy Wall Street
was as much about that as it\nwas about economic inequality.
We need to claim as\nmuch public space
as we can, where we can act as\ncommoners, where we can embody
our role as members\nof a community,
where we can care jointly\nfor shared resources.
I realize this might\nbe very old-hat
for a design-school audience.
But couldn't it be helpful\nto redesign our cities
with a new emphasis\non the commons?
I'll just mention two\nhistorical examples
that I find compelling.
I hope suggesting how,\nthrough our experience
of physical commons,\nwe could gradually
try to bring our culture back\naround to putting a higher
value on the common good.
One could, of course,\ninvoke Olmsted himself.
But I happen to\nlike even better,
a landscape architect named\nHorace Cleveland, whom
Anita mentioned at the start.
He was from Massachusetts.
Some of you will know him,\nsome of you might not.
But after the Civil\nWar, he moved out west
to Chicago and then\nMinneapolis and St. Paul,
where he became the primary\nplanner of the park system
there.
And if you've ever spent\ntime there, even in winter,
you know how well used the green\nspaces are in those cities.
There's a real network of parks.
And the lakes become rinks for\nskaters and hockey players.
And I think the reason\nit's been so successful
is that Cleveland so\ncarefully emphasized public
over private space.
I was learning about\nthis, and I was
sitting in the archives,\nin St. Paul actually,
and suddenly thought back to\nthis place in Newton, where
I grew up, called Crystal,\nLake which is a lovely spot.
Some of you, I'm\nsure, have been there.
And I've taken my kids\nthere, and it's wonderful.
But there's only a\nlittle slice of it
that is accessible\nto the public,
because mostly, it's\nringed with private homes.
And that slice is\nrun by the city.
And it's open for a\nfew weeks in the summer
for a few hours each day.
Otherwise, you have to be one of\nthe very lucky people with one
of those homes.
But in Minneapolis and\nSt. Paul, specifically
by Cleveland's order,\nhouses were permitted only
on the far side of the road that\nwere built around the lakes.
The city had to quote,\n"reserve for public use
every foot of land\nbetween the avenue
and the water,"\nwhich made it clear
that the entire\nlake and shoreline
were intended as a commons to\nbe enjoyed freely by anyone who
wandered into the neighborhood.
And then one more example--
my favorite 20th-century\nurbanist, Lewis Mumford
wrote about this community,\nSunnyside Gardens, in Queens.
He actually moved there in 1925.
And he framed it\nalso, as an attack
against the\nprivatization of space.
From his perspective,\nprivatization
had given rise to new feelings\nof isolation, alienation,
apathy.
And if you're interested\nin Sunnyside Gardens,
and you also like\nfiction, there's
a great novel by Jonathan\nLethem that just came out
about five years ago called,\nDissident Gardens, that
is actually about this place.
It was designed by Mumford's\nfriends, Clarence Stein
and Henry Wright.
And the idea was\nthat there would
be lots and lots of residences\nthat were oriented inward
toward the green spaces\nat the center there,
which were places where\nthe children could play
and adults could stroll\nthrough the gardens
and have gardens, where they\nraised vegetables and flowers.
And the whole plan was meant to\ndefy the suburban model based
on isolated freestanding\nmiddle-class homes in order
to foster constant\ncontact and an investment
in communal living.
As Mumford put it,\n"When dwelling places
were understood as social units\nwith the visible coherence
in the architecture,\nwith a sufficient number
of local meeting rooms\nfor group activities,
as in Sunnyside Gardens,\na robust political life
with effective collective\naction and a sense
of renewed public\nresponsibility would have
a good chance of developing.
Effective, collective action,\nrenewed public responsibility--
let's hope so.
Maybe we could even take\nresponsibility for the climate
as a kind of ultimate commons.
Could we perhaps say that\nevery human being has
a right to a livable climate?
Well, with every right\ncome responsibilities,
duties, obligations.
To ensure the preservation\nof the commons,
everyone has to be\ninvolved in its management.
Mitigation and adaptation\nare equally important.
And both require\nsystemic change,
which in turn, will\nrequire sacrifice.
At the 2014, People's\nClimate March
in New York, one,\nof the key slogans
was "To change everything,\nwe need everyone."
The more you've benefited from\na relatively stable climate,
the more you owe.
I would urge you,\nespecially, to find
ways of offering direct aid\nto those who have suffered
from climate instability.
Alternatively, we could all\njust buy a Prius Solution.
Thank you.
I'd love to take questions.
Yes.
Thank you for that\nincredibly provocative talk.
To take up your\n[inaudible] provocation,
I ask the following.
Towards the beginning\nof the talk,
you began with the holy trinity\nof race, class, and gender.
And so I'm curious--
the glancing\nreference to religion
as such or\nJudah-Christian precepts.
And I'm not referring here\nto Murray Bookchin, who
could very well, in fact, quite\npossibly went to grammar school
with my grandfather\nin the Bronx.
And we can look\ninto Isaiah Berlin
to see the generation\nof dissident Jewish sons
that gave rise to this\nmarvelous communal ethos.
I'm referring to\nWinstanley, in fact,
because when I think\nof the diggers,
I immediately think of\nJohn Ball's rebellion.
And the rallying cry\nthere-- when Adam delved--
the diggers-- there was no\nsocial inequality at that time.
And here was this\nprelapsarian social justice,
but prior to the "sweat of the\nbrow" that you referred to.
And I'm just curious that--
I won't belabor this--\nbut a reluctance sometimes
to take on the core of\nJudeo-Christian values
that inform so much\nof this discourse.
I just put that out to you as\nan invitation to address that.
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's great.
And it is actually\nfrustrating to me,
as well, that environmentalists\nare so unwilling to engage
with religion.
And I think probably the\nmore work that I do--
and I'm just I'm just\nbeginning to really get
into 17th century history.
It's not my normal field.
The more reading I intend to do\non religious thinkers who would
have influenced Winstanley--
it's such a it's\nsuch complicated
question, especially here\nin the United States.
But if you're\ninterested, one book
that leaps to mind that\nmight be useful is--
I have a friend at Williams\nCollege named Nick Howe, who
just wrote a book\ncalled Landscapes
of the Secular, where he really\ngets into the question of,
what does it mean\nthat we commemorate,
that we have memorials in the\nform of crosses on hillsides
here in the United States?
Is that religious?
Is that a religious landscape?
Anyway, thank you.
I definitely take your point.
And I intend to follow up on it.
So this is actually related to\nreligion and environmentalism
in Cornell.
And that is in the\n1970s, there was
a religiously inspired movement\ncalled eco-justice at Cornell.
It started at\nSyracuse, apparently.
But I worked at Cornell\nin the late '70s.
And in 1978, we had\na eco-justice forum,
where I first met Murray\nBookchin in person
and got really into his things.
There's actually a\nbook that was published
with a collection of articles.
And you can find\nit on Google Play.
It's still available from\nSUNY Press in hardcover.
Wow, thank you.
I just looked it up.
I didn't know about it.
Yeah.
But it's very interesting,\nbecause it happened right
at Cornell.
And it involved, literally, the\nenvironmentalists associated
with Cornell-- they are academic\npeople who actually had got
their hands dirty on local\nenvironmental issues,
like the fact that\nthere was an attempt
to build a nuclear power plant\non Cayuga Lake because of all
the deep water which\nwas cold, to cool it,
and salt mines to store waste,\nand all sorts of things.
So these are people who\nare academics but also were
involved with local issues.
So I just wanted to get\nyou informed about that.
Everybody you talked\nabout are people
I've studied as I've gone back.
And as far as\nneighborhoods go, there's
one locally, which is the Oak\nHill neighborhood of Newton,
which was designed post-war,\nrather than pre-war
like the Sunnyside,\nto turn people inward,
has paths so kids don't\nhave to walk on streets.
And then going another\n100 years back,
there's the Brook Farm\ncommune in West Roxbury, which
was gender egalitarian,\nwhich was really rare in any
of these earlier attempts.
Yeah, thanks.
I'm sorry, that's a\nCambridge question.
That's good.
Well, I do have a question.
But I also wanted to\nmention in passing,
if you don't mind me saying\nso, you remind me Rod Serling.
You have the same kind of voice.
You even look a little like him.
But I don't know if we're in\nour own twilight zone here.
But I wanted to ask\nyou a question too.
But Winstanley notwithstanding,\nI'm still not clear,
even after all these centuries,\nwhy all human beings, even
if they are equal, have dominion\nover nature and over the Earth.
Shouldn't all species have\naccess to the commons?
Are we going to\ncontinue to privilege
the human species in its\nrelationship to the Earth,
regardless of their own\ninterspecies relationships?
Yeah, great question.
And I have to admit\nto being a humanist.
So I do, in fact,\nprivilege human beings.
At the same time, I think\nour idea of community
should be as expansive,\nand inclusive,
and capacious as possible.
And so yes, ideally,\nthere should be
room for all kinds of species.
I do think\nenvironmentalists have not
come to grips fully\nwith the simple fact
that we must use natural\nresources to survive.
The key question is\nhow we use them--
how carefully we use them.
So yeah, I acknowledge\nmy humanist bias.
I went into the\nhumanities for a reason.
Hi.
Where are we?
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Thanks for your talk.
I was just wondering\nhow you think
these white male American\ncommunity, or just communities
in privileged positions for\nwhom you seem to have framed
this history, can respectfully\nengage and support
marginalized or indigenous\ncommunities, who
have essentially, basically\nalways been practicing
environmental justice for\nlike thousands of years
in their communities, who\nactually do respectfully engage
with other species, and who\nare still constantly oppressed
today, even by modern\nenvironmental justice
movements.
I'm wondering,\nwhat are your ideas
about respectful engagement?
Yeah, so right now,\nmy favorite metaphor
for the kind of engagement that\nI think you're talking about
is friendship.
And that that would entail\na kind of mutual discourse
to discover the best ways\nof providing support.
Meanwhile, I think all\nprivileged communities,
like I suggested\nat the very end,
owe an incredible to\nthe rest of the world.
And it's absolutely time\nto start paying that.
All people of privilege\nshould be, in my opinion,
contributing whatever\nthey possibly can
to people who are\nright now experiencing
the horrible effects\nof climate change.
It really disturbs me when\nwe talk about the future
and what is going to happen\nto quote unquote "us," when
in fact, we've got lots and\nlots of examples of people who
are struggling with things that\nwere caused by what has gone on
in industrial countries.
Those industrial countries owe\nit to the rest of the world
to try to help with\nmoney, first and foremost.
A number of ethicists\nrecently have
published sort of\nsimple injunctions
to people in the\nindustrial world saying
like, we know that you feel that\ncontributing $20 to a nonprofit
is not really doing anything.
But in fact, if\neverybody did that,
it would mean a huge amount.
So please keep doing that.
So thanks.
I'm here.
It's fun to hear Murray\nBookchin mentioned years after.
I knew him also.
I knew him in New York.
He was an, as I remember him,\na very obnoxious character.
You probably never heard that.
And I would never have expected\nhis ideas, the written form,
anyway, to get the kind of\nattraction they seem to have,
which is interesting to me.
And I'm not against it.
I don't know if you know\nabout his daughter's work.
Have you by any chance--
depending on your\nlevel of interest,
his daughter is very involved\nwith an entity called the Left
Forum that happens\nevery spring in New York
and is very involved in a\ncommunity, in a Kurdish--
yeah, you know about that.
OK, so that's I\nguess an embodiment
of some of Murray's ideas\naccording to some people,
perhaps.
I don't know.
As an aside, I\nremember advertisements
in the subway in New York--
"If everybody would just\nbe a little less greedy."
And I always thought\nto myself, yeah,
here I am riding the subway.
Why don't you tell\nthat to the people
in the limousines, and the\ncabs, and the privileged people?
So I want to mention that\nin terms of the that's owed,
it's differentially owed.
We don't all owe the\nsame level of debt.
We didn't all incur the same.
We're not all\nequally responsible.
So I just want to\nmake that observation
if you care to elaborate on it.
But I'm always\nwondering, when you
hear this story about\nthe diggers and stories
like that, how was it that\nwhat one might have thought
would have been a majority\nof the population,
were not able to\nprevail over the 1%--
or whatever the percent\nwas at the time.
The lords of the manor\nwere presumably a minority.
How are the lords of the manor\nable to mobilize enough support
from the rest of us\nto suppress those
who resist the\nprivatization of the common?
They seem to be able to do it\nquite well all the time, even
here in Cambridge.
Well, I think it's about power.
But about the\ndifferential debt--
of course I agree\nwith you on that.
That's why I phrased\nit the way I did--
"The more you\'ve benefited\nfrom a stable climate,
the more you know."
but yeah, the lords had\na huge amount of power.
Thank you for a\nwonderful talk, which
resonates with a lot that\ngoes on in this school.
I want to go to the late middle\nof your historical brackets--
so second half of\nthe 19th century.
And I couldn't stop thinking\nabout the displacement
of African-Americans in the\nproject of the Central Park
in New York--
so the Seneca Village issue.
And maybe it's unanswerable,\ncertainly unreconcilable,
because this is not a\nproject of capitalism,
nor of colonialism,\nbut one of democracy.
Well this is where I thought\nyou might lend a hand.
Albert [? fein, ?] 30 or 40\nyears ago, would have said,
this is the greatest expression\nof the American democracy
in physical form,\nor physical terms.
Ethan Carr might say, the\ngreatest American work of art.
And yet, we have\nenormous contradiction.
I just wonder how\nyou reflect on that.
Yeah.
Thank you for the question.
And it's a tough one.
I think probably many\nof us in this room
really want to\nlove Central Park.
And I certainly do.
But it would be hard\nto make an argument
that any kind of development\nin the 19th century
was not about capitalism\nand colonialism.
Those people living in\nSeneca village had no chance.
And the people really driving\nCentral Park were elites.
And as I'm sure you\nknow, some geographers
have even made the\nargument that part
of the rationale for\nbuilding Central Park
was just to bring\nproperty values up.
So it's always complicated.
I do think Central Park is a\ngreat democratic institution.
And some of the motivation\nbehind it was democratic.
But some of it was\nalso capitalistic.
And that image of\nthe removal of people
is one I think we should\nall try to keep in our minds
as something that has always\nhappened in the last 400 years.
And I try to be hopeful in\nthe kind of history that I do.
And I try to emphasize\npositive examples that
can be of use to people today.
But I also sometimes think\nabout the last 400 years
as one extended land grab.
Unfortunately, there's\na lot of evidence
to support that kind\nof characterization.
I was wondering whether you\ncould elaborate even further
on your ideas about how humanity\nscholars, humanists, historians
can contribute effectively to\nmaking maybe policy changes
or shaping the\nenvironment at large.
Yeah, thanks.
Now I think the realm of\nculture is always up for grabs.
And many humanists\nspecifically, work on culture.
I'm struggling with this\nquestion a little bit,
because I know\nthat in this case,
it was asked from a very\nsympathetic perspective.
But I've often\nanswered the question,
when asked by scientists,\nwho are saying, basically,
who are you, and what\ncan you contribute?
We've got the\ntechnological solutions.
And the thing that\nI usually say--
and I hope this doesn't\ncome across as defensive--
is that it's\ninteresting, isn't it,
that we've had technological\nsolutions for a long time?
And the problem has\nbeen implementing them.
The problem has been\nmindsets and political will.
And we in the\nhumanities, I think,
are pretty well\npositioned, depending
on how we choose to\ncommunicate, to get
people to reconsider their\nassumptions, their mindsets.
And I think there is some\npower and influence there.
I hope there is.
It's surprising what\nhappens in our culture.
It's when those of us who\ncare about these things
sometimes have a\ntendency to get really,
really frantically upset\nwhen something happens,
like the Trump election,\nmyself included.
But I think one nice thing\nabout the humanities in general,
and, history in particular\nis is that it helps you
step back and gain perspective.
And when many of my\ncolleagues have told me
they assume that Trump must be\nthe worst president ever in US
history, I'll say like,\nwell, let me tell you
about James K. Polk.
It's always possible\nto think differently.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thinking about the tool to\nmake people feel responsible
and to act responsible\ntowards the environment,
I'm going to ask you\nthe question, where
do we need to start to create\nthis human-responsibility list?
Should we go to the United\nNations organization level
and create something like, in\nparallel with human rights?
In my opinion, we are\nlike mist to create
from the very beginning,\nlike to parts of human rights
and human responsibility.
Yeah, so where is the\nstarting point you see?
And to what extent\nwe should go further
to feel responsibility\nand tale responsibility
toward the environment.
Yeah, thanks.
I think for me, the most\ninteresting scholars working
on environmental justice today\nare emphasizing that it's
a multi-scaler problem.
So the interventions\nthat we can make
have to happen at the very\nlocal neighborhood level.
They have to happen at the\nregional level, the state
level, the nation level, the\ninternational-community level.
And it has to be in many\ndifferent disciplines
and arenas--
not just culture, but\nalso law, for instance,
et cetera, et cetera.
So I don't have any\nway of prioritizing
one kind of intervention.
But I just would\nemphasize that it
has to happen at all of\nthose different scales.
And one can also then\nsay, well anything
I do even at the local\nlevel is a contribution.
I do believe what I said about\nthe creation more and more
common spaces, where people\nfeel the need to care
for them as a community.
I think that that\ncreates a powerful sense
of responsibility.
The most obvious\none for me right now
is the community garden,\nwhich is becoming really,
an incredible trend, especially\nin large post-industrial cities
around this country.
Urban gardening, urban farming\nare really important now.
And I think those\nare great movements.
Hi.
Just talking more\nabout common spaces,
could you give some like\nexamples or best practices,
in terms of implementing\nor how common spaces have
been implemented or introduced\nto cities, municipalities,
and moving forward, like\nhow we can try and make
that more of a\npriority, I guess?
I don't have any more examples\noff the top of my head
than the ones I've\nalready talked about.
But I will just say that\nespecially in Elinor Ostrum's
work, the economist who debunked\nthe tragedy of the commons,
the key point is that there\nhas to be a communal system
of management for the commons.
In other words, everybody\nhas to buy in and participate
in the development of\nvarious kinds of regulations.
So for any kind of common\nspace, the corollary
is political participation.
That's a must.
That's one of the\nkeys to anything
we might wind up calling\nenvironmental justice.
Thank you so much, Aaron.
