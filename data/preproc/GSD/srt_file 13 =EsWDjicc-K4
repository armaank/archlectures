Good evening and welcome.
Thank you all very\nmuch for being
here on this wonderful\nMonday evening so close
to the reviews and the\nend of the semester.
So we're really appreciative.
It's an incredible treat to be\nable to have Peter Markli here
with us tonight.
And I think it's even\na very special honor
that Peter is here\nwith his family,
Elisabeth and Anna, that\nhave come from Zurich.
I've been trying to get\nPeter to come and give
a talk for a few years.
And it's really wonderful\nthat he is here.
I could say a lot\nabout him, and I won't.
But we have been friends\nand collaborating.
And it was a\nwonderful thing for me
to be able to work\nwith Peter on his book,
his first book for\npublication called
Approximations, which happened\nnow about 15 or 16 years ago.
And I think it took\nus quite some time
to get to the point\nof having the book.
And of course since then,\nwe've had many other encounters
and conversations about\nother projects, which we also
hope that there would be\nsome other publications that
will be happening.
In addition to that book\nApproximations, Peter has also
had a number of\nrecent publications,
one on drawings and another\nmonograph about his work
called Everything\none invents is true,
which was published\nlast year and is,
in a sense, a sort of companion\npublication to the book
Approximations that\nwas done in 2002.
Why call the book\nApproximations?
And in a way, in short,\npart of the reason
is because the way in\nwhich Peter Markli works
is always, in a sense, trying\nto approach some version, if you
like, of the concept of\nthe ideal, of ideality,
and deliberately\nnot achieving it,
not to try and do things\nthat essentially are perfect.
So the concept of approximating\nthe ideal and the notion
of approximation itself was\na very important, in a way,
phenomenon to use as a\nreference point for the book.
The other thing that will\nprobably become quite apparent
in the presentation is that\nfrom the very beginning,
from the very beginning\nof his training, thinking,
and practice, Peter\nhas had a number
of very specific reference\npoints, where he lived,
where he studied,\nwho he studied with.
And I think from that early\nstage, two figures, one Rudolf
Olgiati, the father of Valerio\nOlgiati that many of you know,
and a sculptor called Hans\nJosephsohn that he will show
were, in a sense, two reference\npoints between architecture
and sculpture.
And the materiality of the\nwork of Hans Josephsohn
is obviously a very important\npresence in his work.
The other thing is really the\nconstant reference to history
and the way in which history\nis very present in the project
of contemporary architecture.
And this is something\nthat many of us
have been discussing about\nthe relevance of history
and the manner in\nwhich we might be
able to refer or utilize or\nmake history something that
is present.
But it's very difficult to speak\nabout those things and for you
to imagine Peter's practice as\nsomething which in some form
or fashion is conventional,\nbecause it isn't.
I think that his\npractice is very
unconventional by\ncontemporary standards.
And I want to just read\nyou a few lines from--
because I was just\ngoing through the book
that we did and I did in 2002--
and just for you to\ncapture something
of the method or work.
Because Peter basically\nworks by himself,
even though he has\nan office, which
is an office that realizes\nhis work and his production.
But he himself works alone.
So in the context\nof an institution,
when someone like me constantly\ntalks about collaboration,
he is someone who is\nreally, in some ways,
very much working as an artist\nin a studio producing work,
not in constant\ncommunication with others.
So maybe these few lines\nwill give you a sense.
It's a longer piece,\nso I won't read it.
But just because this\nis the way that the book
Approximation starts\nabout Peter's work.
It starts with a quote\nfrom Paul Cezanne
to Charles Camoin in\n1902 where he says,
"I have little to tell you.
Indeed one says more\nand perhaps better
things about painting when\nfacing the motive than when
discussing purely speculative\ntheories, in which, as often
as not, one loses oneself."
Like Cezanne, Peter\nMarkli also believes
that one can say better\nthings about one's work
when facing it,\naddressing it directly.
Perhaps that is why despite a\nhighly articulate formulation
of his ideas, he\nhas spoken little
during a 20-year\nprofessional career that
has produced some apparently\nsimple yet remarkable
buildings.
Even by the usually reticent\nstandards of Swiss architects,
Markli has been more\nself-reflective than most.
He spends long periods\nthinking through every aspect
of his projects from\ninception to realization,
yet he has not previously\ndocumented his work
in a systematic fashion.
This publication will\nhopefully go some way
towards remedying that\nintentional neglect.
In many respects, Markli\nworks in self-imposed exile
from the normal conventions\nof running a practice.
He works alone, and\nthe studio where
he spends most of the time\ndeveloping the initial drawings
and models for projects is in\nan anonymous, rundown, courtyard
building close to the\nperiphery of Zurich.
That's how it used to be.
That area has become\nmuch more fashionable
now in Zurich, so in\nthe last 15 years.
But I'm saying these\nthings just for you
to get a flavor of the\ncircumstance, the environment,
the kind of conditions that\nan architect uses in order
to find the productive\nconditions for his work
and the way in which he\noscillates constantly
between drawing in\na very direct way
and how those drawings\nthen become really
part of the material\nof a building,
an office building, an\ninstitutional building, and so
on.
It's a really incredible\ndedication and devotion
to architectural practice.
There's a lot more to\nsay, but we should really
hear from Peter Markli.
And as you know, we have\nsomeone in San Francisco
who's doing this simultaneous\ntranslation for us.
It's a first for us.
So with best wishes\nto Peter Markli,
would you please welcome Peter.
Thank you.
[applause]
[speaking german]
I welcome you cordially\nto this presentation.
My profession was art of\nbuildings, which means
that that became my language.
Art of building means that\nwith your profession--
that is, the art of\nbuilding, but there are also
painters, moviemakers,\nwriters, and so on--
that you try to express\nyour view of the world
with your products,\nwith your buildings.
This is a very early\nbuilding of mine.
You can see it's a\nduplex residential house.
I was very young at the time.
I did have a language, but the\nlanguage was still very limited
because I was young.
But I didn't have a small,\nlimited feeling, emotion.
The emotion is there.
You don't need an education.
My passion was\ngreat at this time.
And passion, emotion, and\nlanguage were still limited.
And that was the building\nthat I built for two families.
And what I always was interested\nin was that the building has
a mood, that it\nexudes something,
has an appeal which can give\nthe people some kind of dignity.
This is the meaning of our\nprofession, the purpose
of our profession, whether\nit's a single building
or urban planning project.
The floorplan of the two-family.
And here you see these circular\nelements which, for example,
my students left out.
But these are so-called columns.
And when architects today\nleave out the columns,
it's legitimate,\nbut they will have
to be able to explain exactly\nwhy they are omitting them.
And the column,\nin our profession,
was the most expensive element\nthat you could possibly have.
And they have to take\nresponsibility if they leave
linguistic or language elements\nin the art of the building out
or if they retrieve them,\nbecause some elements need
to be retrieved, because the\nclassical modern age cannot
represent the entire\nfuture to come.
But classical modernism has\nto be reviewed critically.
Next slide, please.
The next, please.
[speaking german]
In the middle, you'll\nfind this two-story hall.
Then you have the\ninterior of one.
Next, please.
[speaking german]
And a photograph of the outside.
You can see there is\na little door frame.
And I would like to explain\nto you with these three
photographs how I arrived\nat this type of design.
I was there visiting.
And we mostly\ndiscussed this area
that I pointed out\nin that building.
This is a place where\nmuch was invested in.
And Rudolf Olgiati has\nbuilt in these areas
where they had these\narchaic columns.
And about the\nchapter structure, he
said that there needed to\nbe an intermediate space
between the columns\nand what is behind.
So it's floating\nover the columns.
And every chapter structure\nthat has been built
has this same function.
It's an architectural\nelement that
will always produce shadow.
And if a leaf is shown\non the chapter structure,
then it is the element in a tree\nthat can carry the least load.
So building does not always\nmean to show how heavy a load is
but to try to abstract from\nthe load to dematerialize.
And this is what\nI was using here.
This model from Rudolf Olgiati.
And the general model was\nthis Roman-style church.
And you see that elements\nwere taken from there.
And together with the columns,\nit has gotten this design.
It was said at the outset that\nI got to know the sculptor Hans
Josephsohn during my studies.
And at that time, big\nmuseums were built in Paris,
for example.
And we had these\nfantastic discussions
that we could actually make\na building, one specifically
designed for his\nworks in Switzerland.
And this was then\nimplemented in Ticino.
In the north, you have the Alps.
And in the south, to the south,\nyou have the Gotthard line.
So this is a very small\nplace with a very nice
Romance-style church.
And the building is set in the\nsituation between the river
there.
Next, please.
And the structure\nof the building,
the shape of the\nbuilding is such
that you see the traces of work.
These are side views here.
And these sculptures were\nsuitable for being lined up
in rows.
We selected two types\nof sculptures, reliefs
and semi-sculptures.
And we needed space\naround these sculptures.
Height was not the most\ndecisive element here.
And as I said\nbefore, this building
was designed specifically\nfor these sculptures.
And what I understand\nby the art of building
is actually expressed\nin this area.
The idea is the side\nview of the building.
And the question\nwhen working on it
was, can this narrow\nlower part cooperate--
can two parts cooperate to\ncreate a joint impression?
So these are traces of work.
It's the same thing as\nwhen a writer starts
to delete something.
You see the variations here.
Art of building means\nyou have an idea,
but that does not\nmean that you also
are looking through\nvariants that
might be totally different,\nthat you study variations.
And this is how it\nwas eventually built.
So there was a little recess\nbuilt in through which incident
light comes in.
So light from the top\nasymmetrically placed.
This is the ground plan,\na very simple plan.
For me, the question\nalways is, what do you
understand by imagination?
What do you understand\nby language?
Architecture is a language.
There are conventions\nbetween people
to be able to communicate.
Or is language\nprivatized in a manner so
that the next person\nwill not understand it?
The art of building\nis developed in a way
that you definitely\nhave to create
a relationship with the past.
There has to be a\nconnection to the past.
You cannot reinvent\nor invent yourself.
And what you do must\nappear fresh and novel
in terms of current conditions\nbut not detached from our past,
from what has been there before.
So we look into the past\nand rebuild the future.
So you have to decide for\nyourself how much you allow
of that to get into your work.
So the ground floor\nis really very simple.
You have these various chambers.
And you have a general\nrectangular long stretch
with two doors in the middle.
And these are the spaces\nin which these sculptures
were exhibited.
And this is the only\nspace, so the doors
are of the same length.
And the asymmetrical is\ndepending on the situation.
So the access door is facing\naway from the village.
You will see that later.
If that was a\nsupermarket, the door
would be on the other side.
And the spatial can show\nyou what my question always
is when we discuss\nabout the language
of the art of building.
If I personally walk around a\nbuilding by, say, Frank Gehry,
does it have various\ndifferent sides?
Or are these sides all uniform?
And does this overall plan\nhave more varied sides
than the building by Gehry?
The other question is--
and I'm saying that because I\nhave traveled from far away--
if I explain a language\nas the constructs--
I'm interested like\nthe deconstructivists
in things like build\nhorizontally or not
build horizontally.
And language, of\ncourse, is not complete.
If I have to build horizontally\nfor various reasons,
I can leave the language.
And I have not met yet\nany deconstructivist
who would want to eat his food\nfrom a table that is askance.
And these are the\nquestions that you
have to ask young people\nfrom all the offers
that are available today.
What is the language\nyou wish to speak?
The sectional view,\ndifferent room heights.
And this is how you approach\nthe building from the village.
You have the top light there.
There's just a transparent\nplate with Japanese films.
It lets diffused light into the\nbuilding and no shadows at all.
Here you see this\nsmall entrance.
You have to get the key\ndown from the village,
and then you can enter\nthe museum there.
Can you go back one?
One, one.
Yeah.
[speaking german]
So that was the drawing.
And this idea is not far away\nfrom what was eventually built.
These are early\nworks by Josephsohn
created in the 1950s.
In inverted commas,\nabstract reliefs, then
the deep space with\nthese plastic reliefs,
this row of plastic reliefs.
And here is the room\nwith the sculptures.
They have to be away from\nthe wall and be on pedestals.
So the spatial\nreaction is important.
Here it was a real\nexperiment, because there
was no comparable building.
So this is a fairly narrow room.
Usually if you try to\nplace such sculptures,
you will make the room wider.
And what we wanted was that the\nsculptures speak for themselves
and are not arranged\nwithin a space.
These small chambers for\ndoing a 90-degree movement.
It's a very rough concrete.
And we then got a contract\nto build new headquarters
building for Synthes company\non a former military premises.
And this building is used\nto produce surgical parts
for all the bone fractures, like\nscrews and other parts needed
to heal fractures.
This is the former barracks, the\nmilitary object that was here.
This first building is protected\nunder the Monument Act.
The urban planning\nsituation is it's
close to a river outside\nof the city of Solothurn.
We designed this\nbuilding in connection
with the Baroque city.
This long building and\nthe arsenal were taken,
and between the two,\na space was created.
The contractor wanted an\nunderground parking space
there.
And we said, you\ncannot do that here.
We wanted to have\nthe parking space
out here so that the\nlongitudinal building,
this oblong building,\ngets a specific design.
We included parking decks\nand extended the arsenal
with these parking decks.
So the entire area\nwas usually thought
to be meant for the public.
These are the sketches we made.
This is the top view.
They are different from the\ndrawings, because the drawings,
they look into the\nlanguage, into the design
of the building,\nand these sketches,
they capture such\ndifferent things,
like the positioning,\nthis urban planning
situation, the way the building\nlooks in its environment.
And that was the\ncenterpoint first.
And step by step, it was\nmoved closer towards the river
to create an urban space\nbetween the arsenal
and the new building.
And a large part of my work,\nwhich I love very much,
is the search for an idea\nof a given spatial program
that we translate\nor have to transcend
into what later will--
yes, of course, will\nfill the functions,
but which also has a mood\nthat it reaches human beings,
the soul of human beings.
So these sketches,\nthese ideas are always
made on smaller sheets\nof paper, A4 letter size.
You see the arsenal here\nagain, the parking decks,
and this vertical element\nof the new building
and the driveway and the river.
This is very economical as\nfar as cost is concerned.
And I recommend that\nyou never forget
about all these\noffers that today
that you need to draw\nall by hand still.
Economical means you can carry\nit with you in your pocket.
You can take it out in a cafe.
And art in general is highly\neconomical and efficient.
It is very important\nto say different things
with one and same element.
If a building has\nsuperfluous parts,
then it's no longer\nart of the building.
We have to look to what we\nneed to express our feelings
and everything that\nis too much has
to be found and be left out.
And that is the great art.
It is not great\nart to overdo it.
To know what precisely expresses\nmy abilities, current abilities
in the moment, and what\nexpresses the program,
that is decisive.
Here again you have a ground\nfloor plan of the arsenal.
You see a high roof and\nthese super verticals.
So this is now a project drawing\nof the arsenal with the parking
decks in the back.
It was applied stones.
It's the same stones used to\nbuild the Baroque city center.
And also the new\nbuilding has parts
of this typical material\nof the town, together
with other materials, of course.
A sectional view here.
And then these wonderful--
for me-- wonderful works\nwhere you just have dots,
nothing but dots.
And these dots sometimes can\nmean an architectural element
or a tree.
And when you look\nthrough it in diagonal,
these incredibly complex\nstructures are developed.
This is the ground\nfloor of that building.
Here we have the\nparking structure.
So the ground floor\nis structured such
that it has an\nentrance into the yard.
This is a\nrepresentative entrance.
There is not a single\nseparation between these spaces.
It's just the way in which\nthe materials or stairs that
were used inside, you\ncan see that you either
come from one side to\nthe other or vice versa.
There's a formal\nhall, a lecture hall.
Yeah, this is the\nlecture hall here.
A room for practical\nexercises and the workshop.
So this is asymmetrically\nstyled along the river.
In the upper stories,\nwe propose that this
is the actual communication\nsurface, communication area.
So you can create individual\noffice spaces up there.
How do you arrive at the design?
I think that's the\nstory of our profession
is that you prepare\nfor every day,
and then you have some sort of\na vocabulary on which you can
build and process a project.
This is a very small sketch.
But this sketch is\nvery important for me,
because sketches can make\nthings that are of iron cast.
If you draw them 100 times,\nno longer that iron cast.
And the same we\nfind in mathematics,
if you know an equation, you\ncan derive others from it.
And if you do not know the\nequation and only a derivation,
it is possible to\ndiscover some way that
hasn't been seen before.
And these sketches\nare exactly the same.
You have these clusters\nhere, and they've
coincided in one point\nfrom the vertical elements.
And I made several sketches.
Once again, you see\nthe chapter structure
is in the horizontal plane.
It starts with a\nsmall relief here.
And it optically guides\nthe eye very strongly
into this horizontal play.
And afterward, you find\nnodes between elements.
Here is everything in\nthe horizontal plane.
And we submitted this\nsheet for a competition.
You see the ancient architects\nlooked at it this way.
You have the column.
You have the\nsuperstructure reliefs.
And we took all that that you\nsee on the left-hand side,
and it was summarized\nin this node here.
And this is the consequence\nof these drawings.
The element in this building,\nthe vertical element,
it was then split\nup and the node.
These are the parking decks.
And if everything gets\nthese stone applications,
then it will be more expensive.
And so we just applied\nthem here and there.
And these interspaces\nemerged because they
wanted to have a joint here.
And so we left a\nlarge interspace.
The material from\nthis arsenal and then
applied to this other\nstructure, applied
to this concrete structure.
And you see the pavement there.
It is cobblestoned.
You see the columns\nhere at some spacing.
The new building is in\nthis big landscape area,
so the spans are enormous.
And what we thought is\nthe so-called facade
is not that alone, but in\ncombination with this part.
And this basically makes\nup the general appearance.
And so it's bound back with\nthe help of this node there.
Whether this is a residue\nof a classic socket
is a different question.
And in this portion,\nwe address the scale
of the people that are\nmoving about in here.
These pillars were painted\nwith a color of white
so that the gray color\ncan shine through.
Next, please.
Next, please
[speaking german]
Here you see these nodes again\nmoving all the way to the top.
This is the entrance hall\nwith the main staircase
on this side, very lofty\nand a very bright atrium.
And then these\ncorner rooms, where
you have a number of\nrooms to hold meetings in.
And I was not just an architect.
I had also friends\nwho were artists.
I knew painting.
I knew sculptures.
And I had no difficulty to\nwork with these new conditions
in architecture, because I\nhad very many language options
that I discovered in\narchitecture from painting
and from sculpturing,\nsculpturing as far as joining
things and as far as\npainting is concerned,
this wall, for example.
Only half of the material\nis on a gray priming.
This is the portion\nwhere the workshop is.
This table and the workshop,\neverything is open.
And then we have\ncurtains as part
of art elements in the building.
Various students had\nproject proposals,
and these are what they proposed\nfor these spatial curtains
built like tubes.
The lecture hall.
Once again, curtains and rods.
And the informal lecture\nhall, where you come in.
You find the textile\nmaterial here,
a leather, incorporated here.
The offices.
And here you have a\nview of the interspace.
Back, the view towards\nthis Baroque city.
And the view towards the river.
It's a column building.
And now we are coming\nto a studio house.
We were asked to build\nit by two musicians.
And they were talking about a\nspatial program, a house where
the workplace formed the center\nof the house and the rooms
that you would normally\ncall your living rooms
were organized\npractically like the crust
of a bread around the studio.
This is the situation.
Very modest buildings,\nvery beautiful landscape.
This is sketch showing the\nheight lines, the entrance.
And number one\nwould be the studio.
Another sketch of\nhow you approach
this structure and the facade\nfor this entrance situation.
And in this section, you can\nsee it was important to me
that the roof did not have\nexactly the same inclination
as the slope had but went\ninto the same direction.
And then there is a basement\nonly here in the front.
Otherwise, we would have to\ndig out material at the back.
And the side facing the\nvalley is open, very open
with these layered, fragmented\nwalls that create shadows.
So the actually surrounding\nwall that goes around here
is not repeated in\nthe upper story,
because that would\nhave a dramatic effect.
This is a ground floor plan.
There's a very small\ncurvature here.
And the entrance goes directly\ninto the studio, or this way.
Here is a narrow room,\nliving room and kitchen.
And upstairs, where you have a\nbathroom, a toilet, very narrow
rooms for the children.
And it was built in this\nmanner and integrated.
It fits into this landscape.
And you can see\nthese layered walls.
Otherwise, it looks very much\nlike a conventional building.
So what we [inaudible]\nhere most of all
is this wall that\nfaces the valley.
You see a very big gutter,\nand the wooden structures
between these concrete\nwall elements.
This is the building where\nthe people lived in--
had a budget.
The budget has nothing\nto do, in my view,
with the art of the building.
The question is if an architect\ncan handle a budget or not.
If you have a smaller budget,\nthat doesn't mean you cannot
create any art, and it doesn't\nautomatically mean that
the spaces have to be small.
But the main topic is the people\nin Switzerland, [inaudible]
people in Switzerland,\nhave this idea.
And what I know, that for\nsome of them, the toilet
bowl or a golden\nwater tap is more
important than the actual space.
But these owners of the building\nwere very open to any ideas.
And I made a drawing of the\nhouse and met with the owners.
And then it was too\nexpensive for them.
And then we just sat\ntogether at the table
and talked about places\nwhere we can save money.
And we did not give up\nany square foot of space.
So it's a bituminous roof.
It has electrical bottom.
And the walls were protected\nbecause they were not--
they're just walls, not visible,\nand painted a little bit.
And we used a type\nof insulation called
foam glass, which is black.
And we left these black parts\nof the insulation deliberately
visible.
So we have bricks, white\ncollar, red outlets,
and black insulation.
This is the kitchen.
It is mobile, so you\ncan move it around.
This is a gas range and oven.
The bricks here are painted\nup to a certain height,
also not all the way down.
And you see the wall\nis a little rougher,
and the gray color\nshines through.
The gray from the concrete\ncan be an element,
and the red of the brick\ncan be part of the design,
and the black of the insulation\ncan be part of the design.
So all together, if it works,\nis essential and very beautiful
house built with very\nsimple materials.
And another building\ncan be as beautiful
using more exclusive materials.
And both can have the\nsame level of art in them.
Here you see the\nfurnishings, a floor lamp
and various instruments,\na big table, a fireplace.
Working and living area\ncompletely unified.
There's the insulation.
And they happen to have\na closet like that.
The shower and bathroom.
And so this light up there,\nwe made a frame, a white frame
so that we could put\nthe electric cable down.
And we knew we would make\nthis type of framework.
So this is the\ngeneral light, not
the vanity light or intimate\nlight that you sometimes also
have in a bathroom.
Next is the film, please
[speaking german]
For the first time in my life,\nI had a video camera in my hand
and did something.
And an employee of mine\nactually made it visible
what I did there.
[music playing]
And put music to it.
That was the [inaudible].
[music playing]
And then we had dinner in there\ntogether with the musicians.
The last person you\nsaw is the composer.
Many thanks for your attention.
[applause]
I hope you have some\nquestions for Peter.
There's so many issues that\nare raised in the work.
And I'd rather we devote\nthe time to your questions.
I'm always happy,\nas you know, to be
the person asking questions.
We already have a hand out here.
Could we get a mike here?
And you can use--
This?
Yeah.
Thank you so much\nfor the lecture.
Can you hear in German?
I have a few questions\nabout your relationship
with Hans Josephsohn.
Wait, wait, [inaudible].
So one of the work\nthat you showed,
the museum for his sculpture,\nthe proportion to me,
the sculpture, the\nproportion of sculpture
inside of the building--
the proportion of the\nbuilding, they somehow
match together very perfectly.
But because the works,\nthe sculptures are old,
they're not going to shrink--
but I wonder if you would\nhave another museum for him
of relatively new\nworks and the works
are going to shrink, I\nassume, then how do you--
I'm just curious how important\nthe dimension of the sculpture
is to your building.
And if the sculpture shrinks,\nthen would you be irritated?
[music playing]
I'm sorry.
First of all, these\nsculptures can be exchanged,
can be moved around.
The second is its typologies.
And the typologies range\nfrom 1950 to the year 2000.
So there are reliefs from the\n1950s and reliefs from 2000.
The third, the building, the\nentire structure and campus,
is the most favorable house\nyou can see for 40 sculptures.
The question is if\nit's effective or not.
And if it is effective.
Now I know, well, I was\nabout 30 years old back then.
Then I today don't know if\nI had another opportunity
to create a place for this\nsculptor Josephsohn, what
this would look like.
I have no idea.
But I do have ideas to\nanswer your question
how I would build museums.
But we all lose\nthese competitions
when we propose these, because\nthey are nonconformist.
And you will actually\nmake a statement
what is decisive and\nimportant for the future.
And if you talk about\nart, art basically
belongs to the people.
And I am asking myself, I'm\nwondering why all our museums
are so bunker-like,\nwhy they are--
I know about insurance\nissues and this and that.
But one could\ncreate a more open,
or at least the appearance of\na more open and more inviting
design.
And I find it quite\nquestionable how
they're designed\ntowards the outside,
towards the audience,\nthe visitors.
I would be very interested\nto exhibit [inaudible] where
a farmer goes by with his truck.
And I have made this proposal,\nbut it was not accepted.
And once again, Alberto\nGiacometti would also be great.
So there's many great things.
But if I ever were to build\nsomething again for Josephsohn,
I think I would be most\nintrigued by needing
even less money but be as good.
That would be my incitement\nfor the next project.
And with these\nbronze sculptures,
it's not difficult with\nthe air of the climate
in the room, the air\nconditioning of the room.
It is the humidity that\nis damaging to paintings.
If you have low humidity, you\nsee paintings in old buildings
and churches that survive.
What I didn't quite understand\nis what you're shrinking,
but you-- plastics?
If you reduce the scale.
So the art is dependent\non the scale, right?
So not shrinking.
But if Josephsohn's\nsculptures are very big,
if you were dealing\nwith sculpture that was
smaller-scale, would the scale\nof art and the architecture--
OK, yeah.
That's not the\nquestion of the size,
never, never, because\nif you will give me
a sculpture like\nthat, I will build
you a sock, enormous sock, that\nthe sculpture became very big.
And you can [german].
And you can save a lot\nof money in doing so.
[laughter]
And if Josephsohn had very\nlarge or very tall sculptures--
but this is a theoretical\nquestion which you actually
are not allowed to ask,\nbecause if you see his reliefs
and his references\nto human figure,
his sculptures are just barely\nlarger than a regular human
being would be.
I don't know.
I cannot imagine if he had\nmade monumental works of art.
It's simply-- but\nas an architect,
I could also accommodate\na very large sculpture.
Please.
Hello.
I would like to\nask you in the way
that history is important\nto you in context, as we
saw in your lecture, how do\nyou go about using history
and not fall in the trap of\nusing it just as an image
but actually as the very\ncomplex thing that it is?
How do you use the essence\nof history in your project?
Thank you.
[speaking german]
We have an advantage\ncompared to art historians.
We have to perceive\nhistory with our eyes
and not by reading books.
We are not bound\nto a chronology,
but we are required.
For our question, our things\nwe need in the present,
we have to look into the past\nto find potential answers.
And art always means to build\non previous art, previous work,
and to transform it into\npresent-day and future
meanings.
That is the process.
And because our present\nin social matters
as well as in building\nphysical matters
has completely new\nissues and questions,
it is impossible to\nbuild in a retro style,
because we have\ncompletely new questions
that we need to answer.
And if you take these\nseriously, every time
has two, three very\nimportant issues
which are answered in\na sovereign manner when
you accept the content\nof these issues as issues
and do not create\nreadymade sculptures
and transport them\ninto the present.
Form has to find itself\nin a new way every time.
Otherwise, it is not\ntopical, not current.
If you have the\nAmerican Expressionists,
there's no need to paint\nthem a second time,
because the very\nspecific conditions they
had to get to their works.
Do you know the article\nBarnett Newman in 1948
that he wrote in The Nation?
It's very beautiful\nhow he worded it.
I don't even know\nif I can get it
right from the top of my head.
You want me to quote him?
He said, based on the historical\nsituation where he was
and where the Europeans were,\nhe also knew European art very
well, that the Europeans\nalways stick to the motive
and the subject and\ncannot get away from it,
not even Mondrian.
And the Europeans\nwere capable of taking
these subjects and to transcend\nthem into a spiritual world.
The American Expressionists had\ntaken pure ideas, no subject,
no topic, just a pure idea.
And if it comes to transcending\nthat into a spiritual world,
they can transcend\ntheir abstract the world
into a very real and\nperceivable world.
And you as an architect always\nhave a job, a program, that is,
always try certain parameters.
And you have to\njust take it as it
is without whining\nabout the budget
or because there\nwere parasites there
and there are these\nproblems, those problems
with the electricity and\nbecause the craftsmen don't
know what they're doing.
Stop whining about\nall these issues.
If you want to be an architect,\ntake this dry program
and translate it into an\nemotional, perceivable world.
That is your job,\nsimply speaking.
And that's how you\nfind your language.
This means we have a\nsubjective choice from history.
Egypt, Renaissance, many\nthousands of years back,
Renaissance, 500 years back,\nare much more current for me--
I could talk about\nit for two hours--
than the classical modernism is.
I find much more material for\nanswering our today's questions
back there.
Thank you for your lecture.
I was hoping that you could\nexpand a bit upon the way
that materiality\nand budget, what
you spoke about both multiple\ntimes in the lecture,
both inform the\nway that you design
and how you approach a project.
[speaking german]
I can only talk\nabout it in this way
because I can only work when\nI am happy and work with joy.
That the creation of\nmaterial basically
is not the first one in the\nhierarchy, hierarchy up there.
The urban planning\nanswer in conjunction
with a program,\nthat is at the top.
And these decisions are\nmade at an artistic level,
but equivalent to that is a\npolitically active person as
well.
And if you don't know anything\nabout life and are not
politically engaged, you will\nnot be able to create potential
beauty, because beauty cannot\nbe consumed like a piece of pie.
And what motivates me is beauty.
And I keep thinking, oh, I would\nlike to be able to do that.
This means I have an idea,\nan urban planning concept,
a spatial structure\nthat comes together
without a surroundings,\nand then I have a budget.
And if the principle\nlets me select materials,
and it's not even many, it's\nthe same to me, as beautiful
as something else.
So first, something\nhas to be created.
An idea has to come.
And the idea does not\ncome through the material,
but the urban planning situation\nand the spatial situation.
When you have an idea, it is\nsmall without any variation.
But when you start\nworking on it,
it's like a character\nin a novel, that
right of determined, but\nit gets its own life.
You cannot see all\nits traits yet.
But then in the history\nthat is playing out,
the character in the novel must\nadd new traits of character.
And we have to work in constant\ncommunication with our plan.
And the more we\nhave on this plan,
the more it speaks to you.
And it's important to me that--
and you apply two things at the\nsame level, the being in love
with your plan and an\nincredible distance to it
that does not make you a\nslave of your plan, that
lets you look at it from afar\nand see something like, wait,
you have to move in this\ndirection or in that.
And as far as a plan has\ndeveloped, the less free
you will be.
You will have to\ncommunicate on the way.
This is the most\nimportant thing.
And then you discover the\nmore and more you work on it,
you find ways and\ndirections where to go.
And unless you just\nhave an ideology
or pattern, rigid\npattern how to build,
this will create things, because\nyou also change in the process.
You will create things\nthat you might not
have been able to\ncreate two years ago,
because you didn't\nhave the calmness.
And now you're capable\nof using this material
and can produce just\nas beautiful things
that you thought two\nyears ago that material
is unsuitable for your work.
And this is the way how\nyou have to address it,
and you know that the world\nis open towards the top.
And you can piece by piece\nadd and approximate whatever
you would like to achieve.
If you achieve something\n100%, your world
becomes limited or you're just\nat the target close to the sun.
You've reached your goal.
The point is something you\ndo not quite achieve 100%.
And that's the nature of things.
And I do not know an\nabsolute masterpiece at all.
I know wonderful\nmasterpieces only.
Well, I didn't say\nmuch about material.
But I accept every material\nthat you would give me.
And then I say, well, let's see.
Maybe we'll find something.
We can do something with it.
And I would be open.
I would always compare it\nto sculptures, sculpting
and painting.
Look at painters or sculptors.
A sculpture by that\nsculptor, it could
have been said that he wasn't\nable to show sensuality
of the body.
He had this motive in the face\nand the body of his main model
who had a sensual model.
He did not have a\nreal subject there.
And then he invented\nthis wonderful foot.
He knew everything\nabout history.
He knew about\nEtruscan sculptures.
And he made these\nwonderful sculptures.
And if you cut out a piece, this\nsmall piece of this sculpture,
will be very different\nfrom an archaic sculpture
of the Greeks, because here\neven a fragment contains
a little bit of a substance.
That's our novel, our new times.
We can reach the\nsame level in art,
but we have become\nway more vulnerable,
much more vulnerable, I say.
But we can create\nparticipation in art.
So we heard you speak of\nproportion before, but--
[speaking german]
Yeah, sure.
I'd like to do that.
I could talk until tomorrow, if\nyou have that many questions.
If one has to say\nthings in one hour--
and proportion has\nalways something
to do with measurements\nand dimensions.
Like back then when\nI was a young man,
these proportions\nand measurements
are an important\nelement, to give an idea,
substantial and\nindestructible content.
My drafts have a basic\nstability that is indestructible
and cannot be destroyed\nat the building site.
For example, if the foreman is\nin a bad mood because he has--
whatever the design\nis, the proportions
provide stability to the house.
And they go way over the\nquestion of materials used.
And what systems you\nneed, proportions,
dimensional systems in\nnumbers, that is open.
You have to decide for\nyourself how this all works.
You can write the numbers\ndown in the plans.
But if you have this basic\nstability in your draft,
in your design, the house, the\nbuilding, or the urban space
will always be good.
Whether a simple material is\nused and it's correctly built
or an inexpensive\nmaterial is used,
the most tragic\nbuildings for me are
those that have bad\ndimensions and want
to cover it up with very\nexpensive applications
of materials.
I'm sorry for these buildings.
The dimensional design is much\nfarther up in the hierarchy.
So when you determine\nyour dimensions,
no one will talk you out of it.
No one will even\ninterfere with you,
and it doesn't cost any money.
And this is the area where the\nmain stability of a building
comes from.
And therefore I\nrecommend that you
deal with the\nmeasurements, dimensions,
and seek to implement that.
I don't know a nice beautiful\nGerman word about the teaching.
Our architectural profession\nworks via emptiness and not
via the fullness.
We think the first\ndraft is empty at first.
Between two elements\nthere's space, empty space.
The empty space in\nbetween our elements
can build an almost\nelectrical tension.
The air in between can be\njust normal, commonplace,
or it can be exciting.
And the dimension,\nthe measurement
between, if there's no\ntension, the building
will have less constant appeal.
But whatever we\ndo, it's always how
we handle the emptiness between\nthe spaces and the stability.
To provide tension\nto the empty spaces
is what you determine\nby giving measurements
to both the material elements\nas well as the emptiness.
And you have to measure\nout so many sketches
and translate it\ninto dimensions.
And if you work with\na proportion system,
and if you have\nan accurate line,
you can make an approximation\nto the left or right,
and in our system even,\nat the center once again.
And that's where the tension is.
And the deceitful\nthing of a sketch is
is that it deviates\nfrom the orthogonal.
And that's why I sometimes\nsay, in a facade,
should we move the\nline a little bit
inward or outwards to provide\ntension to the overall facade?
And this is something\nthat takes a lot of work,
a long period of work\nwhere you have to find out
where these dimensions are and\nhow they relate to one another
to create this tension\nthat you need to achieve.
And that costs.
That is work.
That takes a lot of time.
And because I was a\ndropout during my studies,
I couldn't make the drawings.
And therefore I\ndealt with it later
and found a dimensional\nsystem, which is basically
based in very simple geometric\nshapes, the triangulum,
the golden section\nas the main ratio.
And from there you\ngo to 1/8, 1/16.
And people keep asking me,\ndoes this have something
to do with music?
And I'm saying no,\nnot with music.
It's just simple\nwhat I've found.
The triangulum is\nvery close to 7/8,
and the golden section\nis very close to 5/8.
And because I'm combining the\ndiscussions about these two
concepts, the triangulum\nand the golden sections,
I said I combine\nthese to some extent.
I work with these.
And division is only allowed\nby even numbers, so 8, 16,
and so on, never 3, 5.
And the computer loves it\nwhen it gets integral figures.
Computer likes precise numbers.
A computer is a very good tool.
It's an instrument.
Sorry, the dimensions I\nmeant, not the computer.
They're an instrument to use.
So can the computer.
Peter, thank you very much.
[speaking german]
Thank you very much\nfor a great lecture.
Thank you very much to our\ntranslator in San Francisco.
[applause]
Thank you.
As you can tell,\nthis conversation
can go on for quite some time.
I think Peter just mentioned the\nword computer at the very end.
And the relationship between the\nhand drawing and the computer
could be, of course, the subject\nof a much longer discourse
and discussion.
But what I hope\nhas been made clear
is way in which Peter works\nis really very, very different
than so many other\nexperiences that we see today.
And his relationship just to\nthe drawing, the thickness
of the pencil, the\nrelationship between the body
and the drawing itself\nthat really produces
the final outcome is all\npart of a longer conversation
around this question of\nprecision and clarity
and the way in which the\nambiguity of the line itself
is actually part of the\nprocedures of thinking
and revealing.
And there's a lot\nmore about history
and his love of the Romanesque\nand things like that.
But hopefully he'll\ncome back and he'll
spend more time with all of\nus and discuss these things.
Really, thank you all very much.
And I hope that you found\nthe conversation productive.
Thank you, Peter,\nfor everything.
Thank you.
[applause]
