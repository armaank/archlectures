Well, good evening, everyone.
Thank you for joining us.
There's many of you that\nhave come from outside,
we are very grateful.
I'm Anita Berrizbeitia,\nChair of the Department
of Landscape Architecture,\nfor those of you
that don't know me.
I hope the students will trickle\nin, their reviews are looming.
And so, let's see.
And I am very happy to\nwelcome Stig Andersson
to the last event of the year.
We've had a very wonderful\nseries this year,
and we are culminating it with\none of the great designers
in Europe.
Stig Andersson is\na founding partner
of SLA Architects, established\nin 1994 in Copenhagen.
And now with offices\nin Aarhus and Oslo.
And he is a professor at the\nUniversity of Copenhagen.
The firm has a very extensive\ninternational portfolio
of built work in all types of\ncontexts and scales of material
and spatial transformation.
In many ways, the\nprojects are informed
by the imperatives of today,\nthose of ecological planning,
energy conservation, water\nmanagement, remediation,
conservation.
Yet at the same time, SLA\nexplores and activates
what they call the necessary\ncomplementarity between natural
and constructed landscapes.
This idea is productive\nin their work,
because it enables a complex\ncoexistence of agendas,
opening the way for\nformal and material
expression and a\nrenewed investigation
into issues of landscape\ncharacter and visual quality--
that is aesthetics.
Andersson speaks\nabout the necessity
of establishing an aesthetic\nposition in design,
in the face of extreme\nrationalization
of its processes and\nits argumentation.
This was the theme\nof his installation
for the Danish pavilion at the\n2014 Venice Biennale titled,
The Empowerment of Aesthetics.
In his formulation, the creation\nof a new aesthetic for nature
is a fundamental\npart of the ethic
of working in the Anthropocene.
Rather than remaining on\na crisis response that
is supported by all the\nnecessary regulatory frameworks
that define and\nbracket our practice,
he argues that these need to\nbe paired with essentials,
the poetic, and the tactile.
A quote from his exhibition\nreads, "for too long,
whenever we had to make a case\nfor what our future should
look like, we have focused\non the rational aspect.
We have not understood that the\naesthetic aspect complements
the rational.
This means that we must find\nan entirely new language
to talk about the\nvalue of aesthetics,
a language in which\nthe [inaudible] amenity
value of a tree, for example,\nis as important as a tree's
usefulness, in terms of\nsoaking up rainwater, absorbing
CO2, and making our\nhouse prices soar."
End of quote.
As you will see\ntonight, their work
exudes an optimism\nthat is centered
on the development of\nthis broadly understood
aesthetic value of landscapes.
Celebrated through the\nattention of scale,
materials, and the specific\nways in which we can and need
to construct the interface\nbetween cities and nature,
buildings and landscape,\nand people and landscape.
SLA has received the European\nAward, The Guardian Award,
the Royal Institute of\nBritish Architects Award,
the World Landscape Architecture\nAward, and the CF Hansen
Medal-- which is the\nhighest national honor given
to a Danish designer.
Please join me in\nwelcoming Stig Andersson.
[applause]
Thank you very much.
Thank you for the kind words.
Yeah, good evening,\nand thank you
for inviting me to Harvard\nUniversity, and talk on my view
and approach to\nlandscape architecture.
And I will show some of our\nprojects from their office.
But I start 30,000\nyears ago, when
the ice began to retreat\nafter the last ice age.
A huge pressure on the\nEarth's crust was relieved
and a new life began to grow.
The first people from the\nStone Age learned to use fire,
they picked it up from\nwildfire and lightning strikes,
they learned to delimit it,\nand to keep it alive with wood.
Later, they learned to\ncreate fire themselves.
Man learned to control\nand create fire,
and to put out the fire.
The first step in man's\nseparation from nature
was taken.
It is not far from creating\nfire to cultivate the earth,
and to consume fossil\nfuel for energy,
and to replace nature process\nas the mechanical technology.
Thousands of years have\nelapsed and today, we
see the result of\nman-made activities.
Before man came to Iceland--
one of the\nScandinavian islands--
the whole island was\ncovered with forest.
Man began to use wood\nfor fire, for building,
and to cultivate land.
Finally, all the forest\non the island was replaced
by an unexpected and unforeseen\nnew and man-made nature--
what you see on the screen.
This demands a new\nunderstanding and description
of what the relationship between\nman and the new nature is.
Sorry, something is missing.
OK.
Activities like this\nhave fundamentally
changed the global environment,\nthat geological processes
and the ecosystems.
It has brought us into\na new global state, what
we call the Anthropocene era.
The Anthropocene is a term\nwidely used to name the fact
that many ecosystems and\ngeologically significant
conditions and processes--\nlike biodiversity and climate--
have been profoundly\noutset by human activities.
This is the first time\nwe live in a global state
where the nature that\nwas here before us
has irreversibly changed into\na new nature that has the form
and expression, as a result\nof our way of consuming
natural resources.
In other words,\nwe have interfered
in nature's processes so\nvital that they are no longer
the nature we knew.
We are co-creator of the new\nand the Anthropocene nature.
It means we are now\nresponsible for our own destiny
and common future.
With this recognition,\nthe distinction
between nature and culture\nas two separated concepts
can no longer be preserved.
The two are woven\ninto each other.
This demands a new\nunderstanding and description
of what the relationship between\nman and the new nature is.
This image you see here is\nfrom Ussuri Bay in Vladivostok,
in Russia.
It's a dumping pit for\nwaste glass disposal.
You'd have changed\nthe local nature
to a new, where the\neroded glass pieces are
mixed with eroded and\nbillions of years old stones
and form a new nature.
This image you see here are from\na project we call a new nature.
It's in Fredericia, in Denmark,\na small town village not far
from Copenhagen. A\nformer industrial plant
in the harbor of the city\nfor production of chemicals--
organic chemicals.
The underground is\nstill very contaminated.
All buildings were removed, and\nleft over was an open field.
We provided a combination\nof many and new materials--
different materials,\nbiotic and mineral,
artificial and man-made--
that through time\ninteract and create
and new nature that\nunfolds, depending
on the local weather,\nthe soil, the salty wind,
and other local conditions.
I show you here a\nseries of images
from the construction\ntime, carried out
because of our design.
The construction workers\nwas following the drawings.
It might look a little bit\nsloppy, it is on purpose.
The goal was not architectural\ncontrol or order,
but to show the\nunfinished-- that which
is changing constantly in the\nprogression when the elements
react with each other.
We were interested in how\nwe can create a new view
on the concept of nature.
Show it again, I think.
We were interested in how\nwe can create a new view
on the concept of nature,\nrecognizing that we are
co-creator of the new nature.
We would also\ninvestigate what it
meant for the perception of\na landscape architecture.
It is our knowledge\nand understanding
of how the universe came\ninto being which underlies
the design methodology,\nand the way
we started the process of\ndeveloping a new nature,
based on the interaction\nbetween the elements.
I can explain a little\nbit more on that.
In the few nanoseconds just\nafter Big Bang 14 and 1/2
billion years ago, the\ntwo most simple elements--
helium and hydrogen--
were created.
Due to their electrical charges,\nthey cannot react with each
other.
14 and 1/2 billion\nyears later, we
sit here in the\nauditorium at Harvard,
and take the note\nthat they actually
could react with each other.
And one of the outcome\nof this is a speaker.
But it is also everything else\nwe see and sense around us.
I find that quite fascinating.
Scientists have a few years\nago, in the Northeast of China,
found an extremely well\npreserved fossil of a cricket.
It was possible to reconstruct\na digital wing etch,
and a digital edition\nof the pin surface
the cricket had\nused as a string,
like we play on a violin.
I play it for you.
[cricket chirping]
And they were able to\nreconstruct the cricket love
song.
So you are listening to the\nlove song from the cricket
165 million years later than it\nwas last time sung or played.
So the outcome of Big Bang, 14\nand 1/2 billion years later,
is this speaker,\nand you can hear
the sound of the male cricket\ncalling for the female.
It is a result of\nvery simple formula,
and the property of this\nstarting point conditions--
helium and hydrogen, the\ntwo most simple elements--
and the unexpected reaction\nbetween their atoms, electrons,
power fields, and dust to form\na sound that we today can recall
and listen to live.
So this methodology is what\nwe use when we do design.
This is what we did\nin Fredericia project.
So that's why it\nlooks very sloppy,
when you saw the photographs\nfrom the construction site,
because we wanted everyone\nto be aware of looking
at this in a new way.
So it's a new nature, we cannot\nuse the same language or way
of think things\nshould look like.
It is unpredictable what\nhappens over a long time, when
the elements that everything is\nmade from react with each other
and create something new.
We've got woods, forest,\ntrees, and bark--
like in this back room\nfrom the exhibition
we had in The Empowerment\nof Aesthetics in Venice
Biennale four years ago.
An intimate room, like an\ninterior of a building of bark
that used to be on the\noutside of the tree.
So you walk inside the\nbark universe, so to say.
You can't touch it, you can\nfeel it, you can smell it,
and you can--
often people in there\nbegin talking together.
Talk about nature, and what\nthis bark surface, the smell,
to them.
What it do to you?
It's amazing that the\nfoundation of this
is helium and hydrogen,\nand a huge waste space,
and a lot of time just waiting.
So what is under control is\nall the starting conditions,
but not the outcome.
The Anthropocene era, 14\nand 1/2 billion years later,
called for a new view\nand vision of nature
in the built environment.
The vision that can describe\nwhat the new nature is,
how we understand it,\nand how we learn from it
when we practice\nlandscape architecture.
At the exhibition\nempowerment of aesthetics,
I showed how we, in\nthe Nordic region,
have a unique foundation for\nformulating a new perspective
on nature, and using it in the\ncreation of a new landscape
architecture.
I formulated the view that\nthe built environment, which
we have the habit of calling\narchitecture, is only one half
of the concept of architecture.
The other half is the\ngrown environment,
and relates to the\nexhibition title, Empowerment
of Aesthetics.
Where aesthetics is\nto be understood--
as the German\nphilosopher Immanuel Kant
defines it-- as sensuous.
Not how things look like,\nbut how you feel them,
what they do to you deep inside.
Not to sense, but the feeling\nyou feel when you sense.
It is not the sense organ\nthat is interesting,
but the feeling and\nthe power this feeling
has for you, your own\nway of understanding
yourself and your relation\nto nature's processes,
and what means to live.
It is a very strong\npower, and it
is the one that makes us\nexperience the sublime.
The sublime is when nature\nphenomenon embrace you,
and your unexpected feel of\nrelation to the phenomenon
deep inside you.
The sublime is something\nyou find in nature,
it's not something in art\nthat we often are told.
The build on the\ngrown environment,
I see as complementary\nto each other, each
with their own paradigm.
The grown environment is all\nthe matter and natural processes
that are constant--
mutable, grow, and follow\nthe order of nature.
It is imperfect, and\nwill never be completed.
This is exactly what the\nproject in Fredericia was about.
The built environment\nis the unchangeable,
the perfection that will be\ncompleted as form and shape.
It is all that follow\nthe Cartesian thinking.
And for both of\nthem to apply, we
need to give up the\nidea that only one
paradigm can be the truth.
They oppose, and at the\nsame time, the truth.
That is that they both\npresuppose each other,
and at the same time\nexclude each other
in the understanding of what\nis a complete architecture.
Thus, the paradigm of\nthe built environment,
with its language of proportion,\nscale, hierarchy, geometry,
and construction, exists\nat the very same time
as the paradigm of\nthe grown environment,
with its language of grow,\nchange, order of nature,
biodiversity, and\nphotosynthesis.
The two together are the\nentire concept of architecture,
and must therefore be equal\npresent for urban development
to adapt to the new\ngeological reality.
So what we face today is\nthat the world have too much
built environment.
So we have, for thousands\nof years, practice
and architecture with\nonly a half solution.
No wonder we have problems.
This is our proposal\nfor a new headquarter
for the international\npharmaceutical company Novo
Nordisk, north of\nCopenhagen. It is
an example on how we use\nthe complementarity view
on architecture.
This is how a headquarter\nusually looks like.
You have squared up\ndifferent buildings,
you have parking area,\nand a lot of paved area.
So you come into\na site like this,
you have to find\na parking space,
it could also be raining.
So you are late for the\nmeeting, because there
was no free parking\nspace, or when
you found one you had\nto walk quite a lot
to get into the building, and\nit was raining so you are wet.
This is a very good\nstart on a meeting.
But this is how we have\ndone for many, many years.
We proposed to change this\nusual model of a headquarter
from a complex of offices\nbuilding to one free standing
building, very compact, with\nall the functions inside,
and the setting in\na grown environment.
Now, I'll show you\na picture that's
taken from exactly the same\nposition a half year later.
Today, it is a roof of\na parking construction--
we call it nature park--
and it is on the same level as\nthe surrounding neighborhoods,
so no one knows that all\nthe parking is underneath.
Even more cars can\nbe parked there.
Everyone can come\ninto the construction.
Everyone can come in\nto this headquarter
without getting wet.
Everyone can easily\nfind a parking space.
And everyone have the grown\nenvironment as the attraction.
We designed the nature park\nas an overgrown environment,
complimentary to the\nbuilt environment,
so the two together can\nconstitute a complex complete
architecture.
And not just a half\nsolution, as we usually
see, where only the\nbuilding with the functional
services around it is in focus.
And complete architecture,\nwhere the relationship
between geometrical\nstructure of the building,
according to the logic and\nform of the constructed
architecture, and the\never-changing mutable
expression of the grown\non an equal level.
We work carefully with more than\n1,000 new trees to be planted.
Many different\nspecies, and each tree
is carefully selected in several\nof major European nurseries.
We have people from the office\ntraveling around in Europe
to find the trees, because we\nwere looking for all the trees
that they couldn't sell.
All the trees that were\ncrooked had character,
and most clearly show natural\ncharacteristic growth.
It's not what you can\nsell from a nursery.
So they have a\nlot of these trees
that they don't know\nwhat to do with.
We bought them all.
They are now at Novo.
And actually, it's\nquite interesting,
because it's changing\nthe nursery--
especially in Denmark.
So the different\nnurseries ask us now,
how should we grow trees?
Because they see\nthat the trend has
changed from this artificially\narchitecturally tree to tree
to a more natural growing trees.
So we are now in a process\nwhere we are changing
the business for the nurseries.
All the trees had a name--
Latin name, of course--
have an age, have a region,\nand it's all categorized.
So these two girls you see here\nfrom their staff organizing,
they know exactly which\ntree they are placing where.
So we built up a new ecosystem\nwith the different expertise
we have from gardeners\nand others in the office.
So it's a purely\nartificial created
new biological ecosystem.
This is the grown\nenvironment man-made.
Some of the trees were more\nthan 30 years old, some of them
died on the way up from\nGermany or Holland--
wherever-- to Denmark.
Usually they will be\nreplaced by another one,
but not in this case.
So we place all the dead trees--
all the trees dying--
they are still because it\nraises the biodiversity
and the whole system of creating\nhabitat for insects and birds.
After half year, we have\ndifferent bees coming here,
settle down in this new habitat\nthat we haven't seen in Denmark
for many, many years.
So the Copenhagen\nUniversity have
been monitoring to see how this\nnew nature is providing life
as a habitat.
So it's an ecosystem, as a\nliving self-regulated habitat,
where the gardeners'\nmaintenance is
to support the biological\ndevelopment, to increase
the biodiversity, and\nprovide more and more matter
that can attract insects,\nbirds, and people.
It is not to achieve a\nparticular visual or formal
expression.
The new nature perform both\nfor cleaning the soil, air,
and water through the many\ntrees collecting rainwater
from cloudburst, and\nreuse it in the function
of the planting\ninside the building
to perform to\nincrease biodiversity
in the industrial\nsurrounding area
and ensure economical\ngrowth, [inaudible],,
and attract the right stuff.
The living habitat is\nalso the innovation lab
for the researchers to invent\nnew knowledge and product
for the company.
Usually they have innovation\nlab inside the building,
usually it's spaced\nwith different colors,
funny furnitures,\nand stuff like that.
But now, they found\nout that it actually
developed much more interesting\ndiscussion being in nature.
You all know that,\nwhen you need to relax,
when you come up\nwith new ideas, you
try to find a place where you'll\nmeet the natural phenomena that
always embrace us.
What was the hardest job in\nthis process of one year, where
we have to convince\nthe directors of Novo
that some of the trees have\nto be right in the path.
So logically, of course,\nthey ask, why should there
be a tree right in the path?
Then you have to go around it.
That's the point.
It took one year to\nconvince them why.
So it is an auto\ninnovation lab, and it's
the place where the employees\nmeet, exchange knowledge,
and solve problems, and\nmeet with their clients,
and collaborators.
So you see here the two\nguys coming up, discussing.
Now there is a tree.
They struggle to get around it.
But when you find\nthis tree in the way,
he was forced to go around it.
And it is in the same\nsecond you are distracted
when something new can\nhappen in your thinking,
and in the conversation.
This is innovation.
This from the very beginning.
This is also why there are so\nmany paths and crossings points
at this site.
It's about having most people\nmeeting each other most times.
So no parallel structure,\nalways crossing.
The new nature is the\nempowerment of a new thinking.
The new nature perform\nwell on the four key nodes,
which is important for\nNovo's economic growth,
environmental protection,\nsocial equality,
and cultural diversity.
This is the first time\nthat Novo used nature
as part of the branding.
A landscape\narchitecture that works
on its own paradigm\nand not just have
the purpose of showing beautiful\nproportions of the build.
This opens for\nanother understanding
of what landscape\narchitecture is,
and how it can give us\nmore value than the way
we have been looking at\nit for the last 200 years.
The concept of\nlandscape architecture
come from art history.
It appears for the first\ntime less than 200 years ago,
in the book on the\nlandscape architecture
of great painters in Italy.
The book is an art\ntheoretical review
on how a building,\nby its location
in an untouched nature,\ncan show the potential
of the grown environment\nto highlight the beauty
proportions of the builds.
So here, on the screen, you see\nillustrations from the book.
In this conventional scene,\nlandscape architecture
have the function of servicing\nthe built environment.
It means to emphasize\nthe quality of the built
environment and nothing else.
But the new nature\nand the new climate
we are living within\ntoday no longer
show the beauty of the built\nor the built environments.
It rather shows how fragile\nour cities are build,
and how weak the cities are\ninfrastructurally organized.
Our conventional view on\nthe purpose of landscape
architecture is challenged.
Challenged since it\nrather show the weakness
of the builds than\nshows the beauty of it.
When few people see the beauty\nin the new wind and rain--
and most people fear\nthe wind and rain--
we need to reconsider\nthe concept of beauty,
and what is nature in\nthe European context.
As I see it and practice a\nnew approach to landscape
architecture, is that--
which can bring a new order\ninto our built environment,
so it becomes much\nmore livable and adjust
to the new climate geology and\nthe era that we are part of.
On the screen here is\nthe ongoing development
of a housing quarter in\nCopenhagen called [inaudible]..
The local inhabitants, and the\nlocal landowner association
asked us, after 10\nyears looking at this,
to bring living and growing\nmatter to the built environment
in order to raise the level\nof experienced life quality.
As complimentary to\nthe focus on form--
the build-- the grown\nis focused on matter.
The function of the grown is not\nto emphasize qualities in the
build, but to provide\nresidents with the opportunity
for natural experiences in the\nhabitat with insects, birds,
and plant, and social relations\nbetween the local residents.
Which is also what\nhappened here.
So now we are changing\nall these lawns
in the whole quarter with\nthis kind of planting.
And we are guiding\nthe people there,
so we are not doing the\ndesign all the time,
we are explaining\nthem how to do it.
Where to buy seeds,\nwhere to buy trees--
so they get involved\nin the project himself.
Because what we are after here\nis not so much how it looks,
but how it feels.
How does it embrace the people?
How does it qualify the social\nrelations between people?
Another issue is that\nin this sort of areas
there are still a lot of square\nmeters where you can do that.
But in other places,\nthere's no more
square meters left to\nprovide the grown environment
to improve the\nquality of the city.
Far most areas in the\ncities are urban densified,
have a character like this.
There is no space for\nthe grown environment.
The more that is built, the\nmore absent becomes the growth.
Which is interesting, because\nthis is what people ask for.
This is what we all ask for.
Therefore, the built\nenvironment have
to perform the missing nature,\nand the missing opportunities
should be embraced\nby the phenomenon
of natural processes.
And to do so we have to\nchange the urban environment.
An example on this is\nthe parking construction
as a foundation for a\nnew and man-made nature
in the dense urban\ncontext of Copenhagen.
The roof of this construction\nof a two story parking building
is folded from the\nstreet level and set
in meters up to a promenade.
Under the promenade are\nthe different features
to services in the neighborhood.
These all rest on the very\ncontaminated underground, which
[inaudible] avoided to remove.
We named the\nproject [inaudible]..
It is in the heart of Copenhagen\nthat, for a long time,
have been considered\nas left over.
A dune is a pile of\nsand raising itself
several meter over\nthe surrounding land.
It has a steep slope\non 20-30 degrees,
and you have in the\n[inaudible] side,
and a weaker slope\non the wind side.
A dune consist of sand--
billions of tiny\nlittle grain of sand--
they are all alike, almost the\nsame size, form, and color.
It is this granite\neroded from old mountains
and rounded by the\nwind, and constantly
moving on top of each\nother, never resting.
It's like cement.
They are connected and\nshape different forms,
depending on the direction\nof the wind, the temperature,
and the local air, and the\n[inaudible] of the grains.
We are seeing the\nshape of the dune being
created while it happens.
The migration sand\ndune is constantly
shaped by the wind\nand the micro-climate.
Study of dunes\nare without scale.
The scale is defined\nin the second
when your studies\nare transformed
into a physical site.
This is what we did\nhere with our design.
In a similar way\nas with the dune,
the small grains in\nconcrete are connected
to shape the city dune.
It folds in one large\nand current movement.
Like the pattern of clouds,\nthe form of the surface
have no reputation.
It's all-over unique.
It is [inaudible] and bright\nwhite concrete surface
of 7,500 square\nmeters, with a series
of many and different smaller\nspaces, hollows, and curves,
all at the time\nunbroken, just as
a dune you meet while\nwalking in the dune
landscape at the coast.
The matter remains the same,\nand constitute a wholeness just
like water and air.
Sand can also not be separated.
By making the surface\nof the concrete
as large as possible\nand bright white,
we can also raise the\nalbedo effect to a maximum.
It means, we can keep the\nincoming sunlight at the site
and return the incoming heat\nradiation back to the air.
The result is a\ncooler micro-climate
during the warm\nperiods of the year,
and keeping the brightness of\nthe light within the space.
And this is two\nphenomena that you
can feel very strongly without\nbeing much aware about it.
Just passing this area\non the pedestrian line
makes you aware that something\nelse is happening here.
When you both feel\nthe small breeze,
but also when you feel or\nsense the light on this site.
We collect all the\nrainwater falling
on the sides, fall\nto the plants,
and to irrigate\nthe whole system.
It cools the air and give the\nsite a moisturizing atmosphere.
It creates a small\nbreeze that you
can feel when you're passing.
It is a composition\nof spaces that
slide in and out of each\nother, and can be experienced
through your movement.
The atmosphere you sense is here\nfavoring the sensuous ability
in both the near and\nthe far environment.
You see the surrounding\nscenery of the city
in a completely new\nperspective that you else
have seen in the city.
The verity of space appeal\nto your so-called flowing
intelligence.
It means appeal to you\nability to navigate
through a stream of\ninformation, instead
of crystallized intelligence\nof memorizing knowledge already
known, like elsewhere\nyou move in the city.
So it challenge you\nwhile you're moving here.
The flowing intelligence\nis activated
through the shift in\nterrain, the plantation,
the local weather, and\nother people moving around.
When you walk around\non this [? rain, ?]
you experience\nonly parts of it--
fragments of a whole, a whole\nthat is never to be grasped,
unlike the way you grasp a\nbuilding or most other sites
in the city.
All these small and\ndifferent impressions-- a lot
of fragments put together--\nform a subjective image.
An image that is a result of\nconcrete observation and sensed
sensation while you\nare moving around.
So that gives you a relationship\nto this specific site.
And this is exactly the same way\nyou do when you are in nature,
when you were in the forest,\nwhen you're on the beach.
So the way you experience it,\nthe way you perceive yourself
these position, is exactly the\nsame we are after creating,
but in an open condition.
To visit will never be the same.
Next time you are here,\nyou will find another route
and the space will\nappear differently
as it changed both with the\nweather, the light, the time,
the grow, and your\nown state of mind.
We discover in this\na new order, which
is a result of all the\nlittle bits and pieces
we see and sense.
And we try to get an overview,\na subjective view of the space
that will replace the overview.
It constitutes a new\nand personable image
of the space and\nits objects that
is much more and\nlarger than what
a single photo or plain\ndrawing can uncover.
So it's not a\ndesign here-- is not
an arrangement\nthat minds nature.
It is a new manner of\nseeing and experiencing
nature in the city, both\nas an organization system
and the system of change.
The ambition is to create a\nview of the new nature that
is different from\nthe view we have
on the nature that was here--\nthat belongs to the past.
A view that the new nature is\nsomething we design and clarify
what the grown environment can\ndo to you in the urban context.
There's three years\nbetween the two photo here.
So what you experienced\nthe first time
is very different from what you\nexperienced through the years.
The building on the\nside is still the same.
So that defines\nvery clearly what
is the difference between\nthe built environment
and the grown environment.
The title of today's\ntop, after nature,
refer to the\nman-made abstraction
of the natural order.
The new nature, the grown\nenvironment, and in this case
the city dune is a\nman-made composition
based on inside\nin nature, and how
nature processes and phenomenon\nawake feelings in you,
embrace you, and through\na man-made abstraction
of elements have\nremoved as much as
possible related\nto the image, so
that only the essence remains.
You can say that the image\nof nature, as we know it,
is taken out of the object--
the dune-- and left is\nthe matter and the way
you sense it.
At the exhibition\nempowerment of aesthetics,
I had placed sand\nfrom the island called
[inaudible] as a specific coast\narea of [inaudible] called
[inaudible].
And I placed sand from there\non the Italian sandstone
inside the Danish pavilion.
The sand from [inaudible]\nhas a particular sound
when you step on it, it is\ncrushing both hard and feels
soft, and acts in a dry\nstate as if it was moisty.
You know it from the beach, from\nthe sand dune and the coast,
and I wanted to bring\nthis specific feeling,
the sense of beach and water, of\nsand, into the pavilion space.
And through this\nspecific contact
with the matter, the\npure element of sand--
this [? elysium-- ?] the\nvisitor's aesthetic sense
for nature through\nan abstraction.
That dune is not here, but\nwith the sound and the feeling,
stepping onto the matter--
the sound-- the dune,\nthe beach or even the
sound of the waves from the\nsea comes into your mind
from your memory,\nbut all in fragments.
This is just what\nhappened to the little boy
who one day visit the\npavilion with his mother.
When he stepped on the\nsand [inaudible] floor,
he looked around and I ask\nher, where's the water?
I call this the aesthetic\nsense of nature.
It is the presence of physic\nmatter, living and mineral,
together with the\nlocal weather--
light, humidity, and wind--
create an atmosphere of\nsomething indefinable
that embrace you as you\nsense before thinking.
That is what I strive\nfor in my design.
The grown environment delivers\nboth rational ecosystem
services, like trees,\nthat cleans the air
for particular pollution.
And they convert carbon dioxide\ninto oxygen by photosynthesis
and using rainwater\nto do so to grow.
And we can all breathe--
breathe and share the\nsame air that there's
all over the world.
The grown environment is\nboth the ecosystem service
and that which awakens your\naesthetic sense of nature.
We arrange the Danish culture\nscent in Beijing, in China,
with pine trees of\nvarieties that today all
grow in the city.
In the west, we have\nthe habit of seeing
trees that defies the\nexternal forces, such as wind
and pruning, to get\na shape that is just
show the struggle as beautiful.
In the eastern culture,\nthe free growing pine tree
not formed by external forces,\nsuch as wind or pruning,
or stressed environment\nis considered beautiful.
This is the true fundamental\ndifferent way views on beauty,
and I see them both necessary\nfor today's understanding
the term of beauty.
With the exhibition here,\nI was interested to show
the deep and 1,000 year old\ntradition of appreciating
the pine tree as a\npower that can both heal
stress, and counteract\na stressed environment,
and purify the\nair for pollution,
and create an option for our\ncity to act like a forest.
The pine trees transform a\nhuge amount of rain water
into produce and photosynthesis,\nwhere the air's NOx gases
convert to harmless\ngases, and carbon dioxide
become oxygen. If this can\nbe scaled from that limit
by one single individual\ntree, there are
billions of trees to be used.
This is precisely what\nwe radically changed,
and this is precisely\nwhat radically
will change the expression\nof big growing cities,
and the basis for\nour quality of life.
The city will itself\nperform the missing nature,
and the shapes of the trees\nwill express what beauty
means for people in the city.
Every morning, trees\nwere sprayed with water
so the whole space\nsmelled of the needles
and felt more cool than\noutside in the summer heat.
The trees grew through the\nentire exhibition period.
It was obviously--\nand you could see it.
The steady sense of\nnature make us aware
the nature's processes\nare not just and only
a threat we must fight\nagainst, because we
believe the goal is to survive.
The goal is quite opposite.
It is to live, it's\nabout the act of living.
As the Swedish [? etymologist ?]\nand author [? frederik ?]
[? schuber ?] clearly expressed,\n"you cannot build a community
based on fear, because no one\ncan be bothered to be afraid
for so long.
An initiative that\ndraws on nature feeling
lasts much longer."
This is the Empowerment\nof Aesthetics.
Aesthetics, a\nsensory perception.
Not how things look,\nbut their ability
to evoke our intuitive feeling\nfor what nature can do to us.
And it's a method for design.
Two years ago, we were\ninvited to participate
in the international competition\nabout Reinventing Paris.
We were in team with\nJacques Ferrier Architects.
And with BMP Real\nEstate as a client,
we developed a\nbusiness case buying
the right to build approximately\n5,000 square meter in the air
space about le peripherique.
We proposed a strategy that\naims, the more you build,
the more clean air.
We all do know the convention,\nthe more infrastructure
you build, and the\nmore build environment
you provide, the less open space\nfor living and growing matter.
That is not new.
In this case here,\nbuilding on top
of the space of le\nperipherique, there
is no space for the\ngrown environment.
Therefore, the building\nhave to act and perform
the missing nature,\nboth the ecosystem
services and their\naesthetic sense of nature.
This is new, a building that\nperformed the missing nature.
By that, the grown\nand living matter
will increase the\nbiodiversity, clean the air,
reduce stress, increase\nsustainability,
and make space for a new\nrecognition of ourself
as part of a new\nand man-made nature
in the very dense, noisy Paris.
By building in the air space\nabove le peripherique--
32 kilometers--\nmore and more people
to gain access to experience\nprocesses of nature
than they do today\nwhere nature is absent.
Le peripherique is also a\nbarrier between the suburbs
and inner Paris.
So if you use this\nstrategy building
32 kilometers of this kind\nof building I'm showing you,
you will not only have\nmuch cleaner air in Paris,
but you will also have access to\nnature in the very dense city.
So our clean air strategy both\ncleans the highly contaminated
air for life threaten\npm10 and pm2.5 particles,
while at the same time create\na new nature that embrace you,
fill you with aesthetic\nsense of phenomena of nature,
right in the heavy\nbuilds, urban,
traffic-loaded environment.
We have research on which plans\nthe building facade should be
provided in order to\nmost efficiently increase
biodiversity and increase the\nability of the plant leaves
to collect pm2.5 particles.
Break down the wind, optimizing\nthe presence of light,
and making the outdoor\nspace as pleasant
and comfortable to\ndwell in as possible.
The ratio of green\nin a city are often
given by the [inaudible]\nsquare meter surface.
In this case, we provide\nas well the vertical areas
of facade's square meter.
Means we have a green ratio\nvalue here three to four times
larger than usually.
The built environment\nwill perform the process
as phenomenon of\nnature, and create space
where people can\nmeet, being social,
and create things together, like\nurban farming and the growth
of green tea--
maybe you already know,\nbut green tea does not
[? outstrip ?] NOx gases.
So you can grow green tea\nin a very polluted areas,
and drink it.
It requires a multidisciplinary\nteam of professionals
to create this.
In my own work at SLA,\nit means the staff
of gardeners, plant engineers,\nhorticultural experience,
forest experts, biologist,\njournalist, anthropologist,
philosophers, landscape\narchitect, architects,
planners, building economists,\nand so on and so on.
It is all that knowledge\non water, wind, sunlight,
and all the other\nfactors that forms
the design expression of the\nfacades of this building.
Traditional the architects\ndesigned the shape
of the building and the facade.
That was also the case\nin the projects of Novo
I showed you, that one\nbuilding and that was
the grown environment.
The two paradigm-- the built\nand the grown-- were separated.
Here in Paris, we try to\nmerge the two paradigms--
the build and the grown--
into an interwoven system.
It is a close cooperation\nbetween the architects,
the engineers, and\nus at the SLA office.
We are designing together\nthe whole building
complex and the facades.
The whole complex is it\nan advanced ecosystem
where the build\nenvironment coexist
and cooperate with\na grown environment
to provide office spaces\nand apartments that
perform in new nature.
We finish the schematics\ndesign last year,
and now we are waiting for\nconstruction permit coming
this spring.
Here, you see Paris\nwrapped up in smog.
The build environment is\nchallenged, and has already
clearly showed that the way\nwe build and have developed
urbanity so far is no\nlonger meaningful, if we
want more than just,\nand partly, to survive.
If we want more\nthan just survive,
we are forced to\norganize ourself
in societies where the\narchitecture is both the grown
and the built. And then to work\nas a system and not as usual
seems as a simple\nseparated constructions.
We cannot change the\ndevelopment we have started.
We can only adapt and\nadjust on a smaller scale,
and make local initiatives,\nas I have showed
you a number of examples on.
This is no grand or\nmagnificent plan.
There is no political\nagreement, either
on a global, national,\nor municipality scale.
As I see it, it is local\nactions and initiatives
that involves civil society.
It is an engaged civil\naction showing responsibility
and understanding that we are\nresponsible for our own destiny
and life, that can change\nthe way we used to look
at nature and life quality.
In this situation, it is\nthe lightness of nature--
a new nature-- that\nwe are co-creator of,
and the appreciation\nof the aesthetic sense
of nature that is the focal\npoint for social engagement
and actions.
This is what happened here\nin this local community,
[inaudible] showed earlier,\nwhere the new residents
asked us to change the flat\nlawn to a grown environment.
And this is also what\nhappened on this project
you see here on the screen,\nwhich is a new nature
park in Copenhagen where we\nchanged design of an existing
park into a new, so that\nall rainwater falling
into an overbuilt\nneighborhood in the future
has led to this specific\nside, and from here
partly slowly\ndeclined, and partly--
when it's cloudburst-- also\nrained off to the nearby lakes.
On the way to the lakes,\nthe water is also cleaned.
It's called\n[? hanstowsen's ?] Park,
and it gives the neighborhood a\nsocial boost at the same time,
by involving all the\nresidents in the neighborhood.
The project solves both\nthe water management
issue that the conventional\nway of building the cities
does not, solve a number\nof social problem,
and is the first\nkind of this project.
We start detail\ndesign this year.
There is a momentum for a\nnew approach to landscape
architecture that\nequals the build
and the grown environment to\nform a new architecture and new
[inaudible].
We have all the knowledge,\nthe location, the technology,
and the economy to do so.
We only need the decision\nmakers and the politicians,
and major influential companies\nand investment companies
show willingness\nand courage to act.
I can say without Hidalgo,\nthe mayor of Paris,
eager after to see a project\nlike the one I showed here,
it wouldn't have one.
We are now, all\nof us, responsible
for our common\ndestiny and future,
and that call for a new vision\nfor landscape architecture.
Thank you for your time.
OK, thank you so much\nfor the beautiful work.
We have a few moments for\nquestions from the audience.
Thank you very much.
It's a very beautiful park,\nit's just like the sort of place
I grew up in a long time ago.
But I live in the\nsuburbs of Boston,
and to create a\nlandscape like this
is potentially an\ninvitation to ticks
and increased number of cases\nof Lyme disease and other tick
borne diseases.
So it's a little\nbit frightening,
depending on the\nenvironment you come from.
How would you deal with\nthat issue of a changing
ecology, possibly due to\nglobal warming, or, you know,
just other factors?
And the risks that\nmay or may not
arise when you alter the\nlandscapes that people
are actually, physically,\nclosely intermingling with?
Children and others?
Is it clear?
Yeah.
One example is the\ncity dune project.
It was the first\npeople inhabiting
the space was the skaters.
And really skaters\nbringing ticks, as well.
So they make-- it's\na financial bank.
So the leaders of that make\nan agreement with the skaters,
that they can use the\nwhole area for skating.
It was one of north\nEurope's best skating ramps.
But if you destroy or damage\nsome of the plantation,
you are out.
So the skaters take\ncare of the place.
This is one of the\nplaces in Copenhagen,
there's no ticks at all.
There's no-- what is called--
ticks-- when you pain something.
Yeah, there's graffiti.
But is when you tell others\nthat it's your domain?
Tagging, yeah.
[inaudible]
So it's about how\npeople talk together.
Wait, I'm a little bit confused.
Maybe you understood me or not.
I'm talking about type of--\nit's not exactly an insect,
but let's say an insect--
ticks.
T-I-C-K-S.
OK.
Bite and carry disease.
Now I understand, yeah.
They live in the\nfields and the meadows.
I don't know what to say.
I can see it's about people\ntreating this, of course
there will be insects.
The whole point is\nto have insects.
No, this is an issue\nof insect vectors.
Like, you know,\nmosquitoes and malaria?
Yeah.
Well this is a bad analogy--
I don't think quickly.
But assuming in a tropical\ncountry where there's
malaria you build a very\nnice park like this with lots
of water and you increase\nthe mosquito population
of the particular vector\nfrom malaria 500 times.
What you will then\nget is an epidemic
of malaria in the area.
There is a problem, not\neverywhere in the world--
I know in some parts of\nEurope there is a problem.
But it's not insects,\ninsects are good in general.
But it's a problem of\nintroducing disease vectors--
vectors are insects which act\nas mechanisms by which diseases
are transferred to\npeople from other people,
or the insects themselves, or\nother animals in the ecosystem.
If you increase the\nvector population
in a region where\nthis is a problem,
you may create an increased\nrisk to people, and especially
children.
So I wonder to what degree\nthis issue is being addressed
by landscape architects?
Because it's an\nimportant one, actually.
We are not really--
not only landscape architects.
We also a lot of\nother professions.
So every place we work,\nwe investigate conditions.
So the project you see here\nlooks different other places
in the world.
So when we work in the\nMiddle East, or in China,
we do something else.
Now I just show these projects.
Of course, we are not\naiming at making malaria
a problem in the project.
But it's interesting.
I think it's a very\ninteresting question,
because more than 100,000 new\nmaterial had been developed
within a very short timeline.
When the welfare\nsystem was starting,
no one knew the\nconsequences of that.
Today we are\nstruggling with them.
I have a question\njust to follow up.
And I think you made\nvery, very good points.
And I would just\nlike one observation.
I don't know if\nyou agree on that.
If you have the grown nature\nor the grown environment,
there is a kind of melancholy\nwe have often when we see it.
You know, is something like\npast and the atmospheres.
We would love too long for it,\nbut its actually somehow gone.
And your built environment.
There is a kind of different\natmosphere with it,
working really with this kind\nof new approach about landscape
in cities, which is actually\nmore human interaction.
We can actually\nrelate more to it.
There is also more fun,\nits more interesting.
And its an\ninteresting character.
And I would just like\nto say a little bit
about the question\nwe had before,
because I have this also in my\npractice working a lot in Asia.
There's an extremely fear\nabout this old landscape,
that all kinds of\ndiseases come up.
And when you create a\nkind of new landscape,
we often mix this up.
But in reality, to create\na new landscape in a city
is quite safe.
We have no diseases,\nwe have not problems,
and we can also show that\nis really much more healthy.
So I like these two points in\nyour observation, in your talk,
and I would just\nlike how you feel
about this atmosphere, this\ndifference of the nature we
somehow lost, the melancholy\nwe have with that,
and this kind of new approach\nabout the built nature, which
has a totally different\ncharacter-- which
has probably very much future?
I think the real challenge\nis that they have to accept
a new way of looking at nature.
We cannot use the notion\nwe have been using before.
But of course, emotionally\nwe are attracted.
And we have a difficult language\nto express what we emotionally
feel when we feel something.
So what I call the\naesthetic sense of nature
is this inner feeling you have.
And its about, how do we\ndeal with a new nature
to raise that\nfeeling inside you?
And I don't think\nit's the visual,
because we have other senses.
And it's not about\nhow things look,
it's about how you feel\ninside, in your stomach.
And you can react on that\non many different levels.
I see my job, or\nmy work, or this
is what I'm aiming at,\nto evoke that feeling.
And what kind of\ntools do I have?
This is what I do here.
I'll try to explain about.
But we struggle a long time,\nfor many, many years to--
now I show primary projects\nin Copenhagen and Denmark.
I couldn't do that 10 years ago.
They were laughing at me.
Two years ago, we\nhad a corporation--
the municipality of Copenhagen.\nThey wanted urban nature.
So I said, no, no.
Not urban nature.
Urban and nature is\ntwo different things,
so there's nothing\ncalled urban nature.
That's something new that\nnever existed before.
And that's interesting.
This is when nature\nbecome visible, or become
present in an urban context.
It's not the trees\nthat is cut, it's
not the small flowers show\nthe tarmac and all that.
This is all done in the\nbuilt environment thinking.
When we talk about\nnature in the city,
it's about nature and\nhow nature order works.
So we had all our\nprojects in the beginning.
We have to take out\nthe curve trees,
it should all be vertical,\nand be no branches,
because everyone\ncould walk into them.
And I said, this is the point.
This is when you walk in the\nforest, you always get hurt.
So the thinking of the presence\nof what nature do to you,
it become much more\na weirdness about it.
So now the next step is,\nhow does it look then?
We have in Copenhagen-- this\nis from the faculty we just
finished for the health--
university of health.
And it was really difficult\nto discuss with them
to have real nature outside.
I mean, they all have their\nanalyzes, reports, PhD
students, a lot of things\nthat improve evidence
that the more green you have\nthe more healthy you become.
It still is difficult. And\nit's because you have people--
most of us have\nstill an impression
of how it should look like.
But the conditions for that\nis not existing anymore.
This is also why I think\nit's interesting to show
the damage the new climate\ndoes, because we only
see it as a threat.
But it's a fact, it's here.
So we have to find out,\nwhat can we learn from that
in order to make\na new design that
can make us understand\nthat we are part
of that, which is a threat?
It's because of the\nway we organize us.
It's because of\nthe way we build.
We have to find a new way to do\nit, otherwise we just continue.
I never understood\nwhy an area that
had been destroyed of\nsome climatic catastrophe
is rebuilt to the\nsame level as before.
I see it's complete stupid.
It's going to happen again.
And I think this is\nmaybe what we are seeing
in some of these projects.
That there is a mental\nchange, that now we
try to do it different.
And then we see\nthe consequences.
And of course, understand\nthat if there's too much water
and we doesn't control\nit in the right way,
it can become diseases.
It can also come diseases in\nthe trees, and everything else.
But the whole society\nis full of diseases.
We have to be more aware\nabout what we do this time,
than we have been previous time.
I don't know if--
I tried to follow that.
Thanks for the lecture.
I have a-- I guess a somewhat\nstraightforward question.
But I wonder--
Could you raise your arm?
I don't know where\nyou are sitting.
Over here.
Sorry.
I was wondering, how do\nyou determine what is grown
and what is built?
And is there\nactually a difference
in how this distinction\nmight be useful in this time
of new nature or\nthe Anthropocene?
The grown environment\nfollow the order of nature.
And the built environment follow\nthe order of construction,
geometry, and hierarchy--
something is thought.
Something artificial\nthought, Cartesian thinking.
And nature is a system,\nwhere everything is--
it acts with each other.
And if you use your\nbuilt environment--
traditional and\narchitectural thinking--
on nature, then it becomes\nthe built environment.
This is what we have\nseen for many years.
This is the way we\nput trees in rows.
This is how we make\nthem all the same.
This is how we cut them.
So I'm talking about that they\nfollow the order of nature,
they grow.
So you mentioned that\nnature is a system,
and it follows a kind of--
Yeah, you can say architecture\nis more like a structure.
But I guess-- do you think\nlandscape architects are
capable of systemic thinking?
I don't know, I'm just\nexplaining what I'm doing.
I have a quick question.
So as you're practicing--
you are practicing globally.
So how do you deal\nwith those places
where you don't\nhave experiences?
Say it again, please.
I missed it.
How do you deal with those\nplaces, new projects,
where you don't have experiences\nbasically in new nature?
I guess, like you said,\nexperiences matters.
So when you get\ninto a place, you
want to have something inside\nto have this kind of moment
that you want to\nbring to a people.
But when you have a project in\ntotally different environments
than a Scandinavian\ncountry, how do
you get the experience to your\ndesign that you want to show?
I guess you're also asking\nthe different cultures?
This is one of the reasons--
I guess it's not\nabout a culture.
It's more about the philosophy--
like, you talk about\nhow people are thinking
about trees, or like those\nkind of fundamentally different
understanding of the nature.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
So I guess in your\nDenmark project,
do you think you\nstarted your design
thinking from the experiences.
But in other places, you may try\nto get into the design solution
through forms.
I still think it's\nalso a cultural issue.
And being able to\nunderstand the different
cultures a way of\nlooking at nature.
You have to go\ninto that, and this
is one of the reasons\nwe work very closely
together with anthropologists.
I like the way you started the\nlecture from the very beginning
of the--
some fundamental\nfact of the universe.
And that's where we can find\ncommon ground then to talk.
I thought the\nlecture was terrific.
Thank you so much.
But I wonder--
I worry a little bit that your\nvocabulary isn't discriminating
enough, old versus new nature,\nto help us identify or think
about how to deal with\ndifferent situations.
And here's an example.
I belong to--
I live in Somerville,\nMassachusetts, a neighboring
city.
And I belong to a community\ngroup that successfully
sued IKEA, at great expense\nand with great anxiety,
over IKEA's wish to build a new\nstore on the mystic waterfront,
thereby subtracting\na significant amount
of the very little public open\nspace that we have in the town.
And IKEA's argument was\nthat it could build up
a perfectly respectable public\npark on top of its parking
garage.
And we did some research\nand came back and said, no,
you can't.
And it was a difficult case.
We nearly lost.
And, you know, I could imagine\nthe IKEA team coming back
now, having heard your lectures\nand saying, new nature, look!
We're living in a new world,\nforget about your concerns
about public open\nspace on the river.
This is going to create\ngreat economic growth
for Massachusetts.
Look at all the\nsales tax revenue.
And we lose our case.
So have you ever confronted\nsituations like that?
I mean, how do you help people\nthink about the trade-offs
involved in building green\non concrete, versus--
or in and around\nconcrete-- versus trying
to preserve pristine public\nspaces for other kinds of uses?
IKEA also wanted to\nbuild a warehouse right
in the center of Copenhagen.\nThey have developed smaller
warehouses, so you can shop\nthere without driving in
with your big car.
And it was parallel to\nthe harbor of Copenhagen,
and we have done the overall\nplan for this long promenade
with office buildings.
The city dune is the\nfirst space in that row.
And there was no space\nfor building in there,
on this site IKEA\nwanted to build.
And I had meetings with\nthem, and explain them
that we could actually\ndo similar projects
that I showed you here\ntoday together where
they are building.
And as you probably know, that\nthey have a concept for how
they do buildings that cannot\nbe changed, wherever they build.
But this was on the roof, so of\ncourse that was a possibility.
So they asked someone\nelse to do it.
Now there's no roof garden.
But they get permission.
So it's all over again.
We tried another one,\nand so and so on.
But I think-- as I finished\nalso my talk, this civil society
action, I think,\nis very important.
Because this is what\nI can see today.
That's we all civilian\ngo together and interfere
in the process of all\nthe politicians, the more
influence we can get to have\nactually that society we
ask for.
I see it recently, in\ntwo different cases
in Copenhagen. Where the\nlast part of an area--
open land-- five meters\nfrom the city center,
which is enormous space\nthat haven't been built.
And they both\ndecided 10 years ago,
in this specific spot--\nvery, very little.
Very small.
Maybe 1/5 of the whole area.
There was people discovering\nthis basic kind of flowers.
And it raise an opinion\nagainst building on that site,
even though it was decided\n10 years ago to build there,
and it changed the\npoliticians decision.
Now they're going to find\nanother way, another place
to build.
It wouldn't have\nhappened 10 years ago.
It happens today.
And I think this is where\nit's enormous power in having
the foundation\nformulate for creating
this kind of livable places--
grown environmental,\nas I call it--
within the cities.
So please, do it again.
Well I think Sig just\nanswered my question about--
well first of all, thank you.
I'm here.
Yeah, I see you.
Well, thank you so much for--
it's a very timely presentation,\nbecause of the way that I
understood it, it is actually\nvery productive provocation
in questioning things\nthat we take for granted.
And as you do that, and\nyou are brave enough
to claim for that--
for this looking for the\nuncanny, for the unquestioned--
I also think that\nyou may face also
step backs from the regulatory\nstandpoint from city officials
that--
because they're going\nthrough their regulations,
they have to do things\nas the status quos,
just focusing and\nbuilding the way
that they have been building.
So did you ever\nencounter these moments
where you have to educate or\nto further discuss projects
in order to produce\nyour own visions,
to go against the status quos?
What is your technique\nin shaping that?
I think we managed to have a\nteam where everyone is standing
up for that, and never give up.
This project have really\nbeen difficult to realize,
and it was two people in the\noffice working day and night
on site to explain to\npeople how to plant.
So you could say\nalmost idealistic.
Which is a difficult position\nto have when you run a business.
But yeah.
There's no really technique.
Well the technique\nis to adjust to it,
and have a very precise goal.
What are you going for?
And we have a strong\nrelationship inside the team,
so you know everything you\ndo is the right direction,
and then skip the other things--
priorities.
But I can also show projects\nthat doesn't work very well.
Hi, over here.
[inaudible] I'm\ncurious to hear how
other communities\noutside of Denmark
have received your proposals,\nother than Danes and Parisians,
who are very receptive to the\nnew nature of [? stanport. ?]
I'm wondering whether\nyou have any visions
for executing these kinds\nof projects outside.
I know you mentioned\nthe Middle East,
and you had an\nexhibition in Beijing,
but what about rather\nthan just an installation
actually incorporating it\ninto the permanent structures
in these other countries?
We have a lot of\nprojects in Norway.
And the first ones are\nnow under construction.
The one in Paris is\ninteresting because Hidalgo,
the mayor of Paris,\nin her speech, when
we won the competition,\nshe was not talking so much
about landscape architecture.
She was talking about what\ndoes this kind of project
mean, in the sense of social\nrelationship between people?
We have three projects in China,\ntwo of them is small parks,
and been received--
worked together with\nChinese, works very well.
The other projects, different\nplaces we're working now is
in the beginning phase, so I\ncannot answer you directly.
But I can see that the way\nwe think, the way we approach
works very well together\nwith the local culture
and communities.
Did they seek you out?
Sorry?
Do they seek you out,\nor you seek them out?
Yeah, when it's\ncompetition, of course,
then we have to compete on it.
I would say that as\nmore and more people
from outside coming\nto us and asking
if we can do similar\nthings together with them.
For different cultures,\ndifferent nations.
We have time for\none more question.
Hi.
I had a question about\nwhen you differentiate
between built form and\nthe grown environment,
and that the grown\nenvironment involves processes
that require landscape\narchitecture to take
on a different model\nof representation.
Because we are talking\nabout temporal changes.
And in your work, as you\nget into building diversity
and building\ncomplexity and form,
we are still tied to the\nconventions and the softwares
that the built\nenvironment has developed.
So when you do develop\nyour planting plans,
given the concept of you trying\nto cultivate this wilderness,
how specific do you get in\nterms of your planting plan?
And how do you start working\nwith contractors on site who
are not used to the\nway in which you--
in the way the industry wills?
On this project\nhere, for instance.
To maintain this project--
this is [inaudible] Park.
This was a park before.
Now we are changing\nit so it becomes
what they call a climate park.
Because we have to handle\nall the water in this area.
In order to maintain\nthis, all the employees
in the municipality of\nthe maintenance department
have to be re-schooled,\notherwise they can't do it.
So it happens step by step.
I cannot just stand up and\nsay you have to all learn
a different way.
It takes some time, and they\nhave to do some failure,
and then they find\nout how to do it.
That means that we have to be\nin the project for a longer time
than you usually will be.
So we have this EU system that\nall services are caught up
in pieces, and you have\nto compete on each one.
So it makes it very difficult\nto develop something which
is not already determined.
So there will be a part--\nwhen this project is coming
to being finished\nin construction,
it becomes visible for everyone.
Its more and more needed\nthat the people who
is going to maintain\nit have to be learning
a different way\nof what is beauty,
and what is the aim of\nwhat we are doing here.
Because they are not\ngoing to cut the trees,
or to take off branches\nand things like that.
They have to develop the\nexpressions of matter,
not the expression of form.
That's completely\ndifferent from--
it takes time.
OK, thank you, Stig.
