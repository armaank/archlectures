Hello, everyone, sorry\nthat I had to interrupt
this beautiful soundtrack.
My name is Sylvia Benedito.
I'm a associate professor\nhere in the landscape program,
but I'm also a co-coordinator of\nthe Art, Design, and the Public
Domain with Krzysztof Wodiczko.
It is a with great\npleasure to host
and introduce James\nWelling tonight.
And perhaps pleasure is a good\nword and an appropriate term
to use for further discussion.
Mr. Welling is joining us in\nthe context of the Rouse's
Visiting Artist Program.
He's the last in this\nseries and perhaps,
the most intensely connected\nwith what we do here
at school--
not only in\nprojecting, and making,
fabricating otherly worlds but\nalso in working with the built
environment and the various\nlayers in this world that we
all inhabit--
time, color, architecture,\nlandscape architecture, light,
memory, and the\ndifferent publics
as subjects and matters.
And all of them,\nin James work, they
coalesce in unsettling ways.
Opening last year's program,\nor this year's program,
we heard Luisa\nLambri, a photographer
focused on the evanescent\ndimension of landscape
and architecture.
We heard also Iwan Baan, a\nphotographer particularly
focused on the built environment\nand the ways that people
inhabit the space that\nwe fabricate and build.
We also heard Liam Gilick,\na multidisciplinary artist
known for his multiple\ncollaborations with architects
and also known for his own\narchitectural installations.
And now, we are very happy\nto host James Welling, hoping
to trigger everyone's\nimagination with what
Sylvia Lavin wonderfully\ndescribed as an intoxicating
qualities of the\ndance color field.
The way that I read James\nWelling's body of work--
and I mean literally a\nbody with different parts--
is that it's exploratory, and\nwithout a preestablish end
or result, therefore, is\nin itself improvisational
but metalogical and precise.
Scenes are set as\nframes in which
phenomena and the\nhappenstance of the phenomena
is taking place.
In different words,\nJames sets the context--
the way that I read it-- it\nsets contexts as platforms
for larger questions\nto emerge and appear--
questions perhaps situated on\nan environmental, political,
questions of translation\nand interpretation.
And each photo is a\nquestion in itself.
There is something also\nvery visceral in Jame's
photographic work,\nas they produce
a simutaneous 10 years\nnausea as if we are
sugar loaded and attraction.
Likewise, I like the\nidea of poisonous honey.
Welling's works makes\natmosphere appear
as a thick medium in an\nuncanny and predictable manner,
reminding us of the world\nand the air we live within.
This thick medium,\nthis atmosphere,
coalesces and binds features\nof landscape architecture
and often the brutal structures.
This one seem redeeming against\ntheir hosting environments.
And the great gradients\nof color present
in the work, James\nWelling reminds us
that the air we breathe is made\nof various layers, densities,
temperatures, velocities, and\nscents in its vertical section.
As a big admirer of the\navant garde filmmakers,
and we were talking\nabout that-- how
I love the work of Nathaniel\nDorsky and James Hiler.
I see Jame's photographic\nwork as a choreography
of time in thickness,\nwhere imagination
works with\nincompleteness, and where
stories or impressions\nby different people
are coalesced and accumulated--
likewise, a diary.
James has a work\ncalled Diary/Landscape.
It's very beautiful.
As mentioned, James Welling\nwork is a body of many works--
meaning that James began to work\nin watercolor and painting--
being deeply influenced\nby Charles [inaudible]..
After this, James\nstudied modern dance
at University of Pittsburgh,\nparticipating also
in various performance.
So this idea of performance\nand performative space
perhaps gets also captured\nmostly in the photographic work
of James.
Associated with his projects\non mobile sculpture, James
worked with super 8 films\nand later digital video,
where he started also to\nexplore existing infrastructure
factories, architectural\nfeatures, and color
as subject matter.
He has worked and exhibit\ninternationally from LA
to London, New York to Basel,\nHannover to Oslo, Vienna
to Paris, just to\nname a very few.
He also worked at the\nArchitecture and Design
department at MOMA--
[inaudible] we were\ndiscussing-- taught briefly
at MIT, Bard College.
And later, he became the\nhead of photography area
in the Department\nof Art at UCLA.
And here, he embraced\nanother medium,
bringing in other parts-- this\nbody of work, the photograms,
working directly with\nfilm, film as a skin that
registers light and process.
And currently, he's teaching\nat Princeton University.
James Welling's\nlatest exhibition
was held at Chicago\nArchitecture Biennial this year
created by our faculty, Mark\nLee and Sharon Johnston.
Dedicated to the topic,\n"Make New History,"
he was also invited to\nphotograph Chicago's fabric--
in particular, Mies van der\nRohe, I-80 Campus, and the Lake
Shore Drive apartments.
And I also very happy that\nto know that he's currently
working, again, in video\nas a potential new series
of special explorations.
Without further ado, please\nwelcome James Welling.
[applause]
Thank you for that introduction.
It's a little intimidating to\nbe here in a graduate school
of architecture because I'm--\neven though I'm a big fan
of architecture, I know very\nlittle about a lot of things.
So tonight, I'm going to talk\nabout my photographs from a--
how they emerge\nin my imagination,
and how I created them.
And there are a lot of--
I know there's a game called\nChutes and Ladders, where
worm holes, one thing,\nwill pop up 20 years later.
And in my work, there's\na lot of back and forth
between different parts of\nthat body that was referred to.
I'm not going to show--
I'm going to leave out some big\nparts of my photographic ouvre,
because I want to\ntalk about this idea
of pathological color, which is\nthe title of a class I taught
at UCLA, and I'm now\nteaching at Princeton.
And pathological color comes\nfrom Goethe's Theory of Color.
He talks about the physiological\ncolor, normative of color.
And then in the appendix,\nhe has a section
on pathological color,\nwhich for him is--
it's color blindness or\ncertain abnormalities
in the organ of sight.
I originally thought\nI would start out
by showing my black and\nwhite pictures from the '70s.
But then I realized that\nmy first photographs
that I made when I seriously\ncommitted to thinking of myself
as a photographer in\n1975 after spending
undergrad and graduate school\nworking in painting, video,
performance art, modern\ndance, I committed
to be working seriously\nin photography in 1975
with pictures like this--
Polaroid photographs-- that\nI heated over a gas stove
to get the intensity\nof that red.
And this one, I\nrefrigerated it when
it was processing to\nmake it the cold blue
of the fluorescent lights\nin my studio even colder.
And this hands on,\nworking with color,
was something that I really\nenjoyed about Polaroid.
But eventually, I wore\nit out, and moved on
to black and white photography.
I'm often referred to as\na conceptual photographer,
and I think that name has been\nattached to me because people,
when they describe what\nI do or don't really
know how to deal\nwith the expanse
of the different projects.
But I'm very much interested\nin the actual making
of photographs.
And when I bought a\nnew camera in 1976,
I began to work\nwith architecture.
Because for me, the camera has\na similarity to buildings--
it's the front and the\nback, the rising front.
The view camera was\nvery, very well-suited
to making architectural\nphotographs.
So without really knowing much\nabout architecture but being--
I was very fond of\nthese generic stucco
buildings in Los Angeles,\nwhere I was living at the time.
I dragged my camera around\non my bike and took pictures.
This particular photograph, I'd\nread that a red filter would
turn the sky dark, so\nI bought a red filter
and was very excited.
I made this sky\nkind of Ansel Adams.
Ansel Adams' dark gray.
I was also excited\nto learn that if you
open your lens for\ntwo minutes at f-16,
you could make a\nphotograph like this.
And in Los Angeles, there are\nonly two types of weather.
There's day and night.
You have sun, and then, you have\nthe unchanging street lights.
So I made a number of pictures\nby street light, which was--
it was great because\nyou just open the lens
and counted to 220.
This photograph, I\nparticularly like the shadows--
the kind of stucco box shapes.
It was always in\nmy mind, somehow
associated with what I\nthought of as the Bauhaus
without really knowing\nmuch about the Bauhaus.
It seemed to have something to\ndo with architecture and light
and space.
I moved to New York shortly\nafter that photograph
and spent a year struggling,\ndidn't really know
how to deal with New York City.
The city was very difficult\nto make 4 by 5 pictures in.
So I sort of went internal for\na number of four or five years
and made studio photographs.
And this is a picture from\na group of photographs
that I started in\n1980, continued
for a year and a half.
The photographs\nthemselves are very small.
They are 4 by 5\ninch contact prints.
And the architecture\nphotographs of LA
and the next two groups of work\nalso are very small pictures.
I was interested in that very\nintense viewing experience--
these scintillations of\nlight, the chaos, and form,
formlessness, but\nstill very precise.
So I'd like that tension between\nyou don't know what it is--
it's actually aluminum foil--
but it's still totally\nsharp and clear.
So that tension between--
you can see what it\nis, but you don't
know what it is--\nwas something that I
became very interested in.
And this was about the time\nthat the so-called Pictures
Generation was forming.
A lot of those\npractitioners were
interested in using photography\nbut somehow critiquing it.
And even though I tagged\nalong like a sibling,
I wasn't so much interested\nin critiquing photography
as trying to\nunderstand what it was.
And this was the architecture\nof photographs in LA.
And these pictures were\nthese foundational level
of my thinking about\nphotography ground zero.
A related project.
I took a kind of cheap velvet--\nit's called drapery fabric--
and dusted it with pastry dough\nthat would make baklava out of.
Or in this case, I was\nworking at a restaurant making
shepherd's pie, some\nsort of pastry dish.
And these photographs are, for\nme, still deeply mysterious.
I know what I did, but I\ndon't know what I was doing.
But the important\nthing for me was
that the shallow space\nof these studio pictures.
This kind of 1 or 2 feet deep.
Also, a relation to product\nphotography-- photographing
objects on a seamless backdrop.
So this is knox gelatin\nthat I poured ink into.
I was very surprised\nto learn, when
I was reading about photography,\nthat all photographs are
composed of gelatin--
gelatin silver print.
Even colored paper has gelatin\nas the binder or the medium.
So I wanted to make\nphotographs with gelatin,
which I tongue in cheek\ncalled gelatin photographs.
These are all black\nand white prints
that I would make\nin the darkroom.
At this point, color\nreally wasn't an option.
I didn't understand how\ncolor photography worked.
I didn't know that you\ncould go and rent a darkroom
and make color prints.
It was all something\nthat a lab did.
So I was deeply involved in\njust thinking about photography
as a black and white medium.
While I was making those\ngelatin photographs,
I got a job at the Museum of\nModern Art as an art handler.
And I worked in the architecture\nand design department.
And when they discovered\nthat I was a photographer,
I was assigned to take pictures\nof design objects like this.
This is not my photograph.
I looked online yesterday,\nand all of the '80s pictures
have been replaced by-- this\nmust be a new digital file.
I photographed this\nOlivetti computer.
I also photographed a number\nof posters like this by--
try to remember his name--
Biele.
And occasionally, I'd work in\nthe Mies van der Rohe Archive.
And I photographed that\nBismarck Memorial on top,
although it's not\nmy photographs.
Someone else.
It must be the new\ndigital version.
And occasionally I'd\nphotographed drawings
when the archivist\nneeded someone
to help out with the\ndocumenting all the drawings.
And this is, of course, a\nfamous detail of the IIT corner.
So working in the A&D\ndepartment at MoMA,
I'd looked in the files,\nand I became very interested
in the architecture\nof HH Richardson.
Growing up in Hartford\nand in the suburbs,
you'd see a lot of Richardson,\nor Richardsonian, buildings.
And I had really wanted to\nget back out of the studio,
so I purchased a book.
The Complete\nRichardson Buildings
had just been published\nby Jeffrey Ochsner.
And so, I got the book, and\nit had all the addresses.
So I packed up my\ncameras and went out
to-- this is in Newton.
This is the manual\nof Baptist Church.
University of Vermont.
Amos Memorial Town\nHall in North Easton.
This is actually a\nsculpture or project
by Olmsted called The\nRockery, which is to me,
one of the great 19th\ncentury earthworks.
You just walk over this\npath over this arch,
and it gives you a view\nof Richardson's town
hall in the distance.
A Richardson project.
It was completed after he died.
And then, of course, you\nwant on this building.
I showed it to a friend\nof mine, Joel Wax, who's
a councilman in Los Angeles.
And he hated this\npicture because he
had studied at the Austin Hall.
He's like, why would you want\nto take a picture of that?
And then, Ken and\nI visited this.
This is the Stoughton\nhouse on Brattle.
It's actually one house away\nfrom Philip Johnson's Ash
Street House, which\nis kind of a nice--
the confluence of\nJohnson and Richardson
just separated by\none building lot.
In 1998, I became really\ninterested in color.
So I thought about it.
I knew that there\nwas something to do
with the red, green, and\nblue sensors in our eyes.
I discovered that in 1861,\nJames Clerk Maxwell had created
the first color photograph.
And it was of a Scottish tartan.
He used black and white film\nwith some sort of glass vials
with red, green,\nand blue liquids,
and photographed\nthe tartan, and then
did a slide projection piece\nto create his color photograph.
So this idea of trichromatic\nvision, trichromatic sensors
in our eyes, trichromatic\nbulbs in the projector
is the basis for all\ncolor photography.
It's actually not\nhow the brain works.
The brain has hardware for\nred, green, and blue receptors.
But when you actually get into\nit, it's much more complicated.
But for the purposes\nof understanding
how color\nreproductions are made,
color photographs, red, green,\nand blue trichromatic structure
is the basis for\ncolor photography.
In 2005, I gave a lecture on\nAndy Warhol's Shadow paintings.
And I saw these paintings\nand Warhol's project--
a painter, actually,\na photographer
who wants to escape the red,\ngreen, and blue structure.
For me, Warhol\nbecame an artist who
was trying to get\noutside of that RGB.
And the shadows were a way\nof selecting color, choosing
color.
And in the case of the shadows,\nWarhol sampled fiesta ware
and that became\nhis color palette.
And in a way, this\nexample of Warhol
would come back later in\nsome of my other projects.
And after giving\nthat Warhol lecture,
I had a kind of\nunderstanding of how
I could make a photograph that\ndiagrammed or demonstrated
the RGB characteristics\nof color film.
And I set up my view camera on\na windy day in November of 2005
and photographed shadows as they\nmoved across these succulents.
And I made 6 exposures--
red, green, and blue,\nand just to be careful,
I did cyan, magenta, yellow.
So I called them hexachromes.
So wherever there\nis color, that's
where a filter was placed\nin front of the lens--
sequentially, 6 exposures in\nthe same piece of film, where
there is no vibrant color.
That's where the\nlight was constant.
So this was a big\nbreakthrough for me
in terms of taking\na knife and cutting
into that fabric of\nour color perception.
And what that led to were\na couple of assignments.
One was to photograph--
and this is not a\npicture of a case study.
"One or Two" in Los Angeles.
It was going on the market,\nand a number of photographers
were invited to photograph it.
So I photographed Craig\nElowitz's case study one or two
using trichromatic filters.
And then, I visited\nthe Farnsworth House
and used that same process\nof sequential exposures.
And it actually-- turned out,\nit wasn't very successful
because there wasn't much wind.
It was kind of--
nothing was really changing.
So I made some\npictures like this
and thought about the process.
And then, as I was\nstudying these pictures,
I received a phone call\nfrom the photo editor
of New York Magazine, Jody\nQuon, to photograph the Philip
Johnson Glass House.
She had seen these pictures, and\nshe was interested in someone
to take pictures of\nthe Glass House--
probably the most photographic\nmodernist house in America--
for the reopening in 2007 when\nit would open to the public.
So I visited the\nGlass House, realized
that the trichromatic multiple\nexposure technique wasn't
going to work with this.
So I began to take the filters\nthat I brought and placed them
in front of the lens and made\npictures like this and this.
The pictures were published.
And then, I went back\nfor three more years
photographing the Glass\nHouse and the notorious Lake
Pavilion, which is a\nkind of miniature temple.
And the curious thing about\nworking chromatically this way
is that I would bring filters\nor diffraction gratings.
And I would think of just very--
arbitrary colors took\nplace in front of the lens,
and then they have an\nemotional resonance.
And the Theory of\nColor, Goethe talks
about how blues are depressing\nwhen you look at the landscape
through a blue filter,\nor it looks majestic
when you look at it\nwith a red filter.
So there is this\nwhole dialogue--
of course, the Claude\nglass, where artists
would look at the landscape\nthrough a monochrome filter
to simplify the tones.
Actually, a large body of\nliterature in painting around
the use of colored filters,\nwhich I discovered when
I was making these pictures.
And I was switched over\nto using a digital camera.
These are all Canon 5D\npictures with few exceptions.
These were all done in camera.
No, as it were Photoshop\npost-production,
apart from just lightning the\npicture to print it properly.
And what I enjoyed\nabout working this way
was I would set the\ncamera up on a tripod
and do dozens of variations.
And then, later choose the one\nthat seemed the most coherent.
When I was visiting\nthe Glass House
I met someone who\nsaid to me, you know,
I own a glass house in Paris.
It's called the\nMaison de Verre Maybe
you'd like to photograph it.
So on a trip to Paris,\nI visited this house,
which I guess it's\nvery hard to get into.
I remember as I approached\nthe door, a couple
of architectural students\nwere waiting for the doors
to open up so they could see it.
I found the Maison de\nVerre very grim, very dark.
And on the flight back, I\ndidn't shoot it with filters.
I photographed it the way an\narchitectural photographer
would render it.
But on the flight back,\nI began to experiment
with different\ncolor modulations.
And so, this project\non the Maison de Verre
became, for me, about taking\nthe color in the file,
and exaggerating it\nor amplifying it,
bringing it out using different\nvery simple Photoshop tools.
Intensifying that greens.
So this was a subset within\nthe Glass House project.
I was still working\non the Glass House.
This is actually a\nvery recent picture,
which does use layering and\nPhotoshop alterations that
were not in the original file.
And for me, this was\nan emblematic picture--
that bringing a piece of glass\nto look at what was behind me
was a way of building\nin multiple views
into this picture, that\nit was about the immediacy
of the experience to see\nbehind me and forward.
But I also realized that\none of the characteristics
of photography that's lost with\nthe transition into digital
is the inadvertent\ndouble exposure.
Of course, now you can\ndo that with a camera.
You can set it for\na double exposure,
but it doesn't have the\ncomplete randomness that
occurs when you\nrun a roll of film
through a camera that\nyou shot two weeks ago.
Of course, you can\ndo it again in post,
but I was very interested\nin what happens like this.
When I finished the\nGlass House project,
I wondered what to work on next.
And the experience of working\non the Maison de Verre
are those techniques that\nI developed, directed me
toward another project.
And that was a project\nabout the artist,
Andrew Wyeth, who is a\nsort of damned artist
in American history-- is kind\nof unclassifiable, notorious,
figurative painter who\nwas very important to me
when I was an adolescent.
And when I have exhibited this\nproject, a lot of my friends
sheepishly told me that\nthey also had admired Andrew
Wyeth when they were younger.
It's like part of a dark secret.
So in this project, I\nwent and photographed
the famous Olson\nHouse, which is now
owned by the Farnsworth Museum.
But I began to\nmake modifications.
I cut down the\ntrees on the left.
I removed a pine tree from\nthe front of the house.
I actually went in\nSeptember, and I was planning
to go back in the winter.
And I broke my foot and\nwasn't able to travel, so I--
this is actually the\nsnow from the Glass House
that I shoveled, or my\nassistant shoveled and placed
in the foreground\nof the Olson House.
So this project became not only\nabout looking at the places
that Andrew Wyeth had\nworked and mimicking some of
or doubling some\nof his paintings,
but also creating\nthings that hitherto
didn't exist in the picture\nand just amping up the color
or taking it down\nor desaturating it.
So in a way, it wasn't\nlike I was treading water.
But this project,\nI knew wouldn't--
I would not go and work on\nEdward Hopper's paintings,
for instance.
I would do something\nwith what I'd learned.
For me, beginning in\n2006 with the Glass House
and also with these\nWyeth pictures,
I printed my work with\nan inkjet printer.
And it's my feeling\nthat the Epson printer
is a different medium than\nthe analog chromogenic print
or darkroom print.
There's a kind of thickness to\nthe pigment in the Epson print
that I really enjoy.
And it aligns the process\nof making a photograph more
closely with offset printing.
So even though\nthis work is a sort
of homage to a painter\nand the surfaces
that Wyeth recorded\nin his paintings,
it's also about the\nprinting process.
As I was finishing\nthe Wyeth project,
I was invited to\nbe 1 of 10 artists
to take photographs of the\nMuseum of Modern Art Sculpture
Garden.
And probably because of\nmy interest in Johnson
and working on\nthe Glass House, I
was able to actually see that\nthis walkway across the water
was picked up from\nJohnson's front step.
Or maybe Johnson took the\nstone from the Sculpture Garden
and took it out to New Canaan.
Either way, there's a\nkind of correspondence
in a lot of Johnson's\nprojects with other things
that he was working on and how\nthey come back to his house.
And in any event, I\ndidn't feel that I
was the type of person to go\nand photograph the garden.
Tina Barney\nphotographed the garden.
Thomas Struth photographed it.
Lorna Simpson photographed it.
I wanted to work with\nexisting archival pictures--
working at MOMA and\nthe A&D department.
I'd seen that the museum has\nall of these wonderful pictures
from different events, projects\nthat were done in the garden.
So I went and looked\nthrough the archives
and began to select photographs.
This is Rafael Farrar.
It's ice sculptures\nthat he created.
It might have been for the\nInformation show in 1970 OK.
So I was working with\narchival pictures.
Then, I decided\nthat I would go back
to those same spaces with my\ncamera and make my own pictures
and then layer them on\ntop of each other perhaps?
But what I decided\nto do intuited
was that I could take\nthe MOMA archival image
and put it into the red\nchannel of a color document;
and take two of my own\npictures and put those
in the green and blue channels.
And I would get a picture\nthat look like this.
It would be a\nmultiple exposure--
that kind of inadvertent,\nrandom juxtaposition of three
images on top of each other.
And they would produce\na colored picture--
three black and\nwhite photographs.
This, of course, echoes back\nto Warhol, Rauschenberg,
artists who worked with\ncolored channels, who
worked with silkscreened.
Could the person who's\ntaking the pictures--
do have enough?
Because it's distracting.
Sorry?
Yeah.
OK, I'd be happy to-- we\ncan do it later if you want.
Because it's infrared sensor.
Anyway, so Rauschenberg-- a\nbig influence when I was young.
And this picture at\nthe Wadsworth Atheneum
is using imagery on\ntop of each other.
Something else that I became\nvery fascinated by as I
began to think about the process\nof making the sculpture garden.
Photographs was\npsychedelic photography.
And I remembered these\npictures by Richard Avedon.
So I went to the Avalon Studio\nand looked at the source images
and looked at Avedon's\ndye transfers--
how he tried to put it together.
So this was also a\nmultichannel, putting
black and white\npictures into RGB files.
This is a another Avedon\nproject from the same period.
Moon Drops.
When I was at the archive,\nthe archivist said,
you know about the\nMoon Drop photographs?
I said, no, I don't.
So this is a Avedon\nProject for Revlon.
And then, this is another\nAvedon photograph.
Similar era-- late '60s.
So these techniques variously\ncalled color solarization
are this, equidensity film.
The bottom picture, the\nback cover of Aladdin Sane
is the only example I can\nfind of a strange film
that Agfa produced\nin the '60s and '70s
called "Equidensity\nFilm," which would make up
color solarized image.
Turns out it's\nused for astronomy.
But this, the photographer\nfor Aladdin Sane
used it on the back cover.
So with these\nreferences in mind,
I got very excited about\nputting together three pictures
into color channels.
And when I look at\nthese photographs now,
they seem to me crude.
I can see the RGB channels.
They are not so transformed.
But anyway, I proceeded long.
I was very excited about\nwhat was happening.
As I said, the inkjet\nprints have this thickness.
So to me, the yellow\nin this photograph
is as if it's been rolled\non with a [inaudible]..
This was around 2014,\nand at the same time,
I was printing a book of my\nblack and white photographs.
And I went to a\nprinting company called
Meridian Printing in East\nGreenwich, Rhode Island.
And when you print a book,\nthere's a lot of down time.
It's like or 45 minutes to\n2 hours between signatures
where they set up the plates.
And then they run\nthe paper through,
and then they call you\nwhen the presses are ready.
But actually, what they're\ndoing when they're revving up
the press for each\nsignature is they're
printing on top of other\npreviously printed sheets
to save money.
These are called make-readies.
And so, on top of the\nstack of printed material
is a make-ready.
It's a superimposed two or three\nimages on top of each other.
It's a scrap sheet.
My father worked in\nthe printing business
called The Usable Scrap.
But make-ready is\na wonderful term
because it inverts\nDuchamp's ready-made.
You have the make-ready.
A number of artists\nhave used make-readies
like Dieter Roth, Walead\nBeshty, Susan Silton
have used him as works.
But for me, the make-ready\nwas a inspiration.
And I'm sure an inspired\nRauschenberg and Warhol
and other artists who\nhave been in the context
of a graphic arts factory.
So I went around\nMeridian taking pictures
and then slightly torqued the\ncolor so the blues and the Reds
popped out in unnatural ways.
And for me, going to the\noffset printing plant
was like going to the foundry\nor the forge of photography.
It's where all the colors live.
And a friend of mine\nwho's a musician
was talking about Beethoven\'s\n"Emperor Concerto"
when he said Beethoven's\ngreat because he uses
all the keys in the keyboard.
And with these new\npictures I was making,
I was realized I was using a lot\nmore color than you would use
in a conventional photograph.
So this is a small\nproject that's
embedded in the\nsculpture garden.
I went to the Wadsworth\nAtheneum in Hartford
and photographed in the\nmuseum using archival imagery.
And actually, these are\nall archival pictures.
I don't think they're\nany of my photographs.
I was told this--
it's working.
OK.
More Wadsworth.
So back to the sculpture garden.
So this is a picture\nof a performance
that Kusama did in 1965,\nwhere a bunch of performers
took their clothes off and\nfrolicked in the fountains.
And as I looked through\nthese MoMA archival pictures,
I began to seek out\nperformative images--
images of dance or performances\nor music concerts. --
and partly because\nof my interest
in remembering my one year I\ntook studying modern dance.
I became very interested\nin this picture,
and I wanted to remake not\nuse an archival picture,
but I wanted to\nsomehow recreate it.
So I got some of\nmy UCLA students,
and they'd studied dance\nin the dance department,
but they were visual artists.
So I worked with them\nfor four Saturdays,
and we took pictures\nin the studio.
And this is what I came up with.
And let me show\nyou the channels.
So this is actually the dancers\nmimicking Yvonne Rainer.
Image of a Yvonne Rainer\ndance in the middle.
On the same camera card, I had\nstarted to photograph brutalist
buildings by Marcel Breuer.
This is the IBM Research\nCenter in Boca Raton, Florida.
So that was the red channel.
The green channel is the\ndancer, and the blue channel
or some other dancers\nfrom my UCLA group.
And this is a actually a small\ndance company in Los Angeles
contemporary dance.
And here are the source images.
The middle picture is--
I went to San Francisco,\nused my cell phone
and photographed that department\nstore that Frank Lloyd
Wright designed in the '50s.
I forget the name of it.
And then the Breuer\nResearch Center.
And here is Paul Rudolph's\nOrange County office buildings
before they were torn down.
And this is the final picture.
So I was thinking a lot about\nthe idea of somatic experience.
Architecture and\ndance share interest
in somatic possibilities.
So I thought putting\narchitecture and dance together
seemed like a good fit.
They also became stage sets.
And not all of the\nimages use architecture.
The previous picture\nfrom Kyle Abraham,
I just layered three images\nof the dance with some cutouts
that I created.
And this is landscape imagery\nwith a French dance company
doing Merce Cunningham events.
CNDC [inaudible].
And then, I began to work with\nthe Los Angeles Dance Project
in LA.
Rehearsals and some\ndress rehearsals.
This was actually\nthis year in July.
So in May, I created\na one minute video
work called Metamorph for a\nshow called "Metaporphisis."
And so, this work--
I took a lot of the outtakes\nand put them together,
and I asked my brother\nto compose music for it.
So it's 60 seconds long.
[music playing]
That was presented in\nVienna on a monitor
in a storefront gallery\nwhere you could listen
to the music on your phone.
Two years ago, Mark and\nSharon Johnston Marklee
invited me to be part of the\nChicago Architecture Biennial.
And I was excited.
I asked to photograph Mies\nvan der Rohe buildings.
And I specifically\nasked to photograph IIT
because when I worked at the\nmuseum in the winter of 1986,
I went to Chicago to do\na show at feature gallery
and went out to\nIIT on a snowy day
and took 35 millimeter pictures.
So my participation\nin the biennial
included pictures\nthat I took in 2016
and '17 as well as photographs\nthat I made in 1986 and a trip
that I made in 2006.
So I was able to almost take my\nown pictures as archival images
and layer them together.
Partly as a result of the class\nthat I taught at Princeton
last year, I realized\nthat I could recreate
some of those techniques that\nAvedon had used for the Beatles
and for Moon Drops by\ntaking the same file
and placing an equal\ndensity object or gradient
map in between the two files.
And that would color\nparts of the image.
So I consciously tried to\nmimic what Avedon had done
and others had done with this\nsort of channel mixing, where
you would take a black and\nwhite file and process it
or printed in color,\nand then print
on top of it other colors\noutside of the RGB matrix
as it were.
In a similar way that Warhol and\nRauschenberg would take images,
monochrome silkscreen files and\nthen squeegee different colors
through them.
I was also inspired by Raoul\nUbac's bas relief pictures
from the 1930s and\nearly 40s, where
he would sandwich positive and\nnegatives on top of each other.
So in addition to\nusing gradient maps,
I'm using bas relief\ntechniques in the photographs
that I produced for the\nChicago Architecture Biennial.
And this picture,\nthe three channels--
1986, 2006, and 2016.
I think these are all three\nchannels are from 1986,
including the contact sheet\nin the bottom which mimics
the structure of the windows.
Also, the three different years.
Crown Hall.
And then, of course,\nI couldn't help
photographing the corners\nof the IIT buildings.
I have to say that I worked\nwith two different assistants
on this project--
John Luisa and Evan Whale.
And they also\ntraveled to Chicago
and took some of\nthe source pictures.
And I've used other people\non the dance projects.
They'll shoot a\ndance performance
that I can't get to, and then\nI'll work with the material.
But it really-- for\nme, it comes out
of this working with\narchival imagery.
So the Los Angeles\nDance Project,
two years ago worked\nwith two choreographers
named Gerard and Kelly.
And I met Gerard\nand Kelly when they
were graduate students at UCLA\nin the interdisciplinary studio
of Mary Kelly.
And I was interested in\ntalking to them about dance.
They eventually came to\ncreating a work called
modern living in\nthe Schindler House
using LA Dance Project dancers.
So this is modern living\nat the Schindler House.
And then they created\nit at the house.
So it was this kind\nof confluence for me--
a dance company that\nalready photographed
and a site that I'd\nalready photographed.
With some Kuzma globes\nfloating in the lake.
And this is a picture that\nI made a few years ago.
I put LA Dance Project in\nthe Farnsworth House in 2014.
And in 2017, Gerard and Kelly\nbrought LA Dance Project
or some of the dancers\nto the Farnsworth House.
So this was three years later.
This was a performance that\ntook place on September.
And then this is the\nlast series of images
to show you a few of\nthe transformations.
This is how it started--
with this dancer Julie\nChen actually in the house
with images of the deck.
And then, this is\nthe big final image.
So that's where I've arrived.
This is my most of\nmy most recent work,
so I would be happy to\nentertain questions.
[applause]
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Perhaps I can start.
Goes back to-- that's the\nposition that I have here.
It's like I allow\nmyself to do that.
There's the show of\nmedia and the techniques
that you go as you\nexperiment with media.
If I translate that into\narchitecture or to the work
that we do in the\nSchool of Design,
the issue of editing\nwhat we have done
is a very important one.
So perhaps I would like if\nyou could develop a little bit
this idea of editing.
When do you know\nthat it's too much,
or what are the criterias that\nyou also set up for yourself?
But the protocols that you\nset up also for yourself
when you work with three\nlayers four layers, what
do you decide to show versus\nwhat you decide to hide?
It's only with the dance\npictures and the MoMA Sculpture
Garden that I develop\nmultiple variations.
So it becomes-- but\nfirst, it was inventing.
Inventing is maybe\ntoo big of a term
but creating a workflow\nto put together the layers
to transform the color.
Because for me, the goal\nwould be to not to take it
as delivered when you\nenter the pictures--
it looks very garish\nand very ugly--
so the idea of transformation\nor metamorphosis of the image.
So where am I going with that?
So it started out three years\nago, the process of working.
And I only use a couple of\ndifferent tools in Photoshop.
And I'm not making\nany new tools.
I'm using enough presets, but\nI'm working with the software
as it's been created.
And then I'm stacking\nup different layers,
turning them on and off.
So it's a process of\nputting this flow together.
But one of the\nthings that I'm most
excited about working this way\nis that it's unpredictable.
And this is something\nthat I find for me.
Digital technology previously,\nit was about improving an image
or removing something or taking\nblemishes out or removing
telephone poles--
all of the corrective ideas.
But in this process, it's really\nabout something completely
unexpected, so\nthe color palettes
of the different photographs\ngoing radically different ways.
And they're ways that\nI don't understand.
And that's the thing that\nis most dynamic about it,
is that it'll go in one\ndirection or the other.
But no, I'm also wondering,\nthinking about the relation
with the client.
Definitely you have worked at,\nfor instance, the [inaudible]..
It's more an abstract.
It's a topical client.
And it seems to\nme that they were
developed during that phase.
In other phases that you have,\nthey're are more abstract.
Perhaps more to the point,\nwith less layering involved
onto that, less\napparent layering.
When, for instance,\nI see the work
that you are working\nwith a client,
it seems that it becomes\nalso more graphically
intense or more layered.
And I don't know if was my\nimpression, and I don't know.
I'm wondering if\nthe idea of working
with a client that\nis a person that has
also commercial objectives--
very clear versus [inaudible]\nis more abstract also starts
to give you other directions.
I don't do a lot of\ncommercial photography.
Now because I don't want to,\nbut I just I'm not hired.
But the project for\nNew York Magazine
was extremely liberating\nbecause my art
director, the photo editor,\nsaid, do whatever you want.
We want something\nthat is totally
does not look like\nanything that is going
to come out at the same time.
And the projects that\nI'm most happy with
or that I feel like I\nchallenged myself the most
is when the client gives me\ncomplete freedom, so that--
I'm trying to think\nof examples of--
the Sculpture Garden Project.
The client, the museum,\nit's the client--
they chose some pictures.
I don't think they\nchose, necessarily,
the ones that I\nwould have chosen.
But they chose ones\nthat were featured
the garden in ways that\nwere important to be
shown for the project.
Yeah, but the client--
I think this is a difference\nperhaps in the art
world and your\nworld-- that there
is less direct back and\nforth between the client
and the producer.
I will open up to the audience.
Any questions?
Yes?
Do you mind\nintroducing yourself?
My name is Matt I\nlive in Somerville,
and I decided to come\nto this lecture I
have a lot of\nquestions, but I'm just
going to narrow it down to one.
Did you prefer shooting\nwhen you shot 4
by 5 slide film or negative\nfilm [? with ?] for color?
I shot very little\ncolor materials.
Negatives, mostly.
Is that important?
Did you prefer slide\nor negative film?
Slides are very hard.
Challenging to-- you know.
Did you have a Selection\nthat you liked?
I'm sorry?
Did you have a particular\nlens that you used, or?
Now and then, or--
I like normal lenses.
No, I don't know.
I mean, it depends\non the project.
Today, I was shooting with a\nwide angle tilt-shift lens.
When I started out\ntaking pictures,
I had no idea what focal\nlengths represented.
I bought a--
I just grabbed the\nfirst lens that I saw.
It's a very\ninexpensive Kodak lens.
I could still use.
It it's actually slightly wide.
It worked really well.
But there's a way that\nwhen you go forward
in the world starting\nout, you don't really
know what these tools are.
In a way, when I was younger,\nI had so much more energy
to explore what this particular\nlens or this type of film
represented because it was\nabsolutely unknown to me.
But I'm really not a tech.
Even though I may\nonly talk about things
that are technical,\nI don't really
care about that in\nany important way.
I am now able to financially\nbuy expensive equipment,
but it's absolutely\nmeaningless in terms
of what the artist does.
Hi.
Is it my turn?
No, no, your turn.
Yes.
Hi.
We've got someone\nin back, Christoff.
Oh.
You can go ahead though.
You are referring to\nWarhol and Rauschenberg?
Mm-hmm.
How about-- I am wondering if\nyou have any dialogue with Dan
Graham was his glass pavilions\nand also video architecture?
Dan Graham was\nsomeone I met when
I was really young, very young.
And he introduced me to the\nidea of many architectural ideas
for sure.
And his pavilions, and the idea\nof transparency and mirrors,
it actually--
I've kind of erased\nDan from my influences
probably incorrectly.
But there's a way\nthat-- for Dan,
is about a kind of\nneutrality or transparency.
I don't associate Dan's\nwork with hallucination or--
there's a way that the\nwhole conceptual art
has a kind of grayness to it.
And that, at least for me--
it may actually not--
but that was the\nway I interpret it.
So I had to go\noutside toward Avedon.
I'm sure Dan had those\nAvedon posters in his room
when he was growing up.
But the history of\ncolor photography
as is understood today\ncompletely excludes
psychedelia.
And this is what I want to\ntry to bring back-- is this,
the artist who worked\nwith those processes--
Rauschenberg and\nWarhol, of course
are very mainstream\nbut there are
a lot of lesser\nknown photographers,
and graphic artists, book\nartists who worked with--
Dieter Roth being one\nof the better examples--
who worked with a lot\nof these processes.
So I'm trying to\nbring them back.
Question back here.
Yes, hi, I'm Lucy Kim.
I'm an artist and\nassistant professor
of painting at\nBoston University.
And my question had\nto do with the way
you merge color in photography\nwith images of dancers.
And on the one hand,\nI mean, I'm really
intrigued because there seems to\nbe an interesting contradiction
where there's a reference\nto-- not reference-- but there
is a allusion to expressiveness,\nor it is expressive
because of dance and the way the\ncolors interact in your photos
and also physiology.
So optics in the body, and that\nwas what I was interested in.
Anything you say about that?
[inaudible]
I think dance is a\nspecial case of theater
where there's no dialogue.
There is a kind of\npsychological dimension,
but it's not embodied in\nthe way that a photograph
of a person on the street or a\nTablo or a set-up photograph.
It's a kind of special case\nin the history of photography,
people like Jeff Wall or--
trying to think of other--
Paul Graham or even street\nphotographers as a way
that the human\nsubject is portrayed.
And the viewer, then, reads\na psychological dimension
or narrative into the picture.
So I realized that by\nworking with dance imagery,
I was not as bound by those\npsychological interpretive
or intuitive or\nprojections, and that I
could work with\nthe human subject
bodies, expressive elements, but\nI wouldn't be necessarily tied
to a narrative.
Of course, this is\none of the things
that Merce Cunningham\nbrought in,
was the anti-narrative in dance.
I mean, I don't buy\nthat as something
that is the be all and end\nall of dance or expressive
movement.
But as a photographer,\nin my particular world,
it was a way that I could engage\nwith human subjects, bodies,
people that-- it wouldn't\nbe read narratively.
Yes.
Looking at that picture you\ngot on the screen, though,
have you ever felt tempted to\ngo back to your earliest roots
and actually start combining\npaint with the printed image?
Because it looks rather\ntempting to start
playing with washes and things\nover an image like that.
Oh, I think about it.
But it's also-- one\nof the important ideas
that I have to contribute\nis that the dialogue for me
is not so much between\npainting and photography
as between photography\nand graphic art,
which is a lower art.
One of my friends said\nthis looks like graphics.
That was like a criticism.
Not to me.
I'm Hartman Austin.
I teach at Boston College.
I'm also a painter.
How do you decide on\nthe scope of a project?
I mean, when do you get\ntired of the Glass House, or?
I think from many artists,\nthere's an arc to a project.
When you start out, you\nmake that first thing,
that's very exciting.
Then you try to\nmake another one,
and then it's a\ncomplete abject failure.
And then you try\nto figure out what
it was about that first\none that was actually--
and so, you discern\nthe rules of what
this project would include.
But the Glass House, I\nwent with film cameras.
I went with slide film.
I went with negative film.
I went with video cameras.
I made colored prints.
I went back in the darkroom.
I tried to make\ndarkroom manipulations.
I tried everything.
It turned out there was\nonly one path forward.
And that was the\none that I chose,
which was working digitally\nand not doing anything in post.
And then, as long as the--
and I kept going back\nwith different materials.
And there was a lifespan\nto start to most projects--
I don't think I'm\nalone in this-- where
you, eventually, you exhaust.
There are more unknowns.
And then, I switched.
I made a video works at the\nGlass House, which that was--
I made three video projects.
And then it's ended, but I have\nmade a few new pictures using
these equal density processes.
But it's over.
In a way, I think projects run\nthis of lifecycle of discovery,
understanding what it\nis, the rules as it were.
And then it concludes for me.
OK.
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.
[applause]
