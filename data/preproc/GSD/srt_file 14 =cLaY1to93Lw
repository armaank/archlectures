Good evening, and welcome.
Thank you all for coming.
Before we start, I think\nI want to mention--
I'll put in a quick plug\nfor this lecture on Monday,
by the Swiss architect\nPeter Markli.
He hasn't really\nbeen to the GSD,
as far as I can\nremember, ever before.
He will be here on Monday,\nand it would be great
if you could join us.
Then on Tuesday, we finally\nhave the opening of the Center
for Green Buildings and\nCities, which will also
host a public symposium\nhere in Piper,
at 4:00 PM, related to some\nof the work of the center--
but also working\non issues related
to typology, design, and\ntechnologies that relate
to the HouseZero project.
Tonight, after the brief\npresentation by Reinier de
Graaf, we've invited\nand I'm really
happy that Professors\nDiane Davis and Alex
Krieger will be joining\nReinier for a discussion.
The intention is to have\nthe presentation be shorter
than the normal lecture\nlength, so that we can actually
have more time for discussion.
Reinier is currently\nteaching an options studio
with the same title\nto the talk tonight,
which is Phantom Urbanism.
And the studio they've\njust returned from what
seems like a fantastic\ntrip to Angola,
and I suspect we'll\nhear more about that.
You probably all\nknow that Reinier
is one of the main partners\nat the Office for Metropolitan
Architecture--
OMA is based in Rotterdam.
And I think for\nthe longest time,
probably he's been the most\nimportant member of the office,
focusing on the urban\ndesign or the architecture
of the large-scale\ncomponent of the office.
Apart from some of the work\nthat Rein has been doing,
he really has been\ntaking on that work.
I was lucky enough to be able\nto spend a fair bit of time
with Reinier when there was\na project called Skolkovo
that Reinier and\nOMA were working on.
And I had some role there.
And, of course, Laura Byrd,\nwho is here visiting, and will
be part of the reviews\ntomorrow, was also,
at that time, involved.
So it's really a great little\nreunion of the Skolkovo team.
Since that time\nwhat is interesting
is to see how Reinier\nhas really gone
more and more towards the\ndesign of large-scale buildings.
And buildings that are\nreally, essentially,
significant major\nurban buildings.
He's completed a few of those.
The Timmerhuis, which\nis a mixed-use project
in Rotterdam, the\nheadquarters for G-Star RAW.
And this amazing project--
De Rotterdam-- which I\ngot to see in their office
while he was in Angola\nwhen I was there,
which is really pretty amazing.
Recently, Reinier has\npublished this very exciting,
very interesting book called\nFour Walls And a Roof, which
is published by Harvard\nUniversity Press.
It's subtitled The Complex\nNature Of a Simple Profession.
And in it there are\nreally an amazing number
of very beautiful, exciting,\ninteresting themes and topics.
And hopefully, Reinier\nwill be able to tell us
a little bit about the\nbook, but also more
about phantom urbanism.
Please join me in\nwelcoming Reinier de Graaf.
[applause]
Hi everybody.
Thank you for coming.
Thanks Mohsen, for\nthe kind introduction.
I have no idea what the\nnormal length of a lecture is.
I generally don't make\nit beyond 40 minutes,
and I don't think I\nwill do that today.
I think when we first discussed\nthe notion of a talk here,
it was meant to\nbe about the book.
And in part it is\nabout the book.
But the studio that's\ncurrently underway
is developing very well.
And in many ways already\nconsiderably more interesting
than the book.
So I cannot resist the\ntemptation of giving a little
bit of a trailer\nof the studio too.
Anyway, a little\nbit about the book.
The book, if I were\nto summarize it very,
very briefly, is\na 500-page attempt
to hammer away at what I see\nas the misplaced confidence
of the architecture profession.
It has 44 essays divided over\nseven parts, each of which
in a way debunks a\nmyth that I think
is looming over the\narchitecture profession.
There's the myth of\nauthority, the myth
of individual inspiration,\nthe myth of good causes,
the myth of professionalism,\nthe myth of independence,
mastery over the [inaudible],,\nand finally, progress.
These are, of course,\nin themselves all very
admirable and\nlaudable properties,
but it is very, very clear that\na slight change of context,
and a slight difference\nactually turns
these seven virtues potentially\ninto seven cardinal sins.
I think that in the\ncontext of the transition
of the 20th through\nthe 21st century,
certain profound\nchanges have happened
to the context within which\narchitecture is produced,
that, in a way, make\nit impossible to simply
uncritically\ncontinue that ethos.
And I will try to explain.
Essentially, after the\nfall of the Berlin Wall,
the 20th century ended.
The 20th century ended early,\nand the 21st century begun.
This is an argument\nvery eloquently made
by Francis Fukuyama,\nfirst in an essay,
After The Fall of the\nWall, which he later
expanded into a book--
omitting the question mark\nbehind End of History?--
where actually he argues that\nwith the fall of the wall
and with the collapse\nof the Soviet
Union, a world that used to be a\nworld of competing ideologies--
a Western bloc,\na communist bloc,
and a norm aligned block--
would pretty soon become\na homogeneous world,
which would collectively embrace\nWestern liberal democracy
as the sole and only\nform of human government.
So this was in the 90s.
And interestingly, that\nwas also the moment
that our office expanded\nvery, very strongly.
And I think many firms\nlike us, in a way.
The wave of optimism that\nfollowed the fall of the Berlin
Wall, led to the\nbelief of the fact
that you could work\nanywhere and counter
relatively similar conditions.
Sorry.
Encounter relatively\nsimilar conditions
to wherever you worked.
And at that moment, I think\nwe went from 30 to 300 people.
Of course, when you\nwork in the whole world,
the whole world ends\nup working at you.
So we have a very\ninteresting office--
350 people, just under\n50 nationalities.
It's very interesting\nthat in the Netherlands,
the Dutch are a minority--\nwhich is very good.
In the New York\noffice, the Americans--
or at least New Yorkers--
are a minority,\nwhich is even better.
In Hong Kong, the Chinese are\na minority, believe it or not.
And in Dubai, of course,\neverybody is a minority.
And it's not I'm not saying\nthat to do some sort of united
colors of architecture,\nbut I think
that the ecology\nof minorities is
a very interesting\nfactor, and maybe
the secret of our office--
that when there\nis only minorities
creation becomes a matter of\na permanent cultural clash,
in which there are very\nfew a prioris, in which
there isn't any given truth.
Like, we do things this way\nand you have to integrate.
There is just arguments.
There is just doubts.
There is just a fairly openly\nprofessing of not knowing.
This is a typical\nscene in the office.
I believe this is ages ago,\nwhen essentially our New York
partner was an intern.
The man you see here is\nthe founder of our office.
It's a collectively\nprofessed doubt,
in which the founder\nof the office
seems overcome by the\nmost extreme doubt.
[laughter]
And, anyway, that doubt\ncreates a lot of versions,
creates a lot of\nrejected versions,
creates a lot of\ntrial-and-error,
and occasionally it\ncreates a result.
And sometimes a very big result.\nThis is CCTV, completed in 2008
for the Chinese Olympics.
Came into the office in 2002.
And this is indicative of the\nworld the way it was then.
We had the choice to participate\nin the reconstruction
of the World Trade\nCenter, or take part
in a competition for the Chinese\nTelevision's headquarters.
And that was an almost\nneutral decision at the time.
That was essentially\na business decision.
We knew CCTV would get built\nbecause of the Olympics,
and we suspected the World\nTrade Center would become
a very long American talk show.
So essentially,\nwe chose for CCTV,
but purely on the basis\nof pragmatic arguments.
And that is interesting if\nyou think about that now,
because it's over 25 years\nago that the Berlin Wall fell,
and the world\nsupposedly opened up.
But meanwhile, other walls\nare being contemplated.
And essentially everywhere--\nbetween political blocs,
between religions, between\ncontinents, et cetera,
et cetera.
With a very predictable\nresult in many ways.
This is the total number--
it's essentially\nour project list.
This is everything that happens.
What is crossed out is\neverything that doesn't happen.
And curiously,\nprobably the projects
that get started and\nnever get finished
are more telling about the\nstate of the world at present,
than the projects\nthat do get finished.
And I want to talk a little\nbit about a number of efforts
that never got finished.
Another very interesting\naspect is the following,
of these walls appearing--
This is what\nFukuyama predicted--
an on-the-whole Western\nliberal democratic world.
I think crudely, the world\ntoday looks something like this,
if you have to rate it\naccording to democracy.
The blue is democracy.
The red is dictatorship.
There you don't have elections.
And the yellow is\na category which
is sort of democratic,\nbut not really.
You have elections, but you know\nbeforehand who's going to win.
And if that doesn't\nhappen, then certain things
are done to ensure\nthat he will win,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
But it's an increasingly\nsuccessful category--
a category in which a lot of\nurbanism, at the moment, takes
place.
It's a category that presents\na very interesting veil
to dictatorial regimes to become\ndemocratic, but not really.
But it also presents a\nvery tempting alternative
to countries that were\ndemocratic at one point,
to slide back into\nauthoritarian rule.
So my prediction is that the\namount of yellow in this map
will grow over time.
This is a project in a very\nstraightforward situation.
Here you don't have elections.
The glorious republic\nof Kazakhstan--
a former Soviet Republic,\nwith clearly the ills
of Sovietism, but\nalso, to some extent,
the good things of Sovietism.
A very interesting and ambitious\npublic housing program.
But after the discovery\nof oil in Kazakhstan,
Kazakhstan joined the\nranks of the world.
Joining the ranks of the\nworld looks like this.
It's a night club in Almaty,\nwhich is very appropriately
called Petroleum.
That leads also to particular\nviews on architecture
for some reason.
Money based on oil-well\nleads to a kind
of eruption of post-modernism,\nand [inaudible]
for some inexplicable reason.
But it's not just here.
We're finding this to be\nsomewhat of a pattern.
But maybe we can discuss.
Anyway, we wouldn't be we if we\ndidn't propose a project based
on former\nconstructivist diagrams,
assuming there would be\nan appetite for that.
So this was a science campus\nclose to the mountains--
close to the Chinese border--
for which a contractor\nhad been lined up.
The contractor that had built\nthe palace of the president,
a former Kosovar who turned out\nwas wanted by the Yugoslavia
tribunal for smuggling arm.
That was the way he\nmade his fortune,
and what led him to a\nsecond life in Kazakhstan
as a contractor.
That ultimately\ndidn't materialize.
We got another chance in\nthe form of a science city
in Russia itself, which had\na more solid and firm history
of science cities.
That's the plan for Skolkovo.
This is one that looked\nlike it was on the cards
to be won and built\nfor a very long time.
We presented it to the\nthen Russian president
Medvedev-- who, as we all know,\nis no longer the President.
So to some extent that\ndidn't happen either.
That's a very interesting\nthing, going back
to Fukuyama's argument.
The argument that is\npresented is ultimately
an economic argument.
Democracy is made dependent\non economic success.
The message, in short, is,\nif you become democratic,
you become prosperous,\nyou become wealthy.
It's your quickest\nticket to wealth.
But meanwhile, if we look\nat the global economy,
and the way it's developing, an\ninteresting thing is emerging.
These are the sovereign wealth\nfunds of various nations.
And if you make an\naddition, to some extent
you see that apparently\nnon-democracies
have the largest capital at\ntheir disposal to participate
in the global market.
You see this everywhere, with\nEmirate Airlines and all kinds
of things, where\nthey simply have
a head start because\nthe state participates
in economic entrepreneurship.
So this was Dubai in 1990.
Sheikh Zayed Road--\nthe main road.
This is a public housing\nprogram on the side.
This is that same\nroad 25 years later.
This is that same public\nhousing project here.
But clearly an eruption\nof a city in a very, very
short time, where\nnothing in this picture
is older than 15 years.
The city, in a way, celebrates\na perpetual tomorrow
on real estate fairs, on big\nsales events of ever more
extreme and extravagant towers.
In a way, the future of the\ncity, the city of tomorrow,
is the decorum for the\nlife and the city of today.
And interestingly,\nalso its aerial map
that you see on Google Earth,\nwhich is constantly presented
in the city as the\nDubai of today,
is actually the\nDubai of tomorrow.
So if you look at\nthis, this isn't there.
Or at least, it was\nthere, but I think
it's meanwhile under water.
This was planned,\nbut it isn't there.
This isn't there,\nand that isn't there.
Which means, that\nabout 50% of what
is presented in this\nphotograph as reality,
in all the promotion\nof the city,
actually doesn't exist yet\nand perhaps never will.
The city is like a collection\nof individual theme parks, which
happily, in a way, compete\nwith each other for attention,
to attract populations.
It's a city with\nabout 85% expats.
It's a city with a very\nsmall indigenous population.
And here, the function\nof urbanism is, in a way,
not to house people\nthat are there,
but it's to attract\npeople in order to come.
So there is a very\ninteresting reversal
in this kind of\nurbanism, where it
becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy,
with a lot of these massive\nplanning operations.
You ask the people in\ncharge, who is this for?
The answer is invariably,\nthey will come.
And they will come as long\nas they can buy a part.
But they don't come,\nthey buy real estate.
And they will continue\nto buy real estate when
they can sell that real\nestate, a few years later,
for more money then\nthey bought it.
But it's a very different role.
If you think of urbanism\nin the 50s and the 60s--
which, in a way, addressed\nthe housing shortage,
addressed a demographic\nneed-- this is simply urbanism
as a form of wishful thinking.
When you see this--
endless billboards along\nthe road with developments
announced-- you\nthink you are looking
at a landscape of\nfree enterprise.
That isn't true.
This is all the\nproperty developers
responsible for this stuff.
If you look at their\nannual accounts,
they invariably belong\nto three holdings,
which invariably are majority\nowned by the royal family.
So what you have\nhere is a landscape
of free enterprise\nurbanism, which is actually
a disguised monopoly.
A very interesting\ncontradiction.
The man who owns it.
The administrative\nstructure of the city
looks suspiciously like the\nadministrative structure
of any city--
of Amsterdam, or London.
But it's the populating\nof this diagram
that is the interesting thing.
This is the public sector,\nthis is the private sector.
And it is not because of\nlocal dress that people
look the same, it's\nsimply because they
are the same people.
[laughter]
Where in any Western democracy,\ntaking up public office
means you have to relinquish\nyour business interests,
here, business interests\nare a prerequisite
to take up public office\nin the first place--
to the point that you don't\nknow whether you are looking
at a city, at a state, or\nsimply a large corporation
that happily competes with other\ncorporations when it needs to.
This is the largest property\ndevelopers of Dubai,
and this is where they work.
They meanwhile\nstraddle a territory
which runs from\nAlgeria, all the way
to the Philippines\nand Indonesia.
It's a model.
Their rapid urbanism\nis actually being
exported all across the\nworld, operating along
very similar lines.
And export it as a\nform of knowledge.
Something which we've seen\nbefore in Singapore, which
essentially exports the\nnotion of the place as a form
of expertise to\nbuild stuff in China.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Now, this is a strange thing I\nfound on one of the real estate
markets in Dubai.
The extremely\nconfident predicament--
one day all cities will\nbe built like this.
And it's a curious\nquote, because it almost
echoes the confidence\nthat was at one time
embedded in the modern\nmovement of architecture.
I mean it's something\nthat [inaudible]
could have said in French.
Manifestos are written\nin architecture,
but if you put these\nmanifestos in a time line,
something very, very\nstrange presents itself.
Almost at the time that\nFukuyama wrote his book--
when the world would be one,\nno more need for ideologies,
that is also,\ncuriously, the time
that actually the production\nof meaningful manifestos
stopped in architecture.
That is at the same time--
round about, let's say, 1990--
that is at the same time\nthat large parts of the world
went through the most aggressive\nurbanization in history.
So largely, in a\ntheoretical vacuum
of the profession, which leads\nto a very strange situation,
if this is the city of\nthe future-- in 1925,
the Plan Voisin\nby Le Corbusier--
disparaged, dismissed\nover, it is still somehow
that model that seems to be\nthe only model available,
and the prevailing model.
According to which, essentially\nthese waves of urbanization--
there\'s a button called\n"danger" on this thing, which--
[laughter]
Sorry.
Which leads to a rather clumsy--
Anyway, in which these\nurbanization waves
continue to happen.
It's very interesting.
Urbanization, also in Asia,\nhas a very curious role.
The average\ncity-dweller represents
five times the economic\nvalue of a rural-dweller.
So if an enormous amount\nof people become urbanites,
the country gets\nfive times as rich.
At least, that's the\nreality on paper.
To the point that it leads to\nalmost all propaganda in China
being heavily infected\nwith real estate.
To the point that you don't\nknow whether the strong increase
in capita is the urban\npopulation growing,
or whether there is actually\na real economic growth.
To the point that cause\nand effect get confused.
I mean, do we urbanize\nbecause we get richer?
Or do we get richer\nbecause we urbanize?
And this strange\nconfusion emerges.
And in the wake\nof that confusion,
an interesting other\nphenomenon emerges.
This is the city\nof Ordos in China.
An enormously\nrapidly constructed
city, which is entirely empty.
Owned completely, but empty.
Something similar.
Another one--\nZhengdon New Area--
a completely empty city.
Tianducheng here--\nlonely man on a bike
looking at a replica of Paris.
Also sold, but completely\nempty and uninhabited.
Meixi Lake City, an empty lake\nsurrounded by empty buildings.
And for a long time, a lot has\nbeen written about this stuff.
And for a long\ntime we thought it
was a very Chinese\nphenomena-- simply
a phenomena of the\nplanned economy that
could afford to build and wait.
Meanwhile, that is\nno longer the case.
This is, by now, a\nglobal phenomenon.
Our studio has developed\na Top 100 of ghost cities
around the world.
And it is really a very,\nvery prolific phenomenon.
Particularly, after the\nfinancial crisis of 2008,
and the subsequent recovery,\nwhen the house-price index
went sharply up.
Incidentally, also\nafter the manifesto,
you get this kind of stuff.
This is in Spain.
Optimistic, advertisements of\nreal estate that meanwhile,
for a considerable length\nof time, stands empty.
Empty.
Another city--\nValdeluz in Spain.
Empty.
That's a very, very big quarter.
Roads and everything built.\nOnly partially built,
and whatever is built\nthere stands empty.
Empty roads,\ncompletely designed,
planted, but without buildings.
To the point that the\nname sign is the biggest
masterpiece in the city.
This is another\nexample in Morocco--
completely empty.
Another ghost town that\nhas been abandoned.
Something that has been built\nwithin the last five years,
and never inhabited.
The most striking example\nthat can be found online,
is the city of\nKilamba in Angola.
Conflicting reports on the\ninternet, whether it's empty
or whether it's not empty.
And so we decided to go\nand see for ourselves.
That city is a consequence of\na very confident announcement
of then-time president\ndos Santos in 2008,
when the price of\noil was sky high.
The city-- a\nChinese master plan.
And a city were\nlargely oil served
as collateral for a credit\nline to build the city,
but being built by\nChinese companies.
This is a man named Pierre\nFalcone, a French arms dealer,
who used to trade arms for oil.
And after peace broke out,\nhe traded concrete for oil.
Different product,\nsimilar action.
Here, somebody who was also\nvery enwrapped with the son
of Francois Mitterand, in what\nis termed to be Angolagate.
Anyway he brokered a\ndeal with the Chinese.
Welcome, here, the\nsite of the city.
Sino-Angolan\npartnership at work.
This is part of a promotion\nfilm for the city.
With the president's\npersonal involvement.
Chinese officials.
President dos Santos.
The President being personally\ninvolved, here, in a model.
A city for the young,\nas well as the old.
A city without barriers.
A city with all\nmodern convenience.
What is wrong with this image?
[laughter]
Anyway 2012, four years later,\nthe price of oil plummeted.
The Angolan middle\nclass, which was
expected on the basis\nof oil, never emerged.
This is the price that\napartments went for.
This is what 2/3 of\nAngolans live on--
less than $2 a day.
A big scandal Al Jazeera,\nthen the BBC, and then CNN,
all visited the\nsite and reported
on the exported\nChinese ghost towns.
They unmasked the people in\nthe promotional film as actors,
and showed empty footage of\nendless rows of empty, empty,
empty, buildings.
And essentially, a city for\nhalf a million people that stood
empty.
We decided to go and see\nfor ourselves, as I said.
Our studio is called\nPhantom Urbanism.
If that's like written\non your forehead,
nobody really wants\nto talk to you.
So for the duration\nof the field trip,
we had the Harvard website\nchanged in Rapid Urbanism,
and from very strongly\ncritical individuals,
we became temporary\nadmirers of the phenomenon,
but entirely for\nfact-finding purposes.
[laughter]
So the journey.
From the airport, this was\nthe first face you see--
Viva Fidel!
The typical, in a way, African\ncondition, on our long way
into the airport.
And once you reach\nthe center of Angola,
an entirely different\ncity presents itself.
Two very contrasting reality.
Interestingly, Angola is\none of the poorest countries
in the world.
But on the Mercer, Luanda\nis the most expensive city
in the world.
Very, very curious contrast.
But it's a contrast that\nby and large, in a way,
determines the\nface of the city--
the almost schizophrenic\nface of the city.
So we first went\ninto the poor half.
Sorry.
[laughter]
And then we continued our trip.
Our trip to the\nsupposed large ghost
town in the middle of Angola.
Here we were on the edge.
And there we visited, in\na way, the headquarters
of the group that was structured\naround the former arms
dealer, who had a project\nmanagement consultancy, who
had brokered the deal\nwith the Chinese.
And we were given\na royal welcome.
We were met by three employees.
[laughter]
Two men from Israel,\nand an Angolan guy
who was called Israel.
I mean, I--
[laughter]
I struggle to this\nday, what that means.
Very big meeting with the\nAngolan and Chinese flag
on the table, where we could\nask anything, where they had--
I have to say-- very\nplausible answer.
I mean, clearly,\nevery painful question
had been asked at least one\ntime before we showed up, so.
It was a big charm offensive.
They spent a full day with us.
They showed us the city,\nwhich meanwhile, indeed,
was inhabited.
They also educated us.
So this curious detail,\nwhen you zoom out,
is actually simply there to\nhold the air conditioner unit,
and the real balcony is there,\nand actually quite generous.
So that shows the bias\nnot just of the media,
but, I guess, also of us.
Anyway, the visit to\nthe mayor of the city.
His assistant, and\nthe group Israeli.
Goodbye.
And then we\ncontinued our journey
to the headquarters of CITIC,\nwhich is the Chinese investment
trust that is responsible\nfor nearly all
of the cities in Angola.
A hall with a giant\nmodel of the city,
also announcing further\nphases to the city.
That was the same\nmodel around which,
essentially, the Angolan-Chinese\npartnership was agreed.
I wonder whether who laughs\nand who doesn't is, in a way,
indicative of the\nstory to some point.
Also where essentially\nthe deal was signed.
Within the background the\narms trader, the French--
And essentially that\nmodel, as I said,
announcing further\nconstruction activity.
A very confident thing.
In the middle of it, a\nnew convention center
personally selected by\nthe previous President.
A sort of parametric\nsemiology in the context of
or rather mundane housing.
So that's what we saw.
And, in a way, what\nwas supposed to have
been an encounter\nwith a failure,
was actually a rather\nconvincing story.
But we had more days.
So this is day 2.
Another town, a little\nbit further away.
The town of Zango.
Actually, another\n[inaudible] builds.
These buildings are\ncompletely empty.
This is the people on $2 a day.
They were supposed\nto have become
middle class, live there.
This is empty.
Shantytowns are\nappearing at the foot.
And empty street\nbuildings, meanwhile,
disconnected from water,\nand standing there
like huge, empty carcasses.
This is still\nrelatively central,
and then there are\nsuburbs to the suburb.
This a location further away.
Decent looking stuff standing\nthere, but also completely
empty.
Almost like a beautiful\nDechirico painting,
but built for real.
There.
There.
And another one further away.
An endless city.
So again, completely\nempty, pristine buildings.
Very recently finished.
Empty interiors.
What do I do to\nmake the video run?
Ah.
OK.
[CRICKETS CHIRPING AND WIND\n BLOWING]
The wind and the crickets.
Anyway, the empty street.
And the same thing further\nout-- an empty street
to a suburban development.
Luxury housing.
Another luxury\nresort by the sea.
Also completely uninhabited,\nbut this one is sold.
Another development.
This time not in\nAfrica, but in Lebanon.
And I've used this\nexample to, in a way,
show that we can think\nabout this stuff as very far
away-- very far removed\nfrom our profession.
Stuff we wouldn't\nget our hands in.
But this is Herzog & de\nMeuron with the building
The Terraces in Beirut.
It's very interesting.
This is two buildings\nof the same size.
Both are of white concrete.
Both have 90 degree corners.
Both are modern.
The emptiness in this\nbuilding is a trauma.
It's a hotel that was\nfought over room by room,
never inhabited, and left\nlike a scar in the city.
This building is the same size.
It's also empty,\nbut the emptiness
is completely not a problem,\nbecause all the apartments have
been sold at record\nprices in Beirut
meanwhile booming\nreal estate market.
And I guess you could\nsay stylistically there
is a resonance.
Nevertheless, if you see,\none is a symptom of the 20th,
and the other one of the\nmodernism of the 21st century.
An acute difference\npresents itself.
A difference of a completely\ndifferent role of modernism
in the economic system.
That building is celebrated\nvery, very loudly
in the real estate press,\nbut at the same time
in the daily\nnewspapers of Beirut,
the building is vilified, and\nactually named and shamed.
And for me-- and that is the\ncore of where I wanted to get
to--
it illustrates a difference\nbetween the two centuries.
The century that started with,\nin a way, modern architecture
as a promise of liberation,\nonly to end up physically
triumphant-- build everywhere.
But this is something taken\noff a Greek real estate
website, that shows how many\ntax breaks you can get when you
leave the structure unfinished.
And it's almost a live version\nof the domino house, where
the physical triumph\nsomehow equals
the ideological bankruptcy.
And this is the point, I think,\nwhere the virtues become sins--
where the house\nthat at one point
was meant to be\navailable to all,
stands empty in a remote suburb.
And it's perhaps a reason to\nwrite a sequel to the book.
Thank you.
[applause]
Yes.
The instructions that we\nreceived from our dean
was to engage you in discussion\nabout urban design, at which
point you said you don't\nknow anything about it,
when we talked\nbriefly beforehand,
which I am sure is very\nmodest and untrue statement.
So I would like to\nask you, I'd like
to ask a question, which\nyou don't need to answer
immediately, but think about.
It's a naive question,\nbut it's in the mind
of virtually every urban\ndesign student in the building,
probably for the past 60 years\nsince the program was invented.
What's the difference between\narchitecture and urban design?
But don't answer that\nquestion, because I just
want to say something else\nabout what you just showed.
But don't answer it immediately.
There are different\nkinds of emptiness.
You talked about some of them.
I'd like to ask\nyou about what you
think about the emptiness\nof Detroit or Baltimore.
Equally empty, but for\nentirely different reason.
Right?
Also becoming a 21st\ncentury emptiness.
So say something\nabout the emptiness
that you discover\nin Detroit, and what
the relationship to either the\n20th or 21st century might be?
Well, I'm not per se interested\nin the emptiness of Detroit,
because it's a little off-topic.
I mean, there's plenty\nexamples of ghost towns
that were at one point\ninhabited and thriving,
and where people have gone\naway and now they're empty.
The thing that I tried to show--\nand that's the bizarre things--
is that all of these\nthings are new,
and they were abandoned before\nthey were even populated.
Which is a kind of weird\nform of [inaudible],,
I guess you could name it.
And I would cite Detroit, in\na way, possibly a little bit
the same way that I cited\nthe Holiday Inn in Beirut.
It's an emptiness which has\nat least absorbed history--
and the other emptiness\ndefies history.
And on the difference between\narchitecture and urbanism,
I don't know.
For me, it is very\nstrange to see
how much of these\nChinese cities,
if you look through\nthe hairs of your eyes,
how much they actually look\nlike modern paradigms developed
in the early 20th century,\nwhich are then constructed.
And maybe even constructed\nwith the best intention,
whether it's a global\neconomic system that
simply doesn't endure the same\ntype of utopianism anymore.
That still doesn't answer\nyour question, but--
Well, I'll ask it\nagain, but I don't
want to get you off the hook\ntoo easily about Detroit.
Because, yes, you might say it's\nan entirely different phenomena
in one way.
In another way, it is actually\nnot a different phenomena,
because both are a product of\nmisplaced affluence in a way.
Right?
The reason for\nDetroit emptiness has
all kinds of social and\npolitical implications,
but it's also the\ncapacity to start again
and to build anew, rather\nto invest in the existing.
And in that way, it's\nnot quite so different.
There's this phenomenon,\nwhich I think
is shared across the\npolitical-cultural context,
where we now have the\ncapacity for whatever reason,
to simply start over.
As opposed to, I suppose,\nin the good old days--
whenever they were--
several centuries ago, one\ndidn't have that capacity.
One had to improve\nwhat was there.
Yeah.
I think starting over is a\ncentral element of modernism.
And in that sense,\nyou are right,
because that's also what\nthey're doing in Angola.
I mean, they're starting over in\na place where there is nothing.
And then they start over, and\nthen there's still nothing.
I mean, it's quite interesting.
We spoke to a lot of\npeople, and the prime reason
for many people\nnot to move is not
even the cost of the\napartments, but the fact
that there is simply\nnothing there,
and that they would then still\nhave to come back to the place
where they are currently\nliving to do their job.
So the slightly more\nluxurious apartment
would give them\nthe inconvenience
of a lengthy commute.
And I think you can only start\nover if you fully start over.
And I think a lot\nof what you see--
and you see this, of\ncourse, also in Europe,
where we have the\nphenomena of new towns--
but as long as there are old\ntowns to steal the limelight,
the prevalence of the old\nmakes the starting over always
a half-hearted attempt.
And I think therefore\ncities where
there is absolutely nothing--
so if you don't start\nover, but you start--
then it has a certain\namount of chance.
But a lot of the other\nstuff remains stuck
in a kind of half-heartedness.
Yeah.
And do you want to--
I'm going to get back to the\ndifference between architecture
and design, and actually refer\nto a question to something
you said towards the\nend of your book, which
I wonder whether you said\nironically or positively.
But Diane-- Right?
Yeah.
Well, I'm going to let you\nget back to that conversation,
because I'm not sure that\nI'm the person to be involved
in that conversation.
But I wanted to make a few\ncomments about the really
stimulating presentation.
I work on the developing\nworld, so the kind
of story you're\ntelling is something
that I've seen and experienced.
I work mostly in Latin\nAmerica, not Africa,
but the question of the building\nof these big multi-complexes
for houses is all over\nLatin America as well.
And many of them are\nabandoned, but they're
partially occupied, and\npartially abandoned,
which creates a whole set of--
This was almost\naesthetically acceptable--
the fact that you have\nthese open, empty places.
But in Latin\nAmerica, and outside
of Latin American cities, you\nhave those housing complexes
which have drugs, and\nviolence, and people occupying
who don't own those\nplaces, because they've
been abandoned by the\nspeculators that lived in them.
But I guess I wanted\nto just say, share
a couple of comments, with\nmaybe a question, or just
more a clarification.
So I liked very\nmuch the situating
the phenomena in time-- not\njust architectural time--
but, of course, the\npolitical economy of time
after the fall of\nthe Berlin Wall,
and putting on the\ntable regime type,
and the kinds of\npolitics that are
behind the contracts for\narchitects around the world,
whether it's in China\nor Africa, et cetera.
I think that's really\nimportant, and something
that we have to think about,\nand be really critical.
Most of the big projects\nthat employ architects
are these types of projects\nthat you're mentioning there.
So it's something to think\nabout the profession.
But I also want to\nunderscore the fact
that that historical moment--\nthat break of the 90s--
is also a moment of\neconomic globalization.
So it's not just\nchanging the politics--
the democracy-- the\nchanging number of countries
that go from to democratic, and\nthen later to authoritarian.
It's also a moment of\neconomic globalization,
where real estate development\nand investment in property
is the general driving\nforce of the global economy
and many nations.
And in fact, in that sense,\nthe question about Detroit
is super interesting, because\nthese are related phenomena.
The fact that\nDetroit is abandoned
is because we've moved\nfrom industrial economies
to service and real\nestate economies--
even though I agree\nwith you Reinier
that the consequences of it,\nand what it means in the city
are very different,\nbut they're two ends
of the same global\ncapitalist system.
So I guess the question then\nbecomes, to me, for all of us,
is, is there any role at all\nfor architecture, urban design,
or even planning in\na problem that really
is a manifestation of how\nmoney moves around the world,
and uses space for exchange\nvalue not use value anymore?
So those places\nare not being built
from the perspective\nof what it would be
like to live in those places--
they're purely\nspeculative projects.
So that's one question.
And the second one we\ncan maybe talk about also
is, I am super\ninterested in the fact
that you guys were in Angola.
So the role of the Chinese\nin Africa is very different.
I mean, they're still the\nlarger political economy,
but it's more the exporting\nof the Chinese economy
into Africa.
So we could ask\nthe question, why
do Africans allow\nChinese to come in here
and build those things?
There's probably an\nexchange of goods.
There's probably\ncorruption, but there's also
natural resource exchange.
There's a large\neconomic transaction,
of which that's one small part.
But it's happening\nin Latin America.
Not built by the\nChinese, but built by US
mass producers,\ndomestic developers.
So we see the same phenomena\nin two very different
political places, which\nmakes me think that it really
is about how capital\nworks on a global scale.
So to repeat my question--
What can we do?
What is the role\nof our professions?
How much room for\nmaneuver is there if
that's really what's driving\nthe building project?
[inaudible]
I think clearly, if we remain\nunaware of the role of capital
and how capital plays,\nthen there is no role.
That's my theory.
If we build up an awareness\nof how things work,
there is perhaps\nhope for some role.
But I wouldn't go much\nfurther than that.
What changes in a building\nwhen you make it to be used,
or when you make it to be sold?
Does anything change?
Because the use is still\nan alibi for the selling,
but it's very interesting\nthat what is the underlying
motive becomes the\nulterior motive,
and becomes such a driver that--
Could the whole phenomenon--
And I think that you\nsee that in Dubai.
And I think Star architecture is\na very big part of that-- that
to some extent, the postures\nof extravagance in which
architecture is forced in\norder to draw the attention
to keep creating the\nsales value, is, I think,
a product of the\neconomic system.
I think post-modernism,\nand everything
that has happened\nsince, ultimately
owes its existence to\nan economic explanation,
and not to a stylistic\nchange within
the architectural profession.
I think the big change\nafter Fukuyama is not
even that the political system\ndictatorship is anything.
It's the fact that the\nglobal market opens up,
and cities are\nforced to compete.
And cities are forced to compete\nwith each other on a scale
that they never competed before.
Cities are built with\nthe hope to attract
a small group of people that\ncities all over the world
compete for.
So what applies to architecture,\na form of extravagance
applies to cities as well.
And that then leads\nback to the question,
I think-- it's also\nthe moment that
any traditional distinction\nbetween architecture
and urbanism becomes extremely\nproblematic, because they are
both parts of the same stake.
Whereas before you\ncould see urbanism
as the planning around a set\nof predictable parameters,
and you had limited\ntime to answer them.
And then architecture as\nthe expression of that.
Here, they really become part of\nthe same model in a joint pact.
I mean, the key\nword in anything--
If you saw that\nEck project show.
There's always one word.
And we use a lot of words as\narchitects to explain our work,
and the word is "wow".
That applies to cities,\nit applies to architecture
as well.
And I think in that\nlittle word, the triumph
of the exchange value\nover the use value
is incredibly manifest.
I mean, I thought--
stupidly, but I did think it--
that little air\nconditioning railing
was a balcony, and that one of\nthe effects of an architecture
which was simply built\nfor exchange value,
was that people didn't know\nhow to make balconies anymore,
because there were no\ninhabitants anyway,
so why get on a balcony?
Something just had\nto look as a balcony.
Which I thought was a super nice\nstory, until, of course, you
go there and you find out it's\nan air conditioning holder.
But that doesn't take from the\nfact that things like that--
take this one step further--
things like that could happen.
That at a certain point\ningredients of buildings
are made to look a certain way\nto suggest a certain thing,
and that there's already the\nknowledge that they may never
be used that way.
Of course, it's a\nrelatively young phenomenon,
and I don't think we\nhave actually seen
the end of that development.
The thing here?
I'm sorry.
You said something\nabout the distinction
between architecture\nand urbanism.
Right?
And I'm not going to talk\nabout architecture too much,
but I do want to say that\nI think it's important--
what your presentation and\nsome of the work that I'm
doing on these types\nof places in Mexico,
suggests to me that\nit's very important
to distinguish between--
it's not just the\nexchange versus use value,
the unit of analysis\nthat you're building for.
So is the thing is the physical\nbuilding, is it the house,
or is it the person?
So where do people\ncome into this picture?
Because this is, of course,\na stereotype of what I like
to think that what we do in\nan urban planning program--
urban planning and design--
but in other words, you're\nbuilding for human life.
Right?
And sometimes, you\nwant to make sure
that in the architecture,\nthat sense of the entire array
of activities that create the\nquotidian urban experience,
that's what I call urbanism.
And I see think of that as\ndifferent than architecture.
Which isn't to say\nthat architecture
doesn't contribute to urbanism,\nbut these are projects where--
And it's not even that you\ncan blame the architect.
It was probably a machine,\nor some mass produced model--
but there is no thought at all\nabout the urban experience.
Even the location of\nthem as you said people
don't go out there\nbecause it has
nothing to do with what\nmakes life meaningful.
There's no transport.
There's no shops.
Maybe they have public space--
which is this big empty\nlot in between the towers--
but there is really no attempt\nto think about urbanism
as creating the conditions of\nsocial interaction and meaning.
And I think that's what we\nwould like to be able to do,
by introducing the kind\nof discourses of planning,
urban design, and architecture\ntogether in the same set of--
working together to\ncreate those spaces.
And the models that we're\nseeing around the world,
do not have that mindset.
They're just about the building\nand its exchange value.
Yeah, although the one\nexample that we did
find to be inhabited--
I mean, the one ghost city\nthat wasn't a ghost city--
it did have shops, it\ndid have public space,
it did have interaction.
It seemed a relatively\nhappy place.
And it was not that dissimilar\nfrom the other ones.
It was just inhabited.
I was born in an area which\nwas also mass produced,
prefabricated, and\nprobably with none
of the noble\nconsiderations you're
listing ever on the\nmind of the designers.
Nevertheless, I\nremember that as a place
with a lot of social\ninteraction, and a warm place
as well, even though it was an\nindustrially produced thing.
So I think that is a\nvery complex thing.
I just think it's\na matter of timing.
It's interesting, you say,\nwhat makes this happen?
Why did the Chinese\ndo that in Angola?
Because Angola wants\nto reconstruct.
It wants to get a loan off\nthe IMF, or the World Bank.
And they say, no, because\nyou are a corrupt country.
We won't get our money back.
What happens then?
Then there is a power\nin the East, who
has to do virtually nothing.
It just has to wait\nuntil all the discarded,
rejected countries by the\ninternational financial
institutions just\nline up, come to them.
They essentially trade\noil for concrete.
They even avoid a\nmonetary component to it.
They completely loot\nthe financial system.
They don't play by the rules.
And that's also a\nvery different world
from the world of Fukuyama.
Yes, it's a global\neconomy, but it's
with three or four\ndifferent sets of rule.
And nobody's strong enough\nto enforce one of these sets
as the law for all.
So I think what we are\nvery much witnessing is not
the end of globalization, but\na breakup of globalization
in compartments.
And the jury is out\nwhich will be victorious.
Because also in Angola you get\na lot of people from the West.
And they produce big books--
brochures.
They analyze patterns of slums\nas interestingly humane things,
but they do nothing.
Essentially, the Chinese build.
That stands empty.
So it's a very curious\nmix between, let's say,
Western highbrow impotence,\nand Chinese can-do.
And either of them seem\nextraneous to the place.
[laughter]
And that there's that\ngap-- but I'm serious--
it's that gap that\nI find extremely
interesting to explore, and\nthat I also don't explicitly
have an answer to.
I mean-- sorry, you want to\ntalk about Detroit again?
[laughter]
I actually think that Detroit\nis equally fascinating,
but I'll move on.
But I don't really\nwant to talk about it.
But I do appreciate that that\nis all you want to talk about.
I actually want to\nget back distinctions
between architecture and urban\ndesign, which is actually
an extension of what\nDiane was starting to say.
Again, in an earlier\nconversation,
you said something\nabout, OK, so when
you go to Angola right now,\nwhat does the architect do?
The answer is not an\nadditional building.
There's no need for an\nadditional building.
Not in the context\nof this stuff.
That's right.
OK.
So here's a distinction\nfor me between architecture
and design.
I think that urban\ndesign may be less
complicit in this phenomenon\nthat you were just describing,
because buildings are\nnot our only technique.
If you, as an\narchitect, well, you
either build that building\nwhether its necessary or not,
or I don't know what you'll do.
But the possibility of an\nurban design discipline--
and obviously to the extent that\nthere is an earlier planning
and even landscape architecture,\nwhich we haven't discussed
at all--
is that there are other\ntechniques available which
may be a form of resistance\nto this phenomenon
that you're so sure is\nhappening around the globe,
but doesn't really,\nagain, encompass
the entirety of urbanization\naround the globe.
So is that an actual\ndistinction, in your mind,
between the role of the\narchitect versus the role--
let's call it an\nurbanist-- whether they
can call an urban designer\na planner, or actually
kind of a\nsociologist-oriented urbanist,
or a landscape architect, who\nactually thinks a heck of a lot
more about things\nthan buildings.
So is the architectural\nprofessional limited in a way--
limiting itself in this era--
because their only\ntechnique is to build.
Whereas the needs-- whether it's\nin Angola, or for that matter,
in Detroit--
is to produce something other\nthan additional buildings.
Perhaps, but, I don't\nknow, the distinction
simply doesn't exist to\nthe same degree in my mind.
I'm sorry.
It's something that I\nnever really think about.
Because I do projects on\neither side of the spectrum.
Small buildings, and\nlarge buildings, and even
projects where we take away\nbuildings as an urbanist.
And I regard all of\nthat architecture,
and you could call\nall of it urbanism.
But the point of the subject--
and particularly, the\npoint of the subject
in an academic context, but also\nin our profession at large--
is, of course, precisely that.
It's to derail the\ntraditional reflex
that the solution to any\nproblem is a building.
Because that is\nwhat architects--
Any client comes in.
He may have all\nsorts of problems,
but an architect will always\ntell you, you need a building.
Why do they say that?
Well, it's obvious\nwhy they say that.
And what I find fascinating\nabout this thing
is that the evidence that you\nshouldn't add another building
is so abundant, and\nso in your face,
that even the staunchest,\nstubborn, blinkers-on architect
will not remain immune\nto the devastation that
actually building can cause.
So I think, in a way, by\nshowing so many buildings and so
much architecture, I might have\nunwittingly made your point.
So, thank you.
[laughter]
You're welcome.
So what might that have\nto do with, say, the way
that the next generation\nof architects--
or planners, for that\nmatter, or urbanists,
if they might call\nthemselves such--
how should they be trained?
Should there be some\nadjustment in the way
in which we grow up\nto be architects, or--
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I think one of the key things--
The solution to\nany problem begins
with a frank acknowledgment\nthat there is a problem.
And I think that's almost\nthe stage we are in.
I think a lot of\narchitectural education
would benefit\nimmensely, if it simply
understood more of the\ncontext in which it operates,
so that it can at least\nprevent becoming complicit
in a number of\nthings, that where
it thinks it's doing good,\nit's actually doing wrong.
But beyond that, I\nguess it's quite OK
for the training of an architect\nis to momentarily pause
the reflex to learn how to\ndesign buildings, and simply
study this stuff for a\nwhile, and come what may.
We should probably try to\nengage the audience, too,
if there are questions.
Which I'm sure there are.
But I didn't want to--
Well, I'll just\nsay one more thing
about the question about how we\nshould be training our students
and ourselves to deal\nwith these problems.
And I just-- this is going\nto be so obvious, but--
I just want to make\na plea for thinking
about the multiplicity\nof activities that
occur in the site, and\nat different sites,
that create what I call\n"everyday urbanism",
is so much more than\njust the building,
and the techniques\nof the building.
And one of the things, also--\na problem that I'm seeing--
it's the complicity of the\ngovernment and the developers--
whether it's in Angola\nor in Latin America,
or whatever-- is this idea\nof the focus on housing.
The house.
That somehow if\nyou have a house,
you're creating the\nfoundation for urbanism.
And I take seriously\nyour comment
that people can make\na place lively even
if it's mass produced.
So human interaction\ncan overcome
the the trauma of a terrible\nmass-produced design.
But I do think that we want to\nbe designing for those places
from the get-go.
Not making sure that\npeople just have
to remake them to correct the\nerrors of the designs that
are focused on the\nbuilding, and don't think
about the liveliness of\nthe urban experience.
So I think that we have classes\nthat focus on that here,
but we could do more\nto teach our students
about the multiplicity\nof environments that
create the experiences\nof urbanism seen
from the perspective\nof human beings
that are going to\nbe in the buildings
that we're designing for them.
But, I know.
Other people want to--
You may not need the\nanswer the question.
Yes.
So Michael, there was a young\nman who raised his hand first,
and perhaps you can follow.
Hi, Reinier.
Hi.
You mentioned the\ncities nowadays
are competing with each\nother to attract people,
but I was looking at\nthe news about Kilamba,
and I saw a lot of titles.
It's like, The 10 Coolest\nGhost Towns In the World.
The Five Ghost Hot Spot.
20 Things You Have To Know\nBefore You Go to Angola.
So the phenomenon\nof problem become
a phenomenon of amusement.
Yeah.
And the empty cities' inability\nto attract people to live there
become the reason to attract\ninternational visitors.
So how do you think\nof that paradox?
Inasmuch as extravagance\nis an essential ingredient
of competition, of\ncourse, extravagance
can work in any direction.
What you see very much is that\nin the competing for attention
in modern media and\nin general, it's
that almost any extreme becomes\nnewsworthy, whether its good
or bad.
You get a situation of\na kind of Nietzschian
beyond good and evil\nin the face of extreme,
in that the extremity\ndefies the value judgment.
And that's also where\nthe interesting relation
to human use comes in.
Because it's a very\nweird situation where
you have criminals\nin talk shows,
because that attracts people.
You have the most\nweird phenomena.
Just as long as they're\nunusual they're extreme,
they have some sort\nof marketing value.
And indeed Kilamba was\none of those things, too.
At least, in the media it's\nbeen portrayed as such.
Almost to the point that\nwhen you find it inhabited--
and that's good--
it becomes a disappointment.
And it's a very perverse twist.
There's actually an odd\nrelationship back to Detroit,
where there's a kind of a--
[laughter]
-- There's actually\na term-- ruin porn.
Right?
Yeah.
Ruin porn, yeah.
Ruin porn.
And there's dozens of\npublications, and, in fact,
a tourism little system by which\nyou visit Detroit or Baltimore,
to see the decline of American\ncivilization, or whatever.
But Michael.
Right?
Yeah.
Well, I want to come\nback, just for a moment,
to the balcony that\nlooks like a balcony,
and meant not to be occupied.
And you thought\nyou were mistaken,
but I wonder if the Herzog & de\nMeuron Terraces aren't exactly
that in this sense.
Our students have\na-- it's almost
like a new, what Beaux-Arts\ncalled the [inaudible],,
which our students call\nthe trebiated stack.
And what that means--\nand the Dutch started it,
but I wish you would\nhave said, perfected it--
Because this\nelegantly thin slab,
with a highly variable edge\nthat changes as you go up,
which solves their problem\nthat they don't always
know how to wrap--
It solves the problem of\nfiguring out the facade,
because doesn't really have one.
It looks great in a study\nmodel, and it actually
looks great unoccupied.
And I'm thinking of\nthe Miami parking lot.
It is a fabulous\nempty building, that
occupying it distracts from it.
So I wonder if capital has found\na new kind of typology that
exactly satisfies the\nunoccupied building.
Yeah.
Because you don't need lights.
You don't need curtains.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah and the inhabitant\nbecomes an intruder.
I think that was a highbrow\nmoment of impotence.
Yeah--
[laughter]
So Reinier, I just want\nto ask you about Detroit.
[laughter]
No.
Just joking.
So it seems, of\ncourse, that much
of what you're talking about has\nto do with the rise to hegemony
of finance capitalism--\na particular modality
of capitalism.
And so and then housing within\nfinance capitalism becoming
more and more primarily--
or leaning towards\nit-- operating
as a financial instrument.
So we could call it--
as I think you have\nin various ways--
a post-bodily\nversion of housing,
or a post-shelter\nversion of housing.
And then maybe we could say it's\na post-human form of housing.
And I'm kind of curious in\nthis thinking of post-humanism
is in relation to\nthis phantomness--
and if we think of it as an\navatar of post-humanism--
how you might speculate\nor make connections
to other avatars\nof post-humanism?
The data center--
Yeah.
Although that is\na different thing.
Because the role of a data\ncenter isn't necessarily
a speculative\nobject for finance.
It really is a\nhouse for machines.
And of course there's\na long tradition
in architecture of building\nbuildings for machines,
sometimes very,\nvery beautifully.
But the comparison\nthat springs to mind--
At one point, a stash\nof gold at Fort Knox
was the counterbalance\nof the financial system.
Those days are over.
But currently, it is the\ncollective real estate property
value that acts as a balance\nto the financial system.
But it's about as functional\nas a pile of gold.
So it's like a piggy bank.
What was gold was concrete.
In that sense, it's becoming\nmanifest to the point
that human use almost becomes\nincidental to the object.
I think that's-- yeah.
That's precisely.
I'm not sure that's a creation\nentirely of the last 20 years.
I think that there are--
not as extensive, but\nthere are examples
of this across history.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I mean the [inaudible]\nof architecture
has functioned as a financial\nspace since the beginning
of architecture.
But I think Reinier has a point\nin its increased emphasis,
let's say.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the scale of\nit has certainly
become much more prevalent.
There must be--
Right there.
Yes.
All right.
Reinier, when you\nput up your graphics
showing which countries are\ndemocracies and markets and all
that.
I wonder how old\nthat graphic is--
That's outdated by-and-large.
OK.
But it's indicative of the fact\nthat there are three systems.
Well, not even systems.
It's indicative of the\nstatus of elections.
OK.
Either you leave\nthem to chance--
which is what a\nWestern democracy is,
and you end up with weird\npresidents sometimes--
or you don't have them, or\ncountries where you have them,
and you know the\noutcome in advance.
That is simply all\nthat thing says.
And that changes.
We would have called turkey\na democracy 20 years ago.
Not anymore.
Hungary, Poland, respectable\nmembers of the European Union,
are sliding in a\nsimilar direction.
It's certainly not a static map.
In as much as it is\nwrong, I apologize.
But the point of the map\nis the three-way system
and that yellow is\non the increase,
which I would stand by.
Did you have a question about--
Yeah?
Well, I noticed that Nigeria is\nmarked as a pseudo-democracy,
and I do know that for the first\ntime since their independence
in 1960, they had a\ntransition in power where
the incumbent actually\nlost an election, which
was a huge deal to them.
And so, when I saw\nthat, I think that they
would say that they're\nsolidly a democracy now.
And the democracy, while it's\npretty young, that it's growing
from strength to strength.
So I just wanted\nto point that out.
That's very helpful.
We'll change that in\nthe next iteration.
There's probably a level--
There's probably shades\nof yellow, obviously.
If you really wanted to get--
They have shades of blue, too.
And shades of red, too.
Yes exactly.
That's right.
Yeah.
But if you make too much nuance,\nyou can't hold a lecture.
[laughter]
Whoever has the mic can speak.
I just wanted to pick\nup on the idea that
are these things really\ndifferences in kind?
Or are they differences\nin scale, or in degree?
Because, for example,\nstreet car suburbs in the US
sometimes took 30 to 50\nyears to actually fill in.
And on the converse, some of the\nstories in major news outlets
about the Chinese\n"ghost cities" have
had to be retracted or\nupdated because some of them
have turned out to be untrue.
So I wonder, are these real\nestate speculations as flimsy
as they appear?
Or in 50 years will we see\nthat, although some of them
are failures, maybe\nthe phenomenon
is more rational and\npredictable than it appears?
Well we came across this\nclearly when we started
to study the phenomenon.
And we set certain parameters\nto define yes or no.
But anything built\nin the last 10 years,
of which more than 50% stood\nempty for more than a year,
qualifies one way or\nanother to be on this list.
Particularly because the\npressure on real estate
to be inhabited or sold from\nthe get-go is only increasing.
I mean things are\nsold off the drawing.
Things are sold off sketches.
So in terms of sales\npressure, is enormous.
Which means that when a building\nstands empty even for a month
after completion, the economic\nloss that it represents
is enormous.
And it would be very\ninteresting to make
a calculation of the\nvolume of emptiness
that we will find globally.
Take the amount of\nmoney missed out on--
because they are all calculated\nto hit the ground running,
to make money from day one.
So the economic loss,\nor the economic burden
of this thing, to\nassess that per country
or perhaps globally, would be\na very interesting thing to do.
Because yes, they get populated,\nbut when they get populated
even a day, or a week too late,\nthe economic costs of that
are enormous.
May I-- I don't know hardly\nanything about Angola, but I--
I know nothing\nabout Detroit, so--
[laughter]
And I won't ask any more\nquestions about Detroit.
But to respond to a\npoint that you made.
If you were to visit\nWashington DC, in around 1825,
you would see gigantic wide\nstreets with trees along them,
and not a building in sight,\nexcept for a capitol building.
Actually under fire at some\npoint the 20s, because--
And so the notion\nthat some things get
finished after a\nwhile, again, it's
not simply a product of the\nfall of the Berlin Wall.
Too many things seem to be the\nproduct of the Berlin Wall,
and I'm not sure I subscribe\nto quite that condition.
But secondly, in\nChina, the race will
be between how soon these things\nwill be occupied, versus how
quickly they will degrade.
Because the construction of\nthese things is fairly shoddy,
and the longer they\nstay uninhabited,
the quicker they will\nbegin to decline.
It's clear to me most\nof them will be filled,
because the demand is great,\nand the rise of the middle class
continues, at least\nfor a while, in China.
But the problem\nwill be if some stay
too long, they'll\nbecome uninhabitable,
as opposed to simply empty.
Right.
Yes?
So we were briefly\ntalking earlier about
there's ingredients\nin urban condition
that we should be thinking\nabout more broadly.
I find the project to\nbe a unique opportunity
to start to qualify\nthe importance
of these ingredients, because\nyou have an instance where
one of these ghost\nor phantom cities,
ended up being inhabited-- the\none that you went there for.
Does it have anything\nthat another one does not?
Is it a distance from a place?
When do people start\nto find the balance
and invest in\ninhabiting the place?
When does it become more optimal\nto live, and do the commute?
Well, it was very important that\nthat thing became a success.
So I think after the\nChinese made their money,
I think there were a number of\nmeasurements taken on behalf
of the Angolan government,\nwhich was, in a way,
reduce house prices\nvery, very strongly,
set up a mortgage system\nwhere I think you can pay off
your mortgage in 100\nyears, which means you get
a manageable monthly payment.
So they made the\nadjustment to make
the thing affordable for them.
And they did that because that\nwas a highly-publicized project
and needed to be a success.
Whether they can do that\nfor every single one
of these developments without\nbankrupting their country,
remains to be seen.
This is also a product\nlargely of an accident.
In China, there\nis a middle class
based on a gradual steady\ngrowth of the economy.
This is an economy\ndependent on oil 100%.
They've sold even their\nfishing rights to the Russians.
They're dependent\non selling oil.
The refined oil\nis being important
in Angola, because they\nhaven't even got the industry
to refine their own oil.
So it's purely what's in\nthe land that is being--
Which means that the moment\nthe price of oil drops,
they are so deeply screwed that\na perspective middle class--
a prospective demographic, which\nwould inhabit these things--
simply doesn't exist.
The currency is one-on-one\ncorrelated to the price of oil.
So it secures real estate.
And that's, of\ncourse, interesting.
Because when real estate\nbecomes a prediction,
which is my argument that\nafter the Berlin Wall,
it has once again maybe become.
If real estate is a\nprediction, and then
planning is very,\nvery difficult.
And also the notion of a\ntraditional urbanism, which
is a very strong\nplanning ethos, because--
It becomes a prediction.
And the essence of a prediction\nis that it can be wrong,
and that 50% of the\ntime it is wrong.
And then urbanism\nhappens on a vast scale.
So it's a gamble\nwith a huge risk.
Because when the\ngamble goes wrong,
you get a frightening numbers\nof these empty things.
Yeah.
Yes.
Please.
So, to me, seeing that\nimage of those slums
next to these apartment\nbuildings, that just hurts.
I see that.
I'm like, wow.
And to me, I'm very practical.
Of course, you want to come up\nwith some sort of a solution
to provide a long-term\nstructural solution that this
doesn't happen anymore,\nhopefully-- that we are going
to build more for the people\ninstead of for investments.
So that requires a lot of\nthinking in a very deep level.
On the other hand,\nI was just wondering
to what extent did the\nstudents in the studio
project or the office\nthink about solutions--
practical solutions--\nbut also not only
from a top-down\nperspective, but perhaps
from more of a bottom-up\ncommunity perspective?
Do you think about that?
What are the leads\nthat you think
might be the way to\ngo, to solve this?
You sound Dutch.
Is that correct?
That's very correct.
Well, that's not up to me.
We are half-way in the studio,\nand another half is coming.
So I think there'll be\nleads from many directions,
but it's early to say.
This is, in a way, what\nI've presented to the--
an enhanced studio brief.
And the report of a field\ntrip, which, in a way,
makes that studio brief acquire\neven more scary dimensions.
And the whole point\nis that this thing
is meant to unsettle\nthe traditional reflex
of an architect,\nwhich I think it does.
And that's also essentially\nthe whole point of the talk.
And leads will follow with time.
By the way, it's\nalso, as you said,
one of the points of your\nbook-- which I highly recommend,
by the way.
I will do a little bit of\nshilling on your behalf,
and even ask a\nquestion about it.
Because I think that\nyou uncover not simply
with too much building, but\nyou uncover other dilemmas
that are a consequence of\neither too much or too little
power in the hands\nof the architect.
Maybe there will be time\nfor a couple more questions,
but let me ask you,\none of the things
that fascinates\nyoung people today
is a potential\nutopia, which is often
described as the smart city.
Or rather, forgetting\nthe term smart, now,
the notion that through\nresearch and through data,
and through our ability to\ncollect enormous amounts
of data, a certain set of new--
not intuitive, but\nmore objective--
ways to understand the\nworld might emerge.
You wrote a very skeptical\nessay about smart cities.
It was one of my favorite\nessays in the whole book.
But say something about this.
Right?
I know I'm throwing you\noff guard each time,
but the the role\nof the moderator.
It's fine.
It's fine.
I'm thinking which essay.
You attended a conference--
Oh, yeah.
I object to the term\nsmart city, particularly
by people who haven't\nbeen occupying themselves
with the city for very long.
Because whenever they\nuse the term smart city,
they imply that\neverybody else is dumb.
That we've been dealing\nwith the dumb cities.
That is objectionable.
But I think there's a number\nof things to be said here.
It's an initiative on behalf\nof private companies-- mainly
tech giants.
The ulterior motive\nthere is invariably
to sell more of\ntheir technology--
to sell more of their stuff,\nto sell more of their sensors.
And they pose as urbanists.
And we've dealt with\nquite a few of them.
And once you\nscratch the surface,
and you're behind\nthe front door,
you find out that\nthere is nothing there.
Yet there is rhetoric--
almost biblical,\nevangelical rhetoric--
about the level\nof redemption they
can offer to\nprevailing crises, that
almost echoes the same\nhubris as the modernists
had in the 1930s.
And just as they\nfound their Waterloo,
I'm sure the smart city people\nwill find their Waterloo.
I think it's very important to\nacknowledge that the technology
is agnostic.
The internet brings\nmore freedom,
but in a different\npolitical context,
the internet brings\nmore surveillance.
And so the whole thing\nis doubly etched.
And I think to talk\nabout the smart city
outside a political framework\nis almost meaningless.
Because it is, in the end,\nthe political framework
that will decide if those\nthings are useful or not.
And it's typically very much\nan extremely technocratic
discussion at the moment, with\ngenerally too much optimism.
Absolutely.
As have been prior\nutopias, of course.
I just want to say quickly,\nbefore the next question,
that that description of what\nyou think about the smart
technology-- these are\ntechnology firms masquerading
as urbanist--
you could have said it\nexactly about the presentation
you gave tonight.
That those builders-- you can\ndo the exact same critique.
Slightly different.
They're not doing it\njust with technology.
But these are speculators\nmass-produced builders that
are masquerading as urbanists.
Well, they bypass architects\njust as much as the smart city
bypasses architects.
I mean, that's just very true.
I thought you were talking\nabout me for a moment.
[laughter]
Speaking of the\npolitical context,
it seems to me that the\nrole of private property
structures the\nentire conversation.
And it might even be the\nanswer to the division between
an architect and\nan urban designer,
because an architect designs\na place that's privately
for someone, and an urban\ndesigner is at least supposed
to-- in principle--
design a space that's\nfor a lot of people.
And everything you showed\nwas just obviously--
since it's for an\nindividual's profit--
the only thing that is keeping\nthe people from moving in there
is that there's a fence, and\nthat they don't legally own it.
So I'm wondering\nif, as you said,
some of our fellow\narchitecture students
here need to study that\nsort of political context,
and what your guys' thoughts are\non the role of private property
in the various problems\nyou're talking about.
Yeah.
I don't think we have--
[laughter]
I've got all night.
We want to go for a drink.
[laughter]
I live here.
[laughter]
Congratulations.
Private property is a\nvery ambiguous thing.
And that's why I ask\nhow long do we have.
I somehow have an\nethical problem
with the idea of owning\nthings that you don't use.
And I sometimes wonder\nwhether a lot of the conflict,
injustice, unfairness,\net cetera, in the world,
is simply because\nthat is the one
ethic that the very\nmany religious books
that different parts\nof the world abide by,
chose to neglect.
So that's my view\non private property.
Maybe one or two\nquestions before we--
I actually have one.
Oh.
We're talking about this new\ncapitalist, empty housing
typology, and I was wondering\nwhat your thoughts are
on the examples of the contrary,\nwhere, for example, in Caracas,
the Torre de David,\nwhich was left half built
was actually filled in.
And this also happened in\na hospital in Buenos Aires.
And how this is like\na contrasting thing,
and is that--
One of the things I--
and don't know whether it's the\nefficiency of security firms
that parade around these things.
I mean, they were certainly very\nefficient when we were there.
But I don't know\nwhether it's there--
I'm from Amsterdam, and there\nwe have a massive squatting
movement in the 1970s, when\nthere was a vast speculation
with real estate.
People just building going\nto rot, they collected rent,
and rent, and rent.
And it was a big squatting\nmovement, and I simply wonder,
why-- in a context like this--
that doesn't happen.
Because you could\neven live in them
without the thing\nbeing connected
to electricity and water.
They're still some\nway inhabitable.
And that is maybe even\nan interesting model.
A kind of mass organized\nsquatters' movement,
that would simply cut off\nthat type of development
by the path.
Maybe a final question?
If not, I think we should go on\nwith our evenings, or drinks,
or work.
One place that's never\nempty, by the way,
is Gunn Hall, as\nyou might realize.
So I think we should--
Thank you very much\nfor participating.
[applause]
