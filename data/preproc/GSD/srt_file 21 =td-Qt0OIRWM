OK.
Good evening,\neveryone, and welcome
to tonight's special\nDan Kiley lecture.
Thank you for our\nguests that are
coming from Boston and other\ncities around the Boston area.
For those of you\nthat don't know me,
I'm Anita Berrizbeitia, Chair\nof the Department of Landscape
Architecture, and I am very\npleased to introduce tonight
GSD alum, design\ncritic, and Most
Distinguished Landscape\nArchitect, Toru Mitani.
Toru is a founding partner, with\nHiroki Hasegawa, Chisa Toda,
and Yuuki Suzuki, of 'studio\non site,' and a professor
of Landscape Architecture\nat Chiba University's School
of Horticulture in Tokyo.
Throughout two and a\nhalf decades in practice,
he has built a\nremarkable portfolio
of projects, many of\nthem in collaboration
with distinguished Japanese\narchitects such as Fumihiko
Machi, Shigeru Ban, and Say\nTakeyama, to name a few.
Toru's intellectual formation\nis unique in both American
and Japanese\ndisciplinary contexts.
He received a Master\nof Architecture
from the University of Tokyo,\nand a Master of Landscape
Architecture here\nat the GSD in 1987,
continuing on to receive his\nPhD from the University of Tokyo
in 1992.
As a scholar his\nresearch has focused
on Asian gardens, specifically\nthe gardens of Korea,
modern China, and Japanese\ngardens and urban landscapes,
both historical\nand contemporary.
Not so well-known is the\nimpact that American landscape
architecture has\nhad in his career.
The two primary influences for\nToru while he was at Harvard
were minimalism's focus\non landscape expression
as both material\nand visual logic,
and related to this,\nphenomenology's position
that one makes\nsense of the world
through visual perception.
A third key influence on\nToru has been none other
than the American\nlandscape itself,
specifically precision\nagriculture, those forms
of production in which\nmanagement and cultivation take
on a serial expression\nat immense scales
as seen in the American\nmid- and southwest.
Finally, American\nearthworks, land art,
and extraction landscapes\nwere the topics
of his 1992 dissertation.
While he was a student at the\nGSD, we saw, with great envy,
how he drove across the\ncountry twice, first following
a southern route,\nBoston-LA, returning
via the northern route, San\nFrancisco back to Boston.
In this, his own version\nof the Grand Tour,
he documented the sights\nthat would eventually
be the subject of\nhis dissertation,
and of a series of essays\nhe published in Japanese
upon his return to\nJapan a few years later.
His essay, Pilgrimage Through\nthe American Landscape,
his translation\ninto the Japanese
of John Beardsley's\nEarthworks and Beyond,
and a series of articles\non landscape architects
Peter Walker, George\nHargreaves, and others,
were the result of\nhis fruitful journey
through the United States.
Perhaps, as a result of this\ndouble immersion in Japanese
and American design\nculture, Toru has--
over the past two\nand a half decades--
positioned his work\nat the intersection
of what are typically\ncompeting frameworks of design.
Ecologies mandate for\nheterogeneity on the one hand,
and minimalism on the other.
Or, as can be seen in\nthe exhibition outside,
a cross [? scaler ?] nimbleness\nthat enables the work
to express both system and\ncraft, figure and field,
and horizontality and extent\nacross careful measure.
Toru sustained\ncommitment to both design
and scholarly research, and\n[? through ?] creative practice
embody what I call the\ncomplete designer--
individuals who\ncontribute consistently
through their\nproductive careers,
with unwavering appetite\nfor the many forms
of knowledge that landscape\narchitecture demands.
Studio on Site has received many\nawards for many of the projects
that you see outside\nfrom many organizations,
including the Japan Institute\nof Landscape Architecture,
the Good Design Gold Award--
also a Japanese award--
the Architectural Institute of\nJapan, the Civil Engineering
Design Award, and\nthe Organization
for Landscape and Urban Green\nInfrastructure, to name a few.
It has been our pleasure to\nhave you here with us, Toru.
Please join me in welcoming\nthe 2017 Daniel Urban Kiley
lecturer, Toru Mitani.
[applause]
Excuse me, they are preparing.
And let me use this time\nfor my impression of the GSD
[inaudible] comparing.
When I was a student, it's\ngood impression of GSD.
You have a very good\ncommunity between departments.
When I was a student,\nit's kind of separated.
And I have option studio,\nand a student from landscape
architecture, and urban\ndesign or architecture--
we mix and talk together.
And always we have to work.
In the real [inaudible]\nwe have to work.
And always [? project ?]\ncollaboration.
You don't design by yourself.
Structure engineers and\nequipment designers.
It's good, but still I\nthink we should find out
each landscape architecture\nand the urban design.
See what's your standing point,\nand clear professional pride,
and clear differentiation\nof professions.
And let's make a\ngood collaboration.
So an option studio\nmixture is great,
but we need such a relationship.
And the other things, is now\nmay I tell this, [inaudible]??
You are so digitalized.
And when I ask the--
OK, coming-- but [inaudible]\njust I should talk [inaudible]..
When I ask the student to\nmake a model, they go down.
Just move your hand.
Modeling is a\nprocess of thinking.
Can I start?
Sure.
Now I [? having ?]\nthe true project.
OK, thank you very much\ntoday, and my lecture
is about exhibition\nlandscape-- fabric of detail.
It's obviously\nHalloween evening,
and more and more pumpkin\ncome out the street.
Made me nervous.
Because today is Halloween.
But I shouldn't spend\nsuch [inaudible]..
But I realized I can't\nfind this kind of pumpkin
so much, with details.
So I feel you are losing a very\ntraditional detailing craft,
so this is the best day\nto talk about the detail.
And details-- so when they\nstart the details study,
everyone said, oh, Toru, you are\nso [? architectonic, ?] you are
a landscape architect.
But I think some detail is\nvery [? much ?] over landscape
architecture.
For example, the rake pattern\non Zen Buddhist garden
is not ornament, as you know.
And not only the\nnarrative representation,
but it's very functional.
The engineering factors\n[? buckled ?] it.
I don't have time\nto talk about it.
But for example,\n[inaudible] Jingu, Kyoto,
east side of the pond there\nis this kind of stone work.
And they are talking a\nlot about the balance
of the large or small\nor medium size of stone.
But after the storm,\nif you go there,
it's working very\nwell as a strainer.
All leaves, twigs stop there,\nand not let them in the pond.
And the other thing\nis, why we don't
talk about details so much?
Because the\n[? part ?] of nature.
And it's very phenomenal,\nit's difficult to record
the drawings.
But such detail is,\nindeed, the essential part
for the space of a\nlandscape architect,
and succeeded by gardeners\nfor century and centuries.
So today I talk about the\ndetail of the surface, cloud,
and the reflection.
First project,\nKaze-no-Oka Crematorium.
It's the three-hectare park\nbesides the crematorium.
And it's a kind of upper\npart of the river terrace.
And this is my first sketch\nwhen I visited the site.
And I had the\nimpression that, oh,
that's a chance to\nmake Earthwork for me.
And it's worked very well\nfor the bold landscape,
this kind [? of. ?]\nFrom the beginning,
this is this kind of\n[? concaved ?] Earthwork I had
imagined.
And about [? 120 ?] and\n[? 50 ?] meter over Earthwork,
we call it Earth dish--
it's concaved.
And the challenge\nprovide a sense of void,
instead of the use\nfor the people.
And Earth dish-- this is\ntilted from east to west.
And north to south.
And first I designed\nthese Earthwork,
and when I [inaudible] started\nto [? tilt ?] his architecture
also like this.
So as a result of\nthis concaved earth,
is the space to spread\n[inaudible] for the funeral
and cremation.
Concave is good at creating\na distance like this.
As I expected, I was succeeded\nto have a [? borrowing ?]
landscape like this.
And edge, the [? perimeter ?]\nof the oval [? earthwork ?] is
the [? path ?] approaching\nthe [inaudible] crematorium.
But what I talk here, how\nto visualize the earth form,
and how to being aware\nof the earth's geometry.
And the clue in my project\nhere is these stitch line
you see, like this.
And as a matter of fact,\nthese parallel line
is a kind of template to guide\nour [inaudible] to come cut out
for him.
But actually, in\nthe construction,
we were surprised that\nit worked very well
to get the exact grading.
And we use these [inaudible],,\nbecause it is concaved.
And it's easy way to\nget the exact earth
form for the contractor.
The result was successful.
Without this kind of a line,\nyou don't see any appearance
of the surface of the earth.
Maybe it is just a large\nditch of the earth.
People love it,\nbut sometimes they
misunderstand it's a stepping\nstone to end up at the wall.
Depth of the path is\nimportant, I think.
For landscape architecture, the\npath is not just a [inaudible],,
it's a tool to show the\nsurface of the earth.
For example, I made maybe\none or two inch [? skirt, ?]
and a stand at the [inaudible]\nedge, and the stop to finish.
And I create space here,\ncreating the shadow.
And we made a lot of [? mark ?]\nup on [? the ?] side.
I expected it has a\nshadow like this here,
but unexpectedly,\nthe stainless edge
got the reflection of light.
And I was happy to\nshowing a sharp contrast
between the footpath\nand earth's surface.
And now this is up here\nafter [? 20 ?] years.
I visited last year.
And it's merging with\ngrass, and this [inaudible]
merging with the grass.
But still giving a sense\nof distance of a surface.
Also, the edge of the surface\nmust be treated very carefully,
I think.
But this kind of form is--
the contractor always\ncomplain to make this kind
of complicated [? form ?] work.
But I think it succeeded.
It looks like this-- it's\njust a one inch [? tall ?]
concrete edge, but shouldn't\nbe two inch or three inch,
I thought.
And sometimes it's sunken,\nand sometimes it's raised up.
And how much the\nheight of this rise--
if it's two inch or three\ninch-- must be very careful.
Otherwise, kind of\nsense of suffer,
you see [? old ?] shadow\nof these destroyed.
[? fontana-- ?] he\nis very conscious
about the frame of the canvas.
And he always has\na knife cut here.
So I looked for the chance\nto get a hole, or a slit,
and actually the center of the\n[? earthwork. ?] [inaudible]
There is a large basin\nfor the storm reservoir.
So I utilize it as\na hole and the slit,
and set the bench on it.
And actually, there\nis a [? anemometer ?]
at the south gate here, and\nmake sounds of wind bell.
And that sound [? brought ?]\ninto that well.
And they make a very subtle\nsmall sounds, a beautiful wind
sound, from the underground.
[? actually, ?] while in\nthe construction the city in
charge of this project\nwas worrying about--
Toru, this is crematorium,\nso no human voice
from the underground.
But finally we got\nvery good sounds.
And eventually, it was happening\nthat we encounter the real
[? earthwork, ?] ancient tomb.
So I took advantage of\nthese to make another sense
of the surface setting.
This is a indication\nof each tomb.
But I'm setting another\nlayer under the ground layer.
It's a good contrast, and\nrevealing the existing
of the earth surface.
So in this project, I\nlearned tiny depths, thinness
of the edge play with light.
And this continuous\nshadow is important detail
for creating the sense\nof spreading surface.
OK, next project, Fukui\nPrefectural Library,
with [? humiku ?]\n[? komaki ?] again.
It's chance to examine\nthe detail method of the
creating the sense of surface.
It's the middle of\na vast rice field.
But it's Prefectural Library,\na huge [? volume ?] come out.
So our strategy has a large\n[? mound ?] that east side
[? and south side ?]\nof the earth globe.
And here I try to\ndeal with the mound.
That's a large, four-meter\nhigh, large mound.
Has a tilted plane, instead\nof the huge volume, the mound.
Otherwise, that mound\nwould enclose this space,
and it interrupt the space\nspread out to the sky.
And then the surface with the\nfootpath provides a visual
measure to [? sound ?]\nthe distance,
[? like ?] making a frame.
Footpath is is making\nthe frame in landscape.
And my strategy is\nvery simple and subtle.
This parallel line is a\ntwo-inch shallow ditch,
and bring the water to the\ndrainage along the footpath.
So it's a part of\ndrainage system.
But it creates a shallow\nshadow at sunset time.
During the day\ninvisible, so sometimes
it appears to create\na sense of surface.
Peter Walker told\nme, I remember,
is that we landscape architects\nare soldier without any gun,
even [inaudible],, because\nwe have only earth, trees,
water-- that's all.
Nothing concrete,\nglass-- like architect.
In the south part, I\n[? played ?] a straight
[? path ?] with mound, and\ncreated a picturesque view.
But, again, the contractor\ncomplained to me.
Said, how to create such\na three-dimensional path?
So I told them, I don't know.
But they tried, and the\nresults were very good.
Now, kids like to have a bike or\nskateboarding or rollerskating
in here.
Anyway, the footpath is always\nthe heart of the landscape.
It means other\nelements, like those,
should be together\nintegrated with the footpath,
and [inaudible].
So sometimes I combined--
this is a basin rim.
This works as a reflector\nof the footlight.
And I have footlight\njust center of the path,
and the people go around.
This is a water supply.
It's all integrated\nin the footpath.
Then, [? they ?]\n[? in the plane, ?] nothing.
So why we need such an effort\nto create a sense of surface,
I asked me.
I think because we are\nusing a program or function
as an opportunity to review\nthe existence of a surface,
and the existence of earth.
So I like to talk about,\nnext, the detail of the cloud.
I titled the cloud,\nbut just literally
saying [? the woods. ?]\nFirst, I would like introduce
the Okutama Forest Therapy.
It's the project\namong the crowd--
in other words,\namong the forest.
And if I talk about\nforest therapy.
Forest therapy totally\ndifferent from hiking [? way, ?]
or a climbing--
even different from\nthe forest bathing.
It's a kind of medical\ntreatment based
on the proof and evidence.
So they need a flat\nand a wider way.
And so the trail is\nnot actually path,
it's a place to have a rest,\n[? have a lot of program. ?]
The site is along the\nvalley here, like this.
And it's a small\nproject, and 1,200 meter
trail around the [inaudible].
The trail has a\n[? free ?] station
we call the architectural\nfacilities--
for the explanation of\n[inaudible] or other program.
Sometimes they have\nwooden stove counseling,
like [inaudible] here,\nhearing the water,
the sounds of the stream.
And between those\nstations, we prepared--
we required the place\nfor the many kinds
of program of [? rain ?] down,\nthe workshop, and the yoga,
or like that.
So for getting the\nwider, flat path--
at the beginning, we\nthought it's simple, easy.
Because if we have the\npath along the contour,
we get a flat path.
But in the reality, these\nmountain-- hillside in Tokyo--
is very steep like this.
So we have to make the peaceful\ntherapy trail, but long,
long retaining wall.\n[? one ?] meter,
we need a two meter high\nretaining [? wall. ?]
So what should we do?
We are really confused.
And the solution is use\nthese retaining walls
as a part of furniture.
It gives the appearance\n[? of ?] retaining on this
[? furniture. ?] It's simple.
It's just setting this kind\nof steel net sitting bench.
Then the retaining wall\nlooks like furniture,
don't you think so?
[laughing]
But still, we have\nnext obstacle--
low-budget.
This is public sector,\npublic project,
so we couldn't have any\nspecial detail or design.
Everything must be standard.
And my partner, Yuuji\nSuzuki, is incredible.
He found somewhere a kind\nof timesaver you're using,
the standard construction,\nthe forest civil engineering.
That's this book.
So he said, Toru, just\ncopy it, copy this.
And it gets down the cost\nestimation drastically, yes.
So what we did--
the structure is same.
But what we did is just\ngoing back on the site
many, many times, telling to the\ncontractors, please face these
logs.
Please align the bolts.
Please cut straight.
[laughing]
Otherwise, they're\njust contracting
the standard details, and looks\nso ugly, and it's not peaceful.
Because they don't think such\na kind of civil engineering
can provide designed space.
This plaza is used at night\nto watch the starlight.
That's very popular.
I'm very glad.
But they gave this\nplaza a strange name.
It\'s "Wild Planetarium."
Don't you think?
Right.
But I'm very glad that that\nstandard detail gives a chance
to people to lay down and\nwatch up the trees and the sky
beyond it.
So simply find\nmaterial and unifying
the details is the\nshortest way to cost down.
So here, everything\nmade of lumber
from the forest thinning.
For example, this kind of deck\nfor the [inaudible],, tables,
and [? arm ?] basin, we call.
And it is for the\nprogram, cooling down
the blood pressure.
Bring back the stream water\nhere and cool down the arms.
Or some part, overhang\ndeck, is also lumber.
And after we made\na lot of effort
to creating this retaining\nwall, the Forest Therapy program
again, required me, we\nneed more wider space.
So we had to prepare this\nkind of floated deck.
It's also made by the log,\nthe same kind of detail.
They used-- this suite is for\na place, various workshops
on consulting.
And this is my\nfirst study model.
And didn't like it, because\nthis kind of usual structure
contained a shadow--
large shadow and a\ndarker place on the deck.
And I have a feeling\nthat many spiders here.
[laughing]
So the structure we used is this\nlattice, triangular structure.
And the angle of the structure,\ngiving the good design
of the handrail, too.
And it gives-- this kind could\nbe possible by that lattice
structure floating deck.
And it's a shelter.
We call it shelter.
It's almost simple\ncombination of logs,
because we don't have\nany other materials.
So all these logs tied\n[? here ?] by L-shaped angles
and tied up by a joint bar--
joint bolt, maybe.
And sometimes, this shelter\nsank down under the deck,
creating a private space\nfor personal counseling,
or such a kind of\nthing, talking.
And white cubic shelter\nworks as a kind of--
OK, I should push this button.
The white shelters\nwork as a marking point
on the long trail, because\nit's good for the person.
Sometimes, they have, in\nthe condition mentally weak,
so they are afraid to\nget in the dark forest.
So we provide a very\nbright place to,
this is the distance\nwe should go.
And for an experiment, I set\none of shelter far out of path
in the wood.
But today, it's a popular place.
A kind of couple--
Nice.
And here, I would show, under\nthe standard civil engineering
detail, it's a stone wall.
It's using the riverside stones.
It's very vernacular in\nJapan, or very popular.
We can see this kind of\nstone anywhere in Japan.
But I never see it designed.
So I had a simple\ntreatment using
this drainage line, cross\ndrainage and vertical drainage.
But I set those drainage\nat the polygonal line
for the folded retaining\nwall, just that.
But it now looks like\nthe structure for space.
At station three, the\nwall is integrated
with the architecture.
It means a kind of marriage\nof art form and architecture
space.
We intentionally closed\nthe interior space
toward the forest but\nopened up to the stone,
because I like people see\nthe stone wall I make.
[laughing]
So everyone watching\nthe stone wall.
But it makes a soft reflection.
Light of the reflection--\nit's coming in the room,
makes the room bright.
But still again, here--
I visited this many, many times.
Some of the stone work\ncontractors-- that's
your work, that's your work!
But he didn't understand.
He just worked as I told.
I learned a kind of conclusion.
The key is not what\nthe structure is,
but how the light and\nshadow condition is.
How is it revealed\nby these structures?
And it depends on the\nway of forest thinning
and where we have a open space.
It's decided the\ndirection of the light.
And more importantly,\nthese structures
reflect the movement, or the\nfluctuation of the light.
That's very important\nfor rest and therapy.
And more about the structure.
It's set there to reveal the--
sometimes, it's a duplicate\nof the movement, fluctuation,
above air and at the foot.
So it's an amplified\nfluctuation.
All detailed effort for\nit simply sees results--
low cost.
Very important.
And the simplicity\nreveals the nature
of the cloud of landscape.
I learned that for a\nproject [inaudible]..
The next file.
Now in creating the\ncloud in the city,
the first project is\nShinagawa Central Garden.
But actually, this model is a\nconcept model I made in 1992.
It's the middle of Tokyo.
Shinagawa station, large\nShinkansen station.
And they had a large\ndevelopment, and eventually--
that time, I came\nback from America.
So this is my first concept\nmodel, just using pins,
while developers are\ndiscussing how to use
this open space for the people.
So I brought in this model.
Lets use the space for trees.
I'm a landscape\narchitect, you know.
[laughing]
So this is my first scheme.
But actually,\nconstruction in 2003--
we have almost 13 years.
And while those 13\nyears, a lot of people
brought in-- oh, Toru, why don't\nwe use the space for events,
kids' garden?
And they said a rose garden,\nand some hills, and parks.
No, I said, let's fill the\ndisplays with just trees.
So this is the final plan.
I compromised.
I filled up the trees.
And always, we\nhave to compromise
with the people and the client.
But it developed\nthe scheme a lot.
I have a lot of\nvariation of the plaza.
But all the trees\nline up, actually.
And it's concave again.
This is the result in 2003.
Except 242 Cercidiphyllum\nand Quercus, nothing special.
In other words, no program.
Instead of program in\nthe center of the city,
I think it's our responsibility\nof landscape architect.
I am happy to see today actually\nmany, many people sitting down
under the canopy,\nas you can see.
And I'd like to [? study ?]\nagain of detail.
The elements, so the motif\nbreak through this scheme,
is this tree bar, I called.
One tree bar contains\nfive Cercidiphyllum.
And it is a band of floated\nPC panel, as you see,
the CPC panel.
And protecting the root\nenvironment from compression.
So I repeated that tree bands\nalong the 40,000-meter mall,
and it gets unity.
But each place has a\ndifferent kind of pavement--
sometimes just gray.
In parts, it's just flat\nwith other pavement.
In some other parts, the tree\nbar plays with green mounds.
But the repetition gives\nfive Cercidiphyllum laws.
And that regularity\nappears at evening
by the lighting pattern.
Because I set all lighting\nand the bench on the tree bar.
So tree bar have\neverything again,
and other personal elements.
This is a diagram--
the relationship of plaza\nand I [? say ?] cloud here.
The pitch of 6 meter\nby 6.5 is decided
of the size of Cercidiphyllum.
But finally, I realize, it's\nvery good Japanese privacy,
or private use of\npeople enjoying
their each private\nspace under the trees,
and a good distance for them.
So good for Cercidiphyllum\nmeans good for us.
I remember this time, Laurie\nOlin told in the field trip
in Philadelphia, the pavement\ndesign is for the trees.
It is a screen of their shadow.
Here's a pavement-- it's a\nscreen for the tree shadows.
I remember that Laurie\nOlin told that to us.
I found this old sketch\nin my sketchbook.
Traffic in structure\nunderground,
and a variety of people\nuse on [? grade. ?]
But the identity of the place\nrealized of cloud above it.
There are seven [? follies ?]\namong the grove.
You see, these, we call\nthese [? follies. ?]
They are actually the exhaust,\nor inlet intake tower,
for the underground\ntraffic system.
Frames are finished\nby black, or polished,
or rusted stainless steel.
Black make a frame,\nbut the polished part,
you have a reflection of trees.
Means they increase the\ntexture of the clouds.
Here, one [? follies, ?] the\npolished side duplicated,
triplicated the sense of cloud.
Water features are also\ndesigned for such reflection.
I realized, when all those\nfinishing details are unified
very well, the pattern\nof groves could
be increased and increased.
And it makes the space filled\nby the fluctuation of the cloud.
We keep the relationship\nwith the maintenance gardener
very well.
And we have this kind of chart.
This is bad trimming,\nthis is good trimming.
So trimming advising--\nthe discussion
is very important\nthrough the maintenance.
It's another detail design.
Today, through those\nefforts, the Cercidiphyllum
are growing fine and turning\norange and yellow together
with them.
And I love the texture and the\ncolor of the Cercidiphyllum.
In winter, they have the\nbeautiful red [inaudible]..
Deciduous tree is a totally\ndifferent space composition
of the evergreen.
Dialogue with roots.
I love this book.
Maybe [inaudible]\nLibrary has this.
I don't know.
It's illustrations of tree roots\nby Dr. [? noboru ?] Karizumi.
He devoted all his life\nto research on roots
and illustrated.
It's a good, very\nexciting encyclopedia.
When I was young,\nI was so conscious
about the differentiation\nof plane and tree trunk.
But after 30 years,\ncame back in Cambridge,
I really appreciate this--
brick pavement is very\nflexible and looseness
for root [? race. ?]\nIt's a kind of dialogue
between the city and trees.
So that's a Cambridge landscape.
Sometimes, I express\nroot conditions
of existing trees like this.
This is a renovation of the\nold factory, the architect,
[inaudible] has some\nexhibition presentation rooms.
And we spread out very\ngeometrical lawn place,
grass place.
But actually, obviously, the\ngeometric [? earth ?] plane
does not fit with the height\nlevel of these existing trees.
So we had expressed such\na kind of differentiation
and how much root area there\nis, and have some detail design.
Sometimes, the trees\nlower our geometry
and preparing good\ndrainage for tree health.
And just designing the\nefficient root treatment
with careful details--
that's enough to design\nthe landscape architecture,
I think, space.
And a recent urban project--
this is [? machida ?] City Hall?
Yes.
I am interested to\nexpress such a dialogue
with the roots and the city.
Expressing and emphasizing\nthe scale of roots--
this is [? cerco ?] biserrata.
And those roots area\ngives a symbolic icon
in the front of the plaza.
And people enjoy those\nspace under the canopies.
In fact, in urban\nconstruction, we
prepare a lot of engineering\nfor root conditioning.
And not only the\nsupport, not only
the drainage, not only the\nirrigation, aeration tube,
or aggregate, rooting system--
we have a lot of things.
But all those efforts\nare hidden, so I like to,
there is such a kind of\neffort under the ground.
And sometimes, we bring our\ndesign into a productization,
in catalogue.
It is another way keep\nthe construction cost low.
It's product.
For example, these fan-shaped\nPC support each other
in this kind of\nshallow cone shape.
Create a large space under it.
It must be a shallow\ncone, so I expect
this keeps people realize\nwalking on it-- oh, this is--
we are walking on the roots.
Thank you very much.
[laughing]
Thank you, trees,\ngiving the space for us.
So those engineering\nresults, the creation
of the air of the cloth,\nroot and cloth, is combined.
Sometimes, I mulch\n[inaudible] trees a lot
according to the Michael\nVan Valkenburgh's advice.
[laughing]
Only one is laughing at that!
We are all the students, yeah.
I will go to next slides.
I titled it "Details\nfor Reflection,"
but simply, I'm talking\nabout water features.
And here, I introduce\njust ongoing projects.
So no after the\nconstruction photograph.
Most recent project,\nthis is Shigeru Ban.
We won the competition Heritage\nCenter of the Mountain Fuji.
This is a stream flows\nright next to the site.
The Sengen Shrine has a\nbeautiful fountain from Mt.
Fuji, and the stream runs\ndown along the approach.
And the site's just\nbeside the stream--
oh, that's a nice site,\nwe thought, actually.
But in reality, it's surprising.
The site is here,\nand the stream, here.
And there is a shrine gate.
And this large parking lot not\nincluded in the competition.
[laughing]
That's awful!
And we went to the site.
[laughing]
Stream over there,\nsite behind the fence.
This is out of sight.
So I told Shigeru Ban, let's\nforget about the competition,
to win the competition.
It's kind of rude--
getting the first\nprize and just, no way.
So we just spread\nout the sheet of--
OK.
Spread out the sheet of water\nand continued the [inaudible]
on center to the stream\nby the water feature.
And we forget about\nthe competition.
But finally, the committee\nchose our idea for first prize.
Then after that, the\nprefecture and the city
has to purchase that parking\nlot for their project.
But I said, thank you very much.
[laughing]
But now, again,\nthe public project,
and they need a budget\nfor buying the land.
So very low-budget.
So all my fault.
It's very simple,\njust a sheet of water.
And all my effort--
it's clear sheet of water.
And detail of the\nedge and creating
large, quiet sheet of water.
[? boston ?] [inaudible]\nhas a very simple space
configuration, and expression\nis a wall and a plate,
horizontality.
But I think it's his detail--
overhanging the paving on\nthe water is successful.
Otherwise, if you have\nvertical water [? here, ?]
it's just a container\nof the wall.
But now here, the sheet\nof water is an expression,
it's a horizontality\nof the material.
And Scarpa.
Yeah, I should go here.
Scarpa.
It's his magician of creating\nthe shadow on the water
and sometimes under the water.
And he has a lot of layers\nbetween eight-inch thickness
of water and having\na lot of layers.
And emphasizing the\ngreen is one surface.
We learned a lot\nfrom the Scarpa.
And also, [inaudible]\nis so successful.
He has, again, the same detail,\noverhanging on the water.
So stone side-- never wet.
And it looks like\nfloated over the water.
So we feel the weight,\nthickness, of the stone
so much.
The shadow works very well.
And we challenge to see how we\ncan make this shadow minimal.
But it's a huge water, so water\ncirculation is a huge amount.
And what's the minimum size?
We calculated with\nthe engineer a lot.
And how we combined the\nconcrete structure and a steel
structure, make these stone\nfinishes as much as [? same. ?]
Now it's in the spring,\nconstruction starts.
And Shigeru Ban\nstarted his structure,
and we combine with his\ncolor, chose a lot of stone.
I think we chose this\nstone from China.
And now, the architecture\nalmost finished.
Now, interior construction.
And our site, the landscape slab\nis starting the construction.
See this.
Now, if we had followed\nthe competition regulation,
the [inaudible] circumstances\n[? look ?] like this.
But today, now we\nhave a large plate.
I'm waiting, looking for to\nsee the simple water feature
has a reflection of this\nshape, [inaudible] Shigeru Ban.
This is another ongoing project.
It's a research\ncenter in Yamagata.
It's a very northern\npart of Japan.
It's countryside.
This is the site.
It's a beautiful rice\nfield, and the vastness.
And our concept model like this.
Our proposal is overlaying\nthe facilities, architecture
facilities, on the existing\nrice field with minimum impact,
with minimum disturbance.
So to the client, we have this\nkind of presentation model.
Just-- we slipped the\nphotograph of the rice field
under our model.
This is spring, rice\nfield is green in summer.
And beautiful golden\nsurface in the autumn.
And still, in the winter,\nthe white surface--
beautiful.
And in the early spring,\nthey have seeding, a lot
of nitrogen-fixed groundcover.
In Japan, we have a lot of\npinkish flowers in the rice
field.
So please see this.
Rice field is definitively\nJapanese primary landscape
in mind.
And this image I\nam showing is now
is [inaudible] that I\ndid for two years ago.
So I like.
But the people living\nin the countryside
don't care about anything of it.
It's just farmland.
But it's the strongest\nexpression of the landscape.
For the layout\nplan like this, we
employ the traditional\nformation of the farmer's house
and grove, characteristics\nof landscape.
We realize it's in scale.
And the same scale of our\nfacilities and the existing
farmer's house.
So we started the\nsurvey of the existing
windbreak and domestic species.
[? almost ?] Quercus, or\nCastanopsis, or like that.
Sometimes the [inaudible]\ncypress and conifers, mixed.
And we found a wooden fence\nremained there with the trees,
at the foot of the trees.
Maybe, we guessed, and\nwe had an interview,
they used this\nkind of wood fence
to protect the small trees\nwhen you set the windbreak.
And after the tree\ngrow, then stop the wind
at the foot of tree, they\nuse this kind of defense.
So I decided we design it.
Our next is nothing [inaudible].
You It's a kind of serendipity\nfor landscape architect,
always, when we\nstep in this site.
I think it's a\nkind of wild poppy.
So we thought this\nkind of long wood fence
will be a primary landscape\nelement in [? all ?] stage
of the tree growth.
So carefully, but in inexpensive\nway-- that's important--
we study the detail of\ntheir construction method.
As a matter of fact, that fence\nwas experimentally applied
at the center of Tokyo\nBay to create a forest
for future development.
Inside, we planted baby\ntrees for future forests
with everyone.
We employed every student in\nmy school, and the contractor,
and architects,\nlandscape architects.
Also, the client, the\npresident, also planting.
We worked together.
And now, just the\nfence is visible.
Behind the fence,\nwe have baby trees.
But it has a good contrast\nwith the center of Tokyo,
beyond Tokyo Bay.
One important concept we\ndiscussed with the developer
here is how to keep the\nvacant lot as aesthetical
in the landscape during the\nlong, long, slow development.
Today, the city, as you\nknow-- very slow developing,
very slow.
So we have, always,\na lot of vacant lots.
And they see this--\njust vacant lot.
But must be a good landscape.
So I thought the fence\ndesign is a clue.
Then, as a matter of\nfact, some art curator
called younger artists.
Like this, used my fence--
tree nursery.
Some experimental art\nfestival, they have.
One of the fence is painted\nby a graphic artist like this.
But anyway, this is celebrating\nthe nursery, the baby trees,
and celebrating the vacant\nlot under the process
of slow urban development.
Let's come back, again,\nthe Yamagata Prefecture,
for the rice field.
So now the story of the rice\nfield besides those house
groves.
Now, I was so curious,\nthe water network
you see in the\nrice fields-- there
is a very complicated\nwater network.
And also, it's not farmer's\nconcern, but inlet, outlet,
or overflow channel--
those grids, so nice\nmusic of the water.
It's very small sound,\nbut while you are walking,
it's beautiful sounds of water.
So rice fields filled\nby the sounds of water.
But sometimes, too\nmany, they have.
It's mysterious.
So now, our design-- most\neffort is layout of the channel.
Where is the irrigation?
Where is the overflow?
And creating the details\nof outlet, inlet,
and overflow to create good\nsounds of water and echo.
And also-- oh, I\nremember another thing
I learned from Hideo Sasaki.
We are walking on Hawaii.
Hideo told me that, Toru,\nwater is not material.
Water is sounds and reflection.
That's the phrase I\nremember from Hideo.
And also, we are\ndiscussing to bring back
the traditional water\nnetwork with this kind
of small reservoir.
This small reservoir keeps the\nheterogeneous species, insects
and animals, under the snow.
But modernized rice field don't\nuse this kind of reservoir.
So all insects-- they have died.
It's still ongoing project.
I hope we can recreate again\nthe rice fields landscape.
Thank you very much.
And for the conclusion,\nthe fabric of detail.
Yeah, I should have--
sorry.
I was asking him\nto open the file,
and forgetting I opened it.
Detail and landscape--\nthese two words
stand in a vastly\ndifferent scale, I think.
But any beautiful fabric\nis just the result
of the careful, simple,\ncreative, detailed process
like this.
It's string and fabric.
And I love the Grant\nWood paintings.
And also, the famous\npainting of the countryside.
As you say, Grandma Moses?
Anna Moses?
Now, what is the difference?
I do not like so much\nAnna's paintings.
What's the difference?
West of America,\neast of America.
But it's about material,\nphysical space.
But she is expressing\nthe people's daily life,
the happiness, and the culture.
Professor Mark [? tribe ?]\nwriting about this well.
So Wood's painting is\nabout, again, the earth.
The reason he is showing--\nthe reason all these details,
and the process of the detail--
it's almost like engineering\n[inaudible],, I think.
More importantly, how the\npersistence on this detail
makes essential sense\nof the landscape.
It's scale and distance.
Landscape fabric of details.
Once the process of\ndetail is defined,
it suddenly spreads out\nand creates a world,
almost leaving people\nbehind without human scale.
Such a solitude of landscape\nprovides me witness of sublime,
or another world, you say.
That's the reason why I\nworked on detail so much.
Thank you.
[laughing]
[applause]
Thank you, Toru.
That was brilliant, as always.
Toru will take some questions\nfrom the audience, please?
Here is one right here.
In the Mt.
Fuji Heritage\nCenter, in the model,
what materials did you use to\nget that beautiful reflection
in the model?
The reason?
The materials.
Material?
It's [inaudible]
In the model.
Are you asking the\nmaterial of the slab?
In the model.
Oh, in the model!
[laughing]
So you'll actually\nuse it for your model!
[laughing]
I will teach you.
Please use black cardboard\nand prepare the silver spray.
And the dust of the silver\nspray on the black plate.
Now it looks like granite.
[laughing]
That's your question?
That's important, is detail.
[laughing]
Yes.
But so I told you,\nshouldn't be digitalized.
Because making model\nprocess and sometimes,
you find a different\nviewpoint from the model.
And for example,\nif you digitalized,
you got the shape you imagined.
But while you are making\nthe model by yourself,
you're getting the\nshape, unconscious shape,
from the other side.
So input the data\nin the computer,
and if it comes out\nfrom the 3D model maker,
where is the dust going?
Sometimes, dust\nis very important,
the other parts of the material.
Oh, I shouldn't talk\nso much about it.
OK, next question.
Yes.
Thank you, it's beautiful work.
Looking at the\nforest therapy path,
I found myself worrying about--\nif that were to be done here,
worrying about two things--
safety and ADA compliance.
And so I wonder how those issues\ncome up for you in the work
that you do in Japan.
Questions of--
[speaking japanese]
Yeah, sometimes my\nhearing device--
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, I understand.
That's very important.
When I was working in the\nhotel, a resort hotel in Hawaii,
some details were\ndecided by insurance.
I thought, oh, this is America.
[laughing]
But anyway, in the\nOkutama Therapy,
yes, we required a\nlot of handrails.
And for landscape architecture,\nhow to deal with handrails
is very important,\nbecause when you sit down,
the handrail just\ncomes to your eye level
and interrupts all of the view.
And in Okutama Forest\nTherapy, some parts,
we set handrails for safety,\nbut the other parts, no.
So we discussed a lot\nwith the instructor
of the Forest Therapy.
And actually, that space\nnow used for elder people
and health wellness.
And sometimes, we prepared that\nflat surface so the wheelchair.
And there is a stream.
And we tried to make a\nbridge over the wider
stream with the handrail, but\nwe decided not to construct it.
We just let the stream\ngoing, and only the handrail
on the stream.
So people just\ngrab the handrail.
They walk on the rocky stream.
So I don't know.
Yes, safety is very important,\nbut sometimes, people
should protect their\nown self by [inaudible]..
It's a dialogue between--
I don't like to be sued.
[laughing]
But it's very important.
If I continue all handrail along\nthe trail, it kills the space,
I think.
Thank you very much,\nasking about handrail.
Even in the studio, we are\nteaching the 100 scale--
please think about handrail.
There's a question here.
Sure.
I was interested\nin the way that you
were talking about the\ncrematorium project,
and the way that the architect\nwas reacting to the landscape
and tilting the building.
Can you talk about\nthat a little bit more?
What was that relationship?
[speaking japanese]
Oh, OK, all right.
Yeah, with the microphone,\nmy hearing doesn't--
yes, because it's\ncomplicated process.
At first, he got the\nproject of a crematorium.
I was just designed\na garden around it.
But after a year, the city\npurchased the next land,
get some budget\nfrom the country.
And they decided\nto create a park.
And park project go\nahead of his crematorium.
So we decided [inaudible]\nand tilt it like this.
So then after my\ndesign, Fumihiko Maki
started his design.
So it's lucky he\nliked my design.
And he adjusted his\narchitecture to the artwork.
So I tilted, so he tilted.
[laughing]
That's the question\nyou'd like, no?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But sometimes, or most projects,\narchitect decides everything.
And sometimes under\nthe construction,
they call, Toru, come and\nplease plant the tree here.
Already, everything is set.
But in such a case,\nI can't enjoy it.
I interpret, or I read\nthe architect's mind,
what he likes to do and what\nkind of space he likes to make.
And I try to show a little bit\ndifferent aspect of his concept
from the landscape architecture.
So it's a conversation in\nany stage between architect
and landscape architecture.
Yeah.
Hi.
You showed a couple of images\nof the Scarpa Tomb Brion.
You showed a couple of\nimages of the Tomb Brion.
[speaking japanese]
Yes.
Were there other aspects of that\nthat have influenced your work?
[speaking japanese]
I had the impression\nthat Scarpa--
the tomb, Scarpa's cemetery,\nis very landscape architecture.
Because he set some tombs\nfor the families, brothers,
but the space is defined\nby the raised green plate.
So I learned a lot how\nhe makes the grass area
as a plane instead\nof just earth.
For example-- I couldn't show\nthat, but maybe you know.
The raised edge\nof the grass area
is very thin, almost one inch.
And he is interesting.
He didn't hide the detail of\nthe retaining wall in the earth.
He exposed the retaining\nwall, the basements
of the retaining wall, thicker.
So he is showing\nthe technique, how
he get the very thin\nedge of the earth plate.
So I learned a lot\nfrom his that work
from how to show\nthe plane itself
as an object instead\nof just earth.
That's what I\nlearned from a lot.
Always, the edge is important\nfor a landscape architect.
If we have a thicker\nedge, it's not edge.
Already did frame, contained\neverything, like frame
of the old paintings.
OK?
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you asking, yes.
You talked about\nthe responsibility
of landscape architects.
I want to know if you think\nthat this kind of responsibility
has already changed\nnowadays from 30 years ago.
As a profession of a landscape\narchitect from 30 years ago?
Same.
It's what should we\ndo as a landscape
architect for the society?
Yeah, because I just\ntalk about aesthetics.
And all projects have the social\n[inaudible] and economic goal,
and what kind of\ncontribution we can do.
But I think the\nmost important thing
is to create the\n[? meeting ?] place.
The city is for function,\nprograms, how to use,
what kind of activity raises\nthe price of the land.
And the people thinking\nabout programs.
But when we walk along the\nCharles River, no program.
So it's very difficult\nto get the design fee
to create nothing.
[laughing]
But it's one of the landscape\narchitect's responsibilities.
Let's just leave it--
natural conservation is fine.
Don't use there.
That decision is\nvery good design.
But even if you design\nsomething, nothing, just trees,
it releases the mind of\nthe city people, I think.
It's the same in 30\nyears ago, 50 years ago,
and 100 years later, I think.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you, again, Toru, for\na fantastic presentation.
[applause]
Please join us for a\nreception in the exhibition.
Thank you, again.
