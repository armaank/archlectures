Good evening and welcome.
My name is Mohsen Mostafavi.
I'm the Dean of the\nGraduate School of Design,
and, really, my\nrole here tonight
is just to welcome you,\nand say how glad we are,
how delighted we are\nthat you are all here.
I know there are so many\nwonderful individuals, so
many dignitaries.
We are, of course,\nvery delighted
that Mayor Mancera is going to\nbe giving the keynote speech
tonight, and, of course, I'm\nso delighted and so happy
that you're here.
I'm also very grateful\nto Professor Diane Davis,
the chair of the Department\nof Urban Planning and Design
and who has asked me\nto say a few words--
and to my friend and\ncolleague Professor
George Dominguez,\nwho will, of course,
be introducing the mayor.
But thank you all for being\nhere and for giving me
this opportunity.
Because there will be a\nnumber of introductions
I will be very, very brief\nbeyond just saying welcome,
and it's wonderful\nthat you're here.
Just to say a couple\nof things, one,
is that we really, really,\nreally love Mexico,
and that's very important\nfor you to know.
And we are absolutely\ndedicated to working together
with you, to have\nstudents from Mexico,
to do projects in Mexico.
And this is what we do,\nso this is not a promise.
It's something\nthat we do, and we
would like to continue this\nproject in an even more
energetic fashion in\nthe years to come.
And, of course,\nit's also fantastic
that we have the friendship,\nthe connections with the David
Rockefeller Center, with\nall the great people who
work in the center who really\nmake it possible for us
to do projects in Mexico.
And so, we're really grateful\nto our colleagues there.
We are also very much to\nplace, at this university,
and there are many other\nplaces, but it's very much
the place that's really focused\non questions of urbanization,
on the future of cities,\non the role of planning
in terms of the\nimprovement of the cities.
And, of course, the\ntopic of this conference
that you will be holding\nhere-- starting tonight
with the mayors keynote and with\nthe conversations tomorrow--
is at the heart of the\nthinking, and the research,
and the investigation, and\nthe dedication of our students
to this question of\nurbanization broadly.
There is a dilemma.
We urbanize, we improve\nthings, we grow.
But the very concept\nof growth itself
produces the necessity for the\nutilization of more resources,
and this is something that,\nas designers, but also
for the mayor as\nsomeone who's really
dealing with the\nleadership of a city,
you have to really deal\nwith this conundrum
of the entire relationship\nbetween the project
of urbanization and the project\nof resource utilization.
More and more we are also\nin the context of a society,
and we, in the United\nStates, are very much
facing this situation\nright now, politically,
where there seems\nto be an increasing
desire for a kind\nof forced amnesia
towards the consequences\nof climate change.
And it's great that tonight,\nwith the mayor's talk,
we are actually addressing\nthis topic head on,
and understanding what are\nthe ways in which cities
and the political leadership of\nvarious cities really address
not only the question\nof creating better
environments for\ntheir citizens but how
do they do that in the\nlight of the challenges
that we face, for example,\nthrough this question
of climate change.
So I think this is\nthe right location.
This is the right place to be\nhosting this event with you,
and we're really grateful\nthat you have agreed
to do this before with us.
And the last thing\nI want to say is
that we do not want,\nas an institution,
to be only an academic\ninstitution that
is focusing on inward looking\nand keeping their knowledge
and information to ourselves.
We are very interested in the\ninteraction between the Academy
and real life.
And, in that sense,\nworking with the mayor,
working with Mexico City\nas part of a commitment
that we've made--
also to work with the\nleadership of a number of cities
where we feel that\nthe inter-relationship
between the work of the school\nand the real work that happens
in these cities is\nvery important as part
of a reciprocal relationship\nbetween the Academy
and real world in a way.
So we're really delighted\nto have this opportunity
to host the conference\nhere, and I would now
like to ask Professor Diane\nDavis to come and make
the second introduction before\nGeorge Dominguez introduces
the mayor.
Thank you.
I was mentioning to the\ndean that this series
of introductions is a very\nMexican style event because we
go from the hierarchies and\nthere are so many introductions
before we get to the\nmain speaker tonight.
You already know who I am.
I'm Diane Davis.
I also happen to be the chair of\nthe faculty committee on Mexico
and Central America DRCLAS.
I'm really excited to be in\nthat post because many of you
know that I have studied Mexico\nand Mexico City practically
my entire academic life.
So when I was asked to be\ninvolved more in DRCLAS,
I said, gladly, and they\nalso stepped up to the plate
to help support this event.
So I really want to thank--
well, Brian is not here--\nthe director of DRCLAS--
and Ned, and Rachel, and all\nthe staff over there for help
making this possible.
I also have to add one more\nthing to my otherwise prepared
remarks is I am just\nso excited and thrilled
to see Cuauhtemoc Cardenas here,\nthe very first democratically--
elected mayor of Mexico\nCity after Mexico City
started moving towards\ndemocratization
and having mayors appointed\nby the president for decades.
That democratization of the\ncity was a very important step
in the national\npolitical history.
And Cuauhtemoc, you're so\nimportant to many people,
both in Mexico and abroad.
I'm really happy\nthat you're here.
I'm not going to\ntalk too long, but I
do want to say a little\nsomething about--
not to repeat what Mohsen said--\nbut the kinds of questions,
the issues that the mayor is\naddressing in Mexico City are
the things that we are\nstruggling with here
at the GSD--
thinking about urban ecological\nand territorial challenges
facing the cities and\nthe peoples of the globe.
But, in particular,\nLatin America,
we're a very global\ninstitution here at the GSD.
We work in our own\nbackyard, but we also
work all around the world.
And we have great\ninvolvement in Latin America
because we have\ncollegial relationships
with faculty in Latin America.
Mexico, in particular,\nthe UNAM is
one of the major architectural\ninstitutions in all
of Latin America, and we have\nlots of good relationships
with former students--
just met one when\nI was in Mexico
the last week that\njust got tenure
in the architecture department.
And we hope to\ncontinue to work more
with the institutions, academic,\nas well as public sector
institutions, and,\notherwise, in the days,
and the months, and\nthe years ahead.
Among the concerns that motivate\nour students and faculty
are those relating to\ngrowth, and urbanization,
and environmental precarity,\nas the dean has already
underscored.
I think that we have\nto remember that these
are questions that are on\neverybody's mind these days.
Problems like\nclimate change are--
on one hand, we think\nabout climate change
as a global problem, but they're\nnot always easily or adequately
addressed by\nnational governments
as we've seen here in the last\ncouple of days with the Trump
administration.
The dilemma of national\ngovernments not always
stepping it up to\nthe plate to solve
urban problems and\nenvironmental problems
means that other\npolitical leaders
acting at different\nsovereignty scales
must step into the breach.
And this is where\ncity mayors are
becoming critically important.
In fact, today, I\ndon't know if you
saw, that there was a long\nop-ed in the New York Times
by former New York City\nMayor Michael Bloomberg,
on precisely this issue,\nreminding us that cities have
an important role to\nplay in moving the policy
agenda on climate change\nand other key issues.
Our speaker tonight,\nMayor Mancera,
is one of those\nextraordinary mayors.
He has cemented his reputation\nas a global leader working
with other mayors around the\nworld, including Paris's Mayor
Anne Hidalgo, and\nex Mayor Michael
Bloomberg, and other mayors,\nin raising consciousness
in spearheading\naction to address
environmental and other\nkey challenges of our times
both in those global\nconversation circles but
as well as in Mexico City.
I might also add that\nMayor Mancera has also
enabled an historic change\nin governance in Mexico City,
standing at the helm of\nthe recent introduction
of a new constitution.
And we're going to hear more\nabout that in the conference
tomorrow, so I\nhope everybody here
is going to be at the\nfull day event tomorrow.
And I would say that these types\nof governance changes, which
empower cities vis-a-vis\nnational authorities will
continue to be\nnecessary if mayors
are going to be able to\naccomplish their visionary
aims.
And, like I said, we can\ndiscuss that, as well as
some of the other environmental\nand infrastructure problems
that the mayor is facing,\nthat residents of Mexico City
are facing, during\nthe day tomorrow--
with many of the people in\nthe audience will be speakers.
I also should add,\nfor those of you
who don't know the Mexican\nintellectual and political
context, we have\nan amazing array
of people that are kind of\nthe top tier of the thinkers
about questions of the\ncity, politics, governance,
and society, and\nit's going to be
a really wonderful conference.
I hope you will all be here--
not here, it's in another\nbuilding at 10:00 AM tomorrow,
and it's in the program.
So I'm not going to go into an\nextended introduction of Mayor
Mancera's career and\nbackground because I'm
going to turn that over to\nProfessor Jorge Dominguez, who
will be making the\nintroduction to the mayor.
So let me just say a little\nsomething about Jorge.
Well, I may have made my career\nby studying the urban politics
of Mexico City.
Jorge Dominguez has established\nhis global reputation
for deep and expansive\nresearch on Mexico
as well as many other\ncountries of Latin America.
He's the Antonio\nMadero professor
for the study of Mexico,\nworks in the Department
of Government, and\nhas produced work
that is impacting\nMexico and generations
of students who work on\nthat country and elsewhere.
I mean, he has a\nwhole tier of students
that have continued to push\nforward studies of Mexico.
Jorge has played a\nkey role at Harvard
in almost all international\ninitiatives, whether at DRCLAS,
at the Center for\nInternational Studies, as chair
of the Harvard Academy\nfor International Studies,
or, more recently,\nas the Vice Provost
for International Affairs.
So Jorge, we're so pleased that\nyou could be with us tonight
to introduce Mayor Mancera.
Thank you all very much.
It really is a pleasure\nto be with you here
and particularly to be here\nwith the mayor of Mexico City.
I want to first\ntake the opportunity
to reaffirm what my\nfriend Dean Mostafavi
and my colleague and friend\nDiane Davis have done as well,
but to try to do it briefly.
And it is to affirm this\nuniversity's engagement
with Mexico.
The good examples are, as\nProfessor Davis just said,
she has spent her\nprofessional career
studying the city of Mexico\nand seeking to understand that
in the context of other issues.
The last time I had the\npleasure and the opportunity
to spend several consecutive\ndays with the dean
was, in fact, about a\nyear ago in Mexico City.
The Graduate School of Design\ntakes Mexico seriously,
as does Harvard as well.
It's worth remembering\nthat the David Rockefeller
Center for Latin\nAmerican studies
has an office in\nMexico City that
seeks to support the faculty and\nthe students who work there--
including a number\nof my colleagues
who are here in the\nroom this evening.
It's also worth\nmentioning, in the context
of the experience of the United\nStates of the last few months,
one small fact.
25 years ago, the number of\nMexican students at Harvard
was 39.
2006, a year I\nremember because it
was the year I became\nuniversity Vice Provost,
the number had gone up to 78.
And their most\nrecent number is 124.
When I was Vice Provost but\nalso over the last few months,
I am often asked the\nquestion, how many Mexicans
should Harvard University have?
My answer in the past,\nas in recent months,
has always been the same.
I have no idea of what\nthat number might be,
but I do know the right answer.
The right answer is a four\nletter word, more, more.
This university has\nthrived and benefited
by engaging with Mexico and\nwith the people of Mexico,
and this is very\nmuch a commitment
that we expect to continue.
It's not just that\nwe hope to continue.
It's that we expect to continue.
And though I am no longer\nuniversity Vice Provost,
I am confident\nthat on this issue
I speak for the president, the\nProvost, and the corporation.
It really is an honor as well to\nsalute Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, not
only the first\ndemocratically elected mayor
of the city of Mexico\nbut a key architect
of Mexico's democratization.
He has been to\nHarvard before, but it
is particularly wonderful\nto have him here
this evening as the first\ndemocratically elected mayor
and the most recent\ndemocratically elected mayor
Dr. Miguel Angel Mancera.
Dr. Mancera has had a\ndistinguished career, in part,
as an academic, as a\nprofessor, as an author
in a variety of Mexico's\nleading universities.
He has been engaged as well in\npublic service, in particular,
in the city of Mexico, where he\nserved with great distinction
as attorney general of\nthe city for four years
before becoming mayor\nof the city in 2012.
One way to describe\nhis work is not just
with particular examples, but\nwe should remind each other,
as I am sure the mayor will\npoint out in his remarks,
that this is a gigantic city.
And it is the city, as\nit has evolved over time,
with extraordinary challenges--
challenges that are difficult\nfor any mayor to address.
He has addressed them\nvery effectively.
Whenever I have been\nin Mexico City--
living in the city as I did a\nyear ago for some months and I
have at other times--
I have been impressed not\nonly with the experience,
the pleasures, of\nliving in the city
and those whom I meet\nand engage but also
over time with the numerous\ncircumstances where the mayor's
effective leadership has been\na significant factor in making
Mexico City better, more\neffective, more livable, more
successful.
And that is why we are\ncelebrating his visit,
honoring his presence,\nand giving him the podium.
Good afternoon, good afternoon\nto all, and each one of you,
all of you, and\nladies and gentlemen.
First of all, I'd like to\nthank Harvard this opportunity
the University of\nHarvard, for me,
is very exciting to listen the\ndirectors and the professors,
the opinion they have of Mexico,\nMexicans, and, of course,
the great opportunities that\nwe have exchange of ideas.
I want to thank also\nProfessor Mohsen because
of his connections.
And now, Jorge Dominguez,\nthank you so much.
Thank you for what you\nthink of the city of Mexico
and what you think of Mexico.
I'm very glad that at the\nauditorium we have so many
distinguished guests,\nlike Sergio Aguayo,
like Antonio Azuela, like\nMiguel [INAUDIBLE] from which I
greeted a few minutes ago--
Dr. Perlo.
Important people\nthat I have helped
and a lot of investigators\nthat have helped us
on many of the political\ntasks and also scientific
in the city of Mexico.
I have the privilege\nand the honor
that they are working with us--
the engineer Walter [INAUDIBLE].
He's an important figure\nlike they said here,
of the democratic part\nof the city of Mexico,
and the task that they\nachieved in the city of Mexico.
For the first time,\nthe city of Mexico
has a political\nconstitution that
gives the city the\nquality that we'll
talk about later further ahead.
I'll talk to you\nfast, the way we're
living in the city of Mexico,\nand what's the context,
and how are city is, and some\namounts that are important.
I would say that\nfor the government
of the city of Mexico the\ntheme of climatic change
is a very serious point.
It's a theme that worries\nus, it compromises us,
it compromises the city,\nand the future of the city,
and the future of our children.
We are working\nevery day to better
the relationship\nand obviously what's
going to happen in the future.
In the city of Mexico we\nhave 1,500 square kilometers.
The territory is not very\nbig, but, however, we
have officially 8.8 residents.
But, in reality, we give\nservice approximately 16 or 17
million citizens at the\npeak hour around noontime
and further on.
And all of these\npeople they go back
after they have demanded\nservices, security services,
water services, et cetera.
In the metropolitan zone\nin the city of Mexico,
daily, 5.3 million\nvehicles move around,
and they consume approximately\n3,489 million gallons of fuel.
58% of this amount we\nutilize for transportation,
26% for the industry, and\n13% for the consumers,
and 3% for the commerce.
We have a metro subway\nin the city of Mexico
that transports daily more\nthan 5 million people.
225 kilometers of subway\nin the city of Mexico
that has to be tended,\nhas to be reactivated,
and we have to make\nsure that it functions
in a space of three hours from\nthe moment that we disconnect
and then the moment\nthat it reconnects
to give service the next day.
The city of Mexico has\ntaken this compromise
to fight the climatic\nchange since 2014.
Well, in reality,\nlike 30 years ago,
was the most contaminated\ncity in the world.
The government have been\nworking constantly and taking
measures that have cost too much\nmoney, but we did it that way.
But they are indispensable\nto change this classification
as being the city most\ncontaminated in the world,
depending on the gases\nand contamination.
This, honestly, has\nbeen a big task.
In the government,\nsince 2014, we
started work with\na climatic program.
We come from 2014 to\n2020, and in this plan,
the following administration\nwill have two years
to evaluate results and\nredesign the program
with a new objective.
This program of\na climatic action
has two tasks-- the\nfirst one to mitigate
10 million tons\naccumulated in 2020,
and this is 40% more\nambitious than what we wanted
to do in the prior program.
And the second one is to\nreduce the vulnerability
of 5.6 residents\nthat are exposed
to the impact of climate\nchange in our city.
For them, this program\nof climatic action,
has 102 actions with\nseven strategic points.
Each one of those\nactions one are
going through a system in which\nwe depend on the government,
and they report each project.
Actually, we have 52% right\nnow at mitigation goal.
The vision, this is a\ntrans-personal element
given that we are convinced\nthat the climatic change affects
men and women.
We have identified 78 actions\nin this program focusing
on reducing vulnerabilities.
And with the support of the\nagency, the German Agency, Giz,
we have developed\nspecial indicators
to measure the real impact that\nwe are developing right now.
The city of Mexico is an active\npart of the initiative C40
to help the next\ngeneration in the fight
against the climatic change.
In this task, the city of\nMexico has taken very seriously
part of the technology.
We are one of the first\ncities that we are
measuring the carbon dioxide.
We monitor the\nmetropolitan point,
and we have applications\nwith phones.
We realize there's 95% of\nmonitoring stations in the city
that belong to the city\neven though they are
in the metropolitan\nzone, and now we've
launched the possibility to\nanticipate a contingency--
anticipate 24 hours prior.
And the city will be in an\nenvironmental contingency.
I want to tell you fast how\nthe Mexico City passed measure
in the contingencies.
Mexico City, in the '90s,\nhad practically 400 points
of contamination.
From the 400 points\nof contamination,
in the period of\nthe year 2000, we
went to have 280, 285\npoints of contamination.
We receive the administration\nwith 185 to 210, more or less.
Today, in the American\nunion, we have
cities that they have\npre-contingencies.
And once they get to this\nlevel we have alerts,
and then they get\ninto contingencies.
In the city of Mexico,\nthey retired this.
[INAUDIBLE] is because the\nfederal government establishes
this, the city,\nthey have to adjust.
In the last adjustment\nthey did they passed us
from 185 to 150 points\nof contamination.
It was a reduction of 30 points\nthat we had to do from one day
to the other.
We didn't have any\nprevious notice.
We just had a new measurement\nas if we created a new form
to quantify this.
If you weighed 80 kilograms\nyou were going to go in weight,
and then we had to adapt.
Fortunately, up\nuntil now, we have
been able to face\nup until moment,
we can say that we are in line.
We don't have pre-contingencies.
We go immediately to\nthe contingencies.
This places us in a\nsituation of challenges
of a higher challenge and\nalso at larger advantage.
That's why when you\nsee Mexico, when
you see this amount of vehicles,\nthe amount of residents,
the city of Mexico is not\nthe most contaminated city
in Mexico.
We are between 7th and\n8th place in cities
of contamination because\nof a series of measurements
that we've taken.
Let's say that our city\nannually is creating
20.6 tons of carbon dioxide.
And then the metropolitan\nzone, like the big city
in the city of Mexico, let's\nsay that it encompasses
all the municipalities\nin the city of Mexico,
they emit 56.1 million\ntons of contaminants.
How do we know this?
This is very important\nbecause we have an inventory
of gases contaminations.
We have an inventory\nof emissions.
We are the first city to\ncomply with this inventory
of emissions.
Once they demanded this\nto us, we presented this.
This means that\nevery two years we
are working on this inventory.
The inventory from\n2014 was recognized
for the [? pack ?] of\nmayors, like I mentioned,
and we had 95% together with\nthe city of Paris and Vancouver.
This inventory indicates that\nsector of the city of Mexico,
this is what contributes\nmost to the emissions,
61% of carbon dioxide and\n1,793 of black carbon.
It's a compound\nduring the winter.
It deteriorates\nthe quality of air
and the health of\nthe population.
That's why, in this\nadministration,
we are working very\nhard to transform
the mobility of the city.
We go from a design\nof integral transport,
and we focus on the residence\nand not on the vehicles.
It's not easy, but\ntoday we are doing it
in a way that is consistent.
So what is this about?
We give priority to\nthe system, VRP--
like I said, in the system in\nthe morning and the afternoon.
I want to know what time\nit is right now where
we are, but the Boston mayor--
we're going to talk about\na little bit of this.
We are giving priority to\nthis matter of mobility
and focusing on individuals\nand not on vehicles.
This matter, VRT in\nthe city of Mexico,
has taken us to build\neach time more lines.
Because when we build a\nVRT in the city of Mexico,
people get good news.
We make an intervention\nfrom street to street.
We may get an intervention\nwhich we better
all of the urban areas.
Also, the vegetation has a\nvery important participation,
and in which the buses go\nfrom four to one regarding all
the types of transportation.
The difference between the\nVRT in the city of Mexico
with other systems that we\nhave observed in the country
is that we retire all the\nvehicles that get old.
If we place VRT--
that's the only\ntransportation we have there
that circulates in that zone.
Now we are working in the\nconstruction of line number
seven.
The Reforma-- the people\nthat know this area know what
I'm talking about--
is a very important reach\nat more than 15 kilometers.
And, at the same time, we\nare building line number five
in these conditions as well\nto better transportation.
And we have buses with the\nlatest technology, two hybrids,
and also, in some\ncases, in natural gas.
This is the change\nthat we're planning.
One other thing we did\nin the city of Mexico
was through the\n[INAUDIBLE] to prohibit
that they keep giving\nout concessions
to taxis that are no electric\ntaxis, or electric cars,
or hybrid taxis.
With this, we are\ncontributing to mitigating
various tons of carbon\ndioxide, and also, it
benefits the mobility of the\ncity of Mexico and the users.
With this, the life of the\ntaxis, so the vehicles,
would be like 10 years.
Every 10 years\nwe'll be renovating
the flotilla of these vehicles\nbetween 120,000 and 125,000
taxis.
That's why it was\nreally important for us.
Like any other huge city\nof urban development,
our city impacts the\ngeneration of waste.
What I'm going to\ncomment about right
now is what we generate\nin the city of Mexico
when it comes to waste.
Most people don't believe\n12 and 1/2 tons of trash day
by day-- more than 12,000\ntons of trash a day.
They used to take the trash\nto all these different places.
We have a place that\nwe have intervened
in which we have millions of\ntons of trash in landfills,
and they generate\ngas and energy.
But in this administration,\nwe'll launch a program.
It's called Trash Zero,\nand this administration--
because actually we're working\nwith 6,000 tons of trash.
We are working with compost\nand transformation of the same
trash, which it takes us to--\nbecause of the numbers that
the city produces, this\n6,000 tons of trash daily--
we're taking the trash\nfrom Leon, Tijuana,
or any huge city in\nour country completely.
However, we are at 50%.
Today, we are practically at\nthe last steps of a program
that we've been taking care\nof with many organizations
with ONG, the environment,\nto have a plant--
one of the biggest plants,\none of the most modern plants
in the world of\nthermal valorization.
This will be two plants\nthat, together, they
will be processing\n5,000 tons of trash
or refuse daily more\nor less, and this
will permit us to finish\nwith this matter, this theme
of the trash, because we\ndon't want to give this trash.
And also the trash has a\npolitical impression as well.
That's why we have this\nproject Trash Zero that you'll
be listening to\nwith more frequency
because it is advancing\nfast, and this
will be an example for\nall of Latin America.
And, on the other side,\non July 8 of this year,
we are going to establish the\nnew norm of the environment,
Norm C24, technical\nspecifications in which we
will do a separation of trash.
We are looking to increase a\ncultural environment, not only
technology but also structuring\nactions of technology.
Also, we are looking\nto educate the society,
to educate the\npopulation, and that's
why in the separation of trash\neach time we work even harder.
But if we don't push this,\nthis will never happen.
The situation will be the same.
That's why we're\nworking with this.
This is a norm, and this will\nbe, obviously, obligatory
to do it this way.
One more action that has\nto do with hospitals.
Even if you don't believe it,\nand I didn't believe it either,
but our hospitals, some of\nthem were working with diesel.
The furnaces were\nworking with diesel.
We have a compromise with Paris\nto finish the use of diesel
in the city of Mexico.
One of the obstacles is with the\npublic transportation and also
our heaters.
We have 32 hospitals\nin the city of Mexico,
and the 32 hospitals\nthey are trying
to work with clean\nenergy in the treatment
of the furnaces, the heaters.
And also we took this norm\nthat will be a pioneer system.
We're going to work also\nwith the matter of the jails.
Everything that has to do\nwith furnaces and heaters,
everything that has\nto do with energy,
we are transforming this\nin the city of Mexico
towards renewable energy.
This is the first city\nthat has a contract
to provide just the metro\npart of the city of Mexico
what they waste--
the city of Mexico,\n225 kilometers--
we could light up a whole\ncity in our territory.
That's why we are connecting\nnow to have energy, oil
energy, and hydraulic energy.
In 2014, with the support\nof the International
Agency for Developing in the\nUS, we started this program.
I'm sure you can recognize this.
This program, we are developing\nthis project in the hospitals
of the city of Mexico\nand also the one
that we're going to\nachieve this reduction--
very important.
Also, one more part\nof this initiative
will be with the\nUnited Nations, which
is like sustainable energy\nbetter known as the SEforALL.
It has more than 1,400\nbusiness leaders,
and we are implementing a pilot\nproject on energy efficiency.
With WEIR, we are\nstarting the second phase
of building to develop\nsomething called the retrofit--
like illumination.
All of the building we are\nbuilding are very modern,
and they're following the\nclassification [? LIT. ?]
All of the buildings will\ngive us a substantial benefit
in the homes that we are--
the construction rules\nin the city of Mexico,
they have to follow the\nnorms of the city of Mexico.
Houses for more than\n100 square meters,
they have to install\nsolar heating systems--
and also establishing\nindustrial sites
like offices 35% on top of the\nbenefits for the environment.
We also have a compromise in\nthe searching of solutions
that will also help\nus to mitigate,
but also we're going to better\nthe infrastructure of the city.
We need a citizenship\nthat understands,
that worries about, to combat,\nto fight the climate change.
If you would ask me how was the\nwinter in the city of Mexico?
I will tell you we\ndidn't have a winter.
We didn't have a moment\nin which we had cold.
And now we are in Boston,\nand this afternoon
of, like, winter and spring--
this theme of climatic change--
I believe that all of\nus will live in this.
I really don't know when\nwe're going to get snow.
At any moment, it could happen.
That's why we are taking\nthese actions of education
and communication to\nhelp the citizenship
to have strategic planning.
And we have some\nactions that we do
in a consistent way like, for\ninstance, the Barter Market.
It's an initiative that\nwe started four years ago.
You can see that right there.
It's not a Walmart.
This is something that\nwe set up in Chapultepec,
in the city of Mexico.
And then we do it\nprecisely, so they
can separate all the\nwaste to be taken
to all these different centers.
And they take this\nto their homes.
There are a few advantages.
These are local products, and\nit generates a lot of empathy.
As you can see right there\nthey have a little children,
and the kids, that are\ntaking their parents,
are the ones that are waiting\nfor the barter market.
So what is this about?
They are more\ninformed than we are.
That's exactly\nwhat we're looking
for with this type of action.
But it's functioning.
It's working really\nwell like everything
that happens in the city\nof Mexico in a huge way.
This is just a small part.
All of the tables they have to\ninstall in this type of action.
We also are pushing the\nseparation of electronic trash.
It's a system of recycling\nwhere we take and receive
electronic elements,\nelectronic instruments,
so people don't throw them out.
So these things\nwon't contaminate.
We have installed 400 columns\nof collections of batteries--
376 tons of used batteries\nthat we have recuperated,
and we have 72 schools that\nform a part of this program.
And when it comes to mobility\nin the city of Mexico,
we were going to\nannounce in the morning--
at the School of Law we're\ntalking about these actions.
It's called ECOBICI\nin the city of Mexico.
It's a program in\nwhich this is a Sunday
and people are participating\nin a very active way.
This is called the\nPastel de Reforma.
In totality, we have more\nthan 250,000 participants.
In a very consistent\nway, I would
say between 50,000 and 60,000.
And we have places of gathering\nwhere we these actions
are very important.
We have a program--
this is a school.
This has given us huge results\nstarting with the children,
with the kids, what\nyou see right now.
It's a busy parking in\nwhich the city of Mexico
is building the third\none in which they
have thousands of users of\nthese busy parking places.
They have given\nus great results.
They are located at\nthe metro stations
in which they could transfer\nin a very, very efficient way.
In truth, with our\nsystem of bicycles
we are reaching a very\nimportant potential.
We have 65,000 bikes.
We are below New\nYork, but we are
competing with New York\nwith the number of bicycles
in the area, number of bicycle\nstations, with the advantage
that in the city of\nMexico they use it more
for work and for mobility.
And these places, let's\nsay, like the fourth system
at rural level, in\nthe use of bicycles,
approximately, we are going\nto widen this program,
and also bring electrical\nbicycles in which we
have a traffic jam.
That is very important.
This will improve this\npart of the strategy.
Resilience, they didn't\nunderstand it well in the city.
People didn't know that the city\nof Mexico, we are a living lab.
We have the possibility of\nfloods just like Buenos Aires.
I was just there with\na colleague of mine
regarding this\nflood issue, but we
have the possibility also of\nan earthquake like in Chile
or anywhere in America.
We also have the possibility\nof very, very hard winds.
More than 70 trees were\njust taken from the root.
All of these things, in\nthe concept of resilience,
you can do all the\nstudies you want.
That's why we work with\nthe Rockefeller Foundation.
We are one of the 30\nprincipal cities that
formed part of the strategy.
Of 100 cities, the\ncompromise that we have
is based on strategic\nthemes to build resiliency.
Basically, that it has to\ndo with the coordination
of regions, the construction of\nresilience, water resilience.
And also, as a matter of fact,\nwhen I got to this building,
I was talking to the water needs\nthat the city of Mexico has.
The city of Mexico,\nwe were an island,
and we tried to get\nall the water out.
And then we took the water\nout, so we could have streets.
And now we're thinking\nabout how are we
going to get the water back.
It keeps being like a lagoon.
And then when it rains, if we\ndon't have a drainage system,
we have a very\nimportant complication.
13,000 kilometers of water and\n12,000 kilometers of drainage,
and so basically we\nhave 25,000 kilometers
to tend to every single\nday with the water system
in the city of Mexico.
That's why this matter\nof the resiliency
is indispensable to our city.
Today, we have\nthis task that has
to do with what I talked to you\nabout with the climatic change.
With the rains in\nthe city of Mexico,
a year ago, we would say\nwe could have initial rain,
but first, we have floods.
So now we have so much of\nthe city that is flooded.
In the past, we would say\nwe have unusual showers.
Now they're more usual.
In truth, I really don't know\nwhich one is usual or unusual.
Now we have thunderstorms.
Well, the city of Mexico\nhas a conservation platform.
Some people would say, is\nthis in the city of Mexico?
Yes, that's part that\nwe're going to recoup,
in which we have\neffective interventions.
It's a city that has\n60% of conservation
that sadly we didn't\nplan, and we allowed--
that most of these\nareas were invaded--
that now we are in a\nprocess of recuperating,
we have more than 600 hectares\nof zones that were invaded.
If we don't take care\nof this, this zone
will be invaded\nby the whole city.
And now we are giving strength\nto environmental services.
So, in other words, we have to\npay the people that live there,
so they can take care of\nand also improve this area
to conserve it in their\nplan of resiliency.
Basically, this is\nsouth of the city.
This is the objective,\nto recuperate the system,
to avoid these impacts that\nare created by climatic change.
We're working on drainage\nsystems and also storing water.
All of these are\nthousands of thousands
of dollars or\nmillions of dollars
to be able to do these actions.
We can do it in a simple way.
To be able to deal with\nthis climatic change
we're looking at diverse\nforms of financing also
with Michael Bloomberg.
And we have a period, he would\nsay, why don't you just request
this funding, the green funds.
The only green thing that\nI know is like the grass
because the green\nfunds don't exist.
Where are these green funds--
their place in the government?
We have to change his focus.
So the financial\ninstitutions need
to support more\nlocal governments,
so we can implement this task.
And this doesn't go to the local\ngovernment in the strategies
that we need to be able\nto face the situation.
So then you have to go\nlook for the financing,
but when you want\nthese projects you
have to go through\nthe federal government
to go through a bank to be\nable to work on the resources.
To get to our objective\nregarding resiliency
we are talking\nabout $7.2 billion.
If you transferred this from now\nto 70 years from now, probably,
this amount, it\nwill be enormous.
That's why it is\nimportant, so we could
have a new way of financing.
The government of the city\nhas launched a few strategies.
Today, we have a fund\nfor climatic change.
In 2016, it was\n5.8 million pesos.
And the city of Mexico, today,\nhas the first green fund.
It passed last December 7.
You can see this.
Last December 7, our\ncity was converted,
and the first city\nof Latin America
to admit a green bond\nin the stock exchange.
This will be only focusing--
we achieved this with the\nMexican stock exchange.
So this year we compromised\nourselves to bring more reach
to this amount.
Instead of a billion, we\nwant to get to 1.5 billion,
or I would say $80 billion.
I don't know how\nthe change goes.
Let's hope that the change\nwon't be that aggressive.
$75 million invested in this\nproject of the green bonds--
we are very pleased\nthat the city of Mexico
was recognized with\nthis instrument
because, specifically, for\nour program of climatic action
up until 2020 to be able to\nmitigate this 10 million tons.
That's why I would say\nnow, with the Constitution,
this is the first constitution\nthat is doing some publicity.
Because the first constitution\nin the city of Mexico,
within itself, some of\nthese tasks in other times,
it would have been\nvery difficult to do.
With Article 16, it talks about\nthe territoriality ordinance.
It talks about, exclusively,\nto the environment.
I want to explain to you why\nwe require this biodiversity,
and how we have to minimize\nthe ecological change.
It talks about\nenvironmental services,
and everything that\nI talked to you about
is within this article.
It has a specific part of\nvulnerability and mitigation
of risk, and it\nhas a specific part
of the care of the environment\nfor the mayor's office.
It's a transversal obligation\nin the whole constitution--
the environment.
This is one of the most modern\nsystems in Latin America.
They come from the Academy.
They come from\nmany of the studies
that they are doing right now.
I believe that now,\nour governments, we
have an obligation\nnot to ignore--
regarding this fight with\nthe climatic change--
some people say, well, that's\njust in your imagination.
This is something\nthat we made up.
We are convinced that the\nclimatic change, it does
exist indeed, and we\nlive in the consequences.
When we are faced with nature\nwe see the power of nature.
We see the destructive\npower of nature, destruction
that we have generated\nin ourselves.
And this is important that\nwe place everything, all
our resources,\ntechnology, knowledge,
innovation, to the service\nof the environment.
We can talk about many\nof the political issues.
We can talk about the task.
We can plant many, many actions.
Today, we can still do it.
We can sit down and\ndiscuss this at Harvard
regarding climatic change.
We can read books.
We can do some urban planning.
We can do some financial\ncalculations to give
sustainability to the cities.
But the moment in which\nwe don't take care of this
then we are going\nto have nothing.
We're going to end up without\na planet, without cities,
we are going to end up\nwith nothing-- nothing
to take care of.
There's nothing else\nto say afterwards.
The city of Mexico\nhas this compromise.
It's a small territory\nof our country,
but this a city that\nhas a demand of services
and this participation in\nthe task of climate change.
That's why we're very\nglad that we can present
this task, indeed, with a lot of\nsatisfaction to be able to talk
to you about it here\nat Harvard, so we
can try to find more\nsolutions to the ones we have.
Again, I want to thank\nthis prestigious university
for the opportunity, the\nteachers that are helping us,
and also the shared strategies\nin which, here, Harvard, we're
talking about the environment\nand also the health in which we
are doing a transversal line\nregarding a mobility health
environment the\ngovernment finances
and absolutely all of\nthe areas of planning,
so we can get to this objective.
I didn't know that\nall that work that we
do that will be\nindispensable to be
able to fight climate change.
And the city of Mexico is\ncompromised to work with it,
and I'm very happy\nthat I could come here
in this winter\nafternoon with you
at such a prestigious\nuniversity at Harvard.
Thank you very much.
Good afternoon.
Good evening.
Thank you so much.
Dr. Mancera, for this\ndetailed information,
our purpose is to\nstart briefly and also
to open the possibility that\nyou can formulate questions.
Listening to your position from\nthe beginning of your talk,
we have the theme of\npublic transportation.
And one doubt is how the\ngovernment of the city--
how are they organized\nto decide which
are the projects of intervention\nin public transportation
that they have to establish.
What priorities do\nthey have to establish?
There's a lot of demand,\nbut we can't do everything
all at once.
How are we going to\ndetermine the financing?
What is interesting to me\nis to understand exactly
how the government,\nhow is the mayor
going to organize to help\ndecide projects, priorities,
and financing?
From the huge budget\nin the city of Mexico
that is approximately\n170 million--
let me do the\nconversion in dollars.
It would be 170 million pesos.
From there, you have\nhuge different amounts
for $10 billion\nfor each project.
This $10 billion, we have\nto take the whole amount
for the whole city.
Michael Bloomberg, I talked\nto him about this budget,
and he said, well, how\ncome the city of Mexico
has such a small budget.
So then you have\nto decide each one,
you know, where are you\ngoing to allocate that money?
We have a public transportation\nthat is within the city.
This is approximately 600\nbuses, and then with these buses
we are renovating in\nwhich we compromised
to renovate the system.
At the end, the government will\nhave only the latest generation
buses.
This is a compromise\nregarding the budget.
Then we have the\nmetro, the subway.
In the metro, the\nsubway, the investments
are multibillion dollar\ninvestments because Mexico,
regarding the transfers\nof technology,
we are beginning to start.
Now we'll be\nmanufacturing trains,
but we have to keep buying them.
We have to buy trains from\nFrance, Spain, and China.
This implies a large expense\nto be able to do this project.
For instance, the metro,\nthe subway, we need also,
the federal government\nhas to participate.
In this exercise, we have\ncanceled, more or less,
three projects because we\ndon't have the means because
of all the cutbacks.
This affects the city\nof Mexico in a huge way
because we should have\nclosed this government
from 225 to 250 kilometers.
Practically, we had to\nclose 260 kilometers,
and we'll be closing 131,\nwhich is a reduction.
If we don't take into account\nthis, we'll get to the point
that we will not be able to do\nthis because the maintenance is
very expensive.
And also, this is\nregarding concessions.
So what did the government do?
They published an\ninstruction, so they
would have only taxis that\nare hybrid and electrical.
We are getting financing.
Taxi drivers understand\nnow that it's
much more economic to have a\nhybrid car even though they're
more expensive, but then they\nhave a larger earning capacity.
And it allows them to work in\na much more comfortable way.
This project will\ntake about 10 years.
The city of Mexico will be\nworking with only these taxis,
hybrid cars and electric cars.
The best thing that\nwe have in this city
is that, a few years\nback, the vans.
We have prohibited\nthe use of vans.
We're not going to have any\nmore microbuses or vans.
How many of these do we require?
We need to eliminate at\nleast 30,000 at this moment.
At this moment, we need to\neliminate around around 13,000
still.
And to substitute, in\nthe case of metro bus,
from four to one regarding\nother transportation from two
to three to one, which\nwill help the city,
and also to generate a\nbetter infrastructure.
So who is going to invest?
The other problem\nis the tariffs.
The tariffs in\nthe city of Mexico
are the lowest\ntariffs in the world--
China also, but, you know,\nmore or less, the same price.
In the city of Mexico,\nit's like 25 pesos,
which is like a quarter--
$25.
And it doesn't allow\nus to get better,
but the government subsidizes.
We are servicing the\nmetropolitan zone.
To millions of people,\nit's a complex topic.
But the focus that\nwe have in this city
is to provide, to give more\nimportance to the pedestrians,
to the transportation\nthat is not authorized,
and substitute to\npublic transportation
to be able to have a better\noption and a better option
when it comes to traveling.
One second question,\nand then I'd
like to invite other people\ntoo, you mentioned just now
in this answer--
the challenges of\ncoordinating the government
and the federal government.
And also, in your\nspeech, you said
that the green funds they go\nto the federal government, not
the government in the city.
In a federal system in\nwhich the city, the capital
of the country where the\nfederal government is located,
where a huge part of the people\nthat utilizes the services.
How, without limiting\nourselves to the topic
to the transportation,\nwhich would
be a good example\nof something that
has functioned rather\nwell in the relationship
between the federal government\nand the government of the city?
Which would be a\ntheme or a topic
that you would say\nit could be better?
Well, this question is not easy.
What has functioned well--
we're talking about mobility?
No, no, we're talking\nabout any topic
regarding your speech,\nyour exposition,
to give you more freedom.
I don't want to tie you up.
I believe honestly\nthat the city of Mexico
they haven't helped\nit the way they
should have-- something\nthat we achieved
in this administration.
Obviously, something that we\ndidn't have because it didn't
exist, was the capital fund.
It's an acknowledgement\nto the city of Mexico,
the capital of the republic,\n70% of all manifestation
or strikes--
75% is for a federal problem.
Every time there's a strike\nin the city of Mexico
they do a great job in\nsecurity and mobility.
And the political\nborder to city is high.
We achieve to have a fund.
We have had a chapter that is\nobligatory in which we can move
because of the deputies,\nthe congressman,
we have in a different part.
And this has allowed us to--
they lowered it to\na couple of million,
and then they keep\nlowering this.
We require to have a law.
It's called a law\nof coordination.
But we this fund.
Let's say that this was a\nvery important achievement.
Something that has\nfunctioned, in my opinion,
is the metro, the subway.
The federal government\nrequires to have someone
that would understand\nthis need, the mobility
in the metropolitan area.
Because the metro, the subway,\ntoday is providing services
to many municipalities.
Moreover, more than five\nor six million people
that use the metro, the\nsubway, in the city of Mexico,
40% of usage is the\nstate of Mexico.
When they get to Mexico they\nspend between 20 and 25 pesos,
and then they get on the subway,\nand it only costs five pesos.
The care, the\nmaintenance, everything's
covered by the city of Mexico.
I believe there is a flaw here.
Now they sent $24 million\nto the train in Toluca,
and, compared to\nthis, that other train
has nothing to do with the\nmetro in the city of Mexico.
Because I don't\nknow, for instance,
if you've been to see Ecatepec.
I'm sure you didn't, but if\nyou go to the city of Mexico,
if you go to [? Bellas ?]\n[? Artes ?] or go to different
places, the cost benefit\nthere in that train is located
at a station.
So that's what is going to\ngive the train, the system,
viability.
Those $24 million, we're talking\nabout, we should have built--
each station, it\ncosts $2 billion.
We are going to invite--
If you have a\nquestion, please just
give your name and a brief\ndescription of who you are.
Let's hear it.
I am Enrique Cifuentes.
I am a Mexican.
I worked at Harvard for\nmore than eight years.
And one of the things\nthat I want to ask
is the transparency,\nthe corruption,
is a theme that goes\nthrough many things--
you know, the environment\nand everything
that you can see in\nMexico, and there's nothing
that we should be ashamed of.
Our country, this\ncountry, is going
through a horrible crisis.
It's not a problem of\njust only Mexico, so what
else do we need to do in Mexico\nto be able to have transparency
and to be able to--
that all the money that is\nspent in the train in Toluca
is used for the city?
I believe that there's\nsomething in the Constitution--
it's called the Institute\nof [? Planification-- ?]
that will allow the\ncitizenship to be
aware of the plans of the city.
I'm sure that at this Institute\nof [? Planification ?]
they talk about\nthe infrastructure.
In one of the articles\nin our constitution
there is this position that 22%\nof the budget from the mayor's
office has to be used\nfor infrastructure.
Today, it's just 1%,\nor you can send 10%.
It's very difficult\nto find something
that gets to the 22% or 30% to\nthe material of infrastructure,
but we have this tendency.
So what is the city of Mexico?
I am convinced that\nthe transparency
is a very effective tool to\ncombat, to fight corruption.
Like the 1313 declarations\nor we're working with OCP.
We have a contract with\nOCP and with Bloomberg
to work with open\ncontracts, so we could have,
in real time, how is the\ncontracts in the government
in the city, and\nso for the citizens
to have an interaction.
Let's say the steps\nthat we've taken--
also, we have created a judicial\nsystem that absolutely protects
us in this way, and\nthen we'll have to,
little by little, it'll\nget purer and purer.
I believe that this\nis in that direction
that it's going in the way we\nare creating this Constitution,
and we'll see the results.
And we're also talking\nto the citizens
as well, so they can get\ninvolved with the government.
And this will be a\ndifferent step that
will take us to a\ndifferent result.
If not, it will never change.
I should have said\nthat you could
ask a question with\nwhatever language
you feel comfortable with.
Yes?
My name is Cynthia [INAUDIBLE].
You said the transportation is\na system that infrastructure
in the environment which would\nbe the theme in which Mexico
has achieved this articulation,\nthis metropolitan change,
within the different\njurisdictions
of the same region.
Well, we have, at\nthis moment, sadly,
we have various metropolitan\nzones in a country.
The biggest\nmetropolitan zone that
has the most residents, that\nwe are reaching more than 25
million people, is where\nwe have the city of Mexico.
We have the city of Mexico,\nthe state of Mexico,
and then we have\nthe state of Hidalco
with so many municipalities.
Now, this, we call it--
it's not a metropolis,\nbut it's megalopolis
because you are including\nother territories
that the city of Mexico\ndid not consider.
We did this because of the\nenvironment in which ways
this works with the agreements\nthat we have because we still
have to prove, at\nthe end, everything
is a political theme.
Like to verify, we have to\nmonitor the different forms
of the environment,\nand also, we have
to set up the public\ntransportation,
and also work on the budget.
This also, it hasn't\nreached this level.
In some cities they\nsay, we don't have
a problem with the environment.
They say the only city\nthat has a problem
is the city of Mexico.
But, up until then, because the\ndecisions that we have to take
are not very popular.
And also, the scientific part,\nwe still have a few glitches.
So I believe in\nMexico, in our zone,
what is allowing us to\nadvance is this part that
has to do with the environment\nbecause we have reached
an agreement that this\nmetropolitan zone, the majority
of the budget in\nthe city of Mexico
because they say that\nthere are more residents.
Well, we have to give Mexico\nmore money in the budget
because they have\nmore residents,
but the city of Mexico\nprovides more services.
But why does the city of Mexico\nhave that many residents?
Because land is more expensive.
So people live outside\nthe city of Mexico,
but they come into\nthe city of Mexico.
So in the formula we haven't\nreached an agreement.
It will be a while\nbecause those formulas,
they move completely\nthe participation
of the federal resources\nand the support.
Tomorrow, Salomon is going\nto explain another topic.
No, the airport in\nthe city of Mexico.
So what's going to\nhappen with the airport
in the city of Mexico\nwhen we build the airport?
We're talking about 300 acres.
What are we going to\ndo with this land?
The International Airport\nin the city of Mexico
will be in the state of Mexico.
The land of the city\nof Mexico, we're
going to use that to finance.
So what are we going to do with\nthose acres, with this land?
This is another\nmetropolitan decision,
and some people are\ntalking about this.
We're talking about\na theme that has
to do with education\nbecause this city is
a city of universities.
We are starting studies.
We want to have a\ngreat experience.
We went to have success like\nother cities in the world.
We know that the\nairports cannot co-exist.
We have to leave one and\nthen build another one.
I don't think that that's\nthe way it should be.
So then, in a metropolitan\nway, which works,
it's called commission\nof the megalopolis.
Hello, good evening.
I am Professor\nSanchez, thank you.
My name is Ramon Sanchez.
I come from the School of\nPublic Health at Harvard,
and I worked here for six years.
My question comes from\nregarding the benefits.
You mentioned the\nenvironmental benefits--
you mentioned 433,000\ntons of carbon dioxide,
376 tons of batteries, 715\ntons of electronic waste,
780 tons of just waste.
And the program of energy\nand the reduction of trash
that you want to reduce\nfrom 12,080 tons a day--
you want to reduce it to 50%.
So my question is the following.
Why are you not mentioning\nthe impact on the health?
You know, the lives\nthat are saved,
lives were saved\nbecause of reduction
of this emission, the\ntoxicity that is reduced when
the batteries are collected--
do we have a program to\nmonitor all these impacts?
Yes, we have a program.
We have a commission.
Like I was saying, the\ncommission of megalopolis.
We have insisted\na lot because when
they passed the measurement from\n200 to 250, the only argument
that we had with the citizens,\nbecause people could not
circulate, the reaction\nwas really violent.
This was a theme\nof public health,
but, however, regarding the\ncommission of megalopolis,
we insisted that the Secretary\nof Health had to be involved.
Today, the Secretary\nof Health is involved.
So what did we do?
We formed a council in\nwhich we have the people
around the university,\nthe Polytechnic Institute,
where we have all these\nhuge important people that
are analyzing the effects and\nthe health of the citizens.
For instance, we used\nto tell the society,
we are taking these measures\nbecause your health is in play.
And then people would say,\nwell, that's not true.
You're making this up.
Today, we have clear data.
We have the Secretary of Health\nof the city of Mexico working,
and the way how it\nhas benefited the city
and how it has impacted the\npeople that are hurt the most
are the children\nunder six years old,
pregnant women, and older\npeople that are healthy that
have respiratory problems.
It affects them the most.
People needed to have\nan authority when
it comes to health because if\nyou say, you know, as the boss,
it seems like it's more\npolitical than anything.
But yes, we have measured.
Dr. [? Aware, ?] in\nall of the reports,
we have presented\nall these results
with the debts,\npeople that are sick,
regarding the climatic changes.
Yeah, we are doing this with a\nproject with the collaboration
of the Harvard School\nof Public Health,
and we are also finding\nexactly what is the impact.
We're doing many\nthings, and briefly, we
are going to publish a report.
Thank you very much.
My name is Ana Villarreal.
I'm a sociologist.
And I was a driver in\na route in Monterrey,
so I'm interested\nregarding the drivers, what
is the relationship\nbetween the bus drivers?
I think this is a very\ncomplex negotiation.
And if you could tell\nme a little bit more
about the subject?
The point of the\ncity of Mexico, I'm
going to talk briefly\nabout the trash.
We want to get to\nlike zero trash.
We have 50% less trash.
We are trying to reach the other\n50% using the other programs.
The law of mobility was key.
What it says is the concessions\nfor public transportation,
we only have to give them if\nthey are a known business.
So we change the concept\nof having a private driver.
If someone wants to have a\ntransportation concession
they can only do it by\ngetting to a partnership
with a business.
Because if they want\nto change a microbus,
or a van, or a small bus,\nso the city tells them
they can only have a hybrid\nbus or an electric bus.
So instead of 150,000 pesos,\nwe're talking about $10,000.
He's going to have\nto spend $500,000.
So that that will\nbe the difference
this person, an\nindependent contractor,
will not be able to\nface this personally,
but he will be able to\ndo it as a business.
So when we place a BRT in any\nof the zones, all of the people
there have to form a society,\nand we take everyone.
So sometimes they\nhave a BRT, but they
continue functioning with\nthe other transportation
because that is not\ncorrect because it doesn't
reduce the contamination.
Our objective in\nthe city of Mexico
is just to create\nthis intervention
to take out all of\nthe old vehicles
because that unit that\ngoes south for recycling
is not recycled.
Last question.
My name is [INAUDIBLE]\nI'm Mexican.
I'd like to know what\nare the concrete actions
that the government\nof the city of Mexico,
or the government of the\ncity [INAUDIBLE] Mexico,
will take to educate the\nresidents to separate
the trash instead of giving\nour trash to people in carts
to give the trash\nto the government.
But each time we are\nwidening the barter system
we are buying, also,\nthe units because this
was another problem.
The garbage trucks that we\nhad, we found garbage trucks
from like 1970.
Could you imagine?
They didn't have any technology\nthat would allow us to--
now we have buses,\ngarbage trucks from 2016
that have separators.
They separate the trash\nin a more efficient way.
People are separating the trash.
We are going to\nreinforce this norm.
It will be obligatory\nto separate the trash.
We will only collect\nthe trash according
to some special calendars.
Thousands of people will\ncontribute and much more
in all the city halls that will\nhave to implement these rules.
I calculate, in around\na couple of years
after we implement\nthis norm, this law,
will be much more effective\nlike I said before.
The new house in\nthe new generations
in the city of Mexico, they\nare growing with this theme,
with this topic, you\nknow, solar energy.
And the kids are helping in the\nchange in the way of thinking--
in the way that they will\nmake us, adults, change.
Thank you so much\nfor everything.
Thank you so much for\nanswering all these questions,
and thank you so much for your\nleadership and for your time.
Thank you,\nprofessor-- very kind.
