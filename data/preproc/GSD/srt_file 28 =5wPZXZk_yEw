Good evening.
Good evening, everyone.
Thanks for coming\nout on a night that's
precariously close to\nthe end of the semester.
But no surprise to see a\ngreat turnout this evening.
On behalf of Anita\nBerrizbeitia, and the Dean,
and the Department of\nLandscape Architecture,
it's my true pleasure to\nwelcome you to tonight's lecture
by our dear friend,\nKathryn Gustafson.
Always great to have you here.
In the last few\ndays, anticipating
Kathryn's appearance\nhere at GSD,
I've been thinking about\nthe feeling of real joy
and intrigue in witnessing the\nemergence of Kathryn's practice
in the 1990s, when she was\nworking primarily in Europe.
This was in the aftermath of\nthe la Villette competition
in Paris, when it\nseemed, for a while,
that the programmatic ordering\nand rhetorical posturing
of Bernard Tschumi\nand Rem Koolhaas
could even dominate landscape\narchitecture discourse
for a good amount of time.
Turns out, it did do that.
And that trajectory produced\na useful and productive
conversation about the\nhorizontal surface of the city
as landscape infrastructure.
And that trajectory\nis well known to us.
And we really had\nfew design heroes,
few people to\nemulate in landscape
architecture in that period.
It was a dry period, I think.
It was for me anyway.
Dan Kiley, we had.
I had great teachers here,\nPeter Walker and Laurie Olin.
We had Michel [? Kordju, ?]\none of your teachers.
[? Alexonne ?]\n[? Schemitov, ?] another.
And a handful of\nothers, but not many.
It was as if we were in search\nof voices reflecting a deeper
engagement with the essential\nqualities of landscapes.
Kathryn's work came forward\nfrom a very different place
from all of that conversation.
And, for me, her firm's\nwork helped give voice
to more essential\ntraditions and sources
for landscape architecture.
Without recourse to\narchitectural polemics,
or picturesque\nnostalgia, it seemed
that the sources\nof her work were
neither rhetorical\nnor polemical.
They were rooted in the sensual,\nthe earth bound, the vegetal,
the visceral, the\nexperimental, the experiential,
and the personal, the experience\nof the body and space.
Layered compositions\nthat seemed to be
born of other references,\nother experiences of Kathryn's
love for fashion, a\ndeep knowledge of fabric
and sculpted form,\nand, importantly,
her devotion to the garden.
We were seeing\nvery studied shapes
that seemed to derive\nfrom a love of earthwork.
Forms we hadn't seen, even,\napplied to commissions
that were not easy to build.
By the time the projects for the\nShell Oil Company and the Diana
Memorial had come,\nthe world had really
taken notice of this practice.
And the Lurie\nGarden in the States
became an iconic\ntouchstone just after that.
Here in Boston, the Museum\nof Fine Arts Evans Wing
and the North End\nparks raised the ante,
which hasn't been high\nenough here in Boston
for the public realm.
As the commissions have become\nlarger and far more complex
than the early work, essential\nand layered qualities
in the work have remained,\nand even intensified.
The more recent projects in\nValencia, Singapore, and the US
continue to be consistently\ninspired, beguiling,
and original.
Of particular note,\nand broadly acclaimed,
is the recently opened\nand truly remarkable
work of the National Museum\nof African-American History
and Culture in Washington with\nDavid Adjaye and Phil Freelon.
Looking forward to hearing\nmore about Kathryn's
current preoccupations\nthis evening.
Some of us know what\nit's like to build a firm
and keep it thriving\nfor a long time.
It's gratifying and rewarding.
But it's also complicated\nand challenging.
Uniquely, Kathryn is the\nfounding partner and principal
designer of two firms, Gustafson\nPorter + Bohman in London
and Gustafson Guthrie\nNicol in Seattle.
When she made the decision\nto return to the States
to be closer to her\nfamily in Seattle
now, maybe 20 years\nago, she joined forces
with the brilliant Jennifer\nGuthrie and Shannon Nicol
to build GGN.
A great move, something\nwe've all benefited from.
Kathryn is an honorary\nfellow of the Royal British
Institute of Architects, a\nmedalist of the French Academy
of Architecture, fellow of the\nAmerican Society of Landscape
Architects, one of the two,\nI think, landscape architect
recipients of the Brunner\nPrize, the Obayashi Prize,
the ASLA Design Medal--
very hard to get that--
the Chrysler Design Award,\nLondon's Jane Drew Prize.
The list goes on.
In 2011, Kathryn and\nher partners at GGN
received the Smithsonian's\nCooper Hewitt National Design
Award for landscape\narchitecture,
another very coveted accolade.
All these aside, I'm aware\nthat Katherine finds a way
to spend a lot of her mornings\nand some long days reading
about plants and\ntending to her garden
on one of those amazing\nislands in the San Juans.
I like to think the real prize\nfor her as a designer is just
that, living in the garden.
Please join me in a warm\nwelcome for Kathryn Gustafson.
[APPLAUSE]
Influences.
So, I've sort of put\nthis lecture together.
It's sort of a pre-lecture.
It's something I've been\nworking on for a while of,
why do we do what we do?
And how do you, especially\nbecause you're students,
or some of you\nare professionals,
is, why does a design happen?
Where does it come from?
Where does it come from?
And to also help you\nkind of pay attention
to where things\ncome from for you.
And I have this thing\nthat I call SLAT.
And I actually have it\ntattooed on my wrist.
And I call it stop,\nlook, and think.
Stop, listen, and think.
Stop, learn, and allow time.
And really, how does\nlandscape feel and why?
In the end, you and I\nare creating a place
for human beings to be in.
And we have to understand\nhow that feels.
And that takes time.
It's not this,\nlike, one off idea.
Oh.
I'll do that.
No.
I mean, it's a real\ncomplicated process.
I love what Georgia\nO'Keeffe said.
Make your unknown known.
Every individual is\ndifferent and we're
different because\nof our influences.
So this is where I came\nfrom, a high plateau
desert, Yakima, Washington.
And you'll notice, if I can\nget the pointer to work,
that all these soft tones,\nbecause we have no rain,
is mountains that do\ndams and irrigation.
But as soon as you add water,\nyou have this bright green.
So it's a little bit\nlike Campbell's Soup.
Just add water.
And it means that I was\nraised in this place
with these naked mountains.
And I've always felt like\nEarth is organic, like we are.
And those curves\nare like our curves.
They're liquid.
They're not like rock.
OK?
So we're made of liquids.
And at the base of these,\nwhat you see is the--
excuse me.
Am I going to get this wrong?
Yep.
OK, I'm going to\nget used to this.
At the base of this,\nthis is apples.
And everything is\ndone by irrigation,
so everybody says, why do\nyou do water everywhere?
I was born in a\nplace with no water.
And every piece of water\nwas absolutely precious.
And so you can see what\nI call the water line.
As soon as it's not irrigated,\nit's gravelly plain.
And water is not\na natural thing.
It's a conducted thing.
It's a precious thing\nthat moves through.
And this is what it creates.
This huge abundance\nof fruit, hops, beer.
So this is where I was raised.
And then I ended up going\nhere, to Versailles,
which is where I did\nmy master's degree.
Where everything is constructed.
Where all the water\nis constructed.
Everything has a form,\nhas a definition.
And this is where I learned\nabout monumentality.
These are the 100 Steps.
And they're my most\nfavorite steps in the world,
because you're going\nup to a horizon.
It's like climbing\na mountain, but it's
a human cultural mountain.
You want to get to the top to\nsee what you find at the top.
So that's an\nexperiential, all right?
It's like, I've got to go there.
I've got to see\nwhat's at the top.
And nothing's telling\nyou what's at the top,
except there's a few\ntrees that there might
be another existence up there.
So understanding how\na landscape feels.
This is another huge influence.
This is a man named\nJacques [? Sgard. ?]
And I went to this\npark, Parc de Vincennes,
when I was trying\nto make the decision
to leave fashion design\nfor landscape architecture.
And these are sculpture\nforms he did late '60s.
And I actually stood\non this hillside.
Look at the steepness of that.
And said, I got to do this.
If you can make this\nthing sculptural art,
the unusual experience?
I mean, look at this kid.
Look at the angle of that.
Everything is designed.
It's intentional.
The experience is intentional.
And it just made me fall\nin love with the idea
of doing this profession.
Then there's obviously\nNoguchi, who said, hey,
you can do art and landscape.
And you can make it just\nlike, this most amazing thing.
And then there's\nDennis Oppenheim.
I don't know if you know him.
He's a bit of an artist artist.
He had a huge\ninfluence in my life.
And this is a piece,\nParallel Stress,
and it's his stress of his\nbody against the earth.
He also did this piece\nthat I absolutely
love that is called\nService Station for Ideas.
So your ideas come\naround and like,
you're not quite ready for them.
So they may need to get a\nlittle bit more gas in them
or a little bit more service.
But it's also a three\ndimensional landscape piece
that could be built out\nin the middle of nowhere.
And so it has this\nconceptual piece
to it and at the same\ntime a reality to form.
Then there is my very\ngood friend, Igor Mitoraj,
who I met in France wanting\nhim to do a sculpture for one
of my first projects in\na very hard neighborhood
with a lot of immigrants, a lot\nof violence, a lot of stress.
And he looked at\nmy models and said,
what are you doing with them?
And I said well, when I'm\ndone, I throw them away.
He said no.
He brought me tools\nfrom [? Carrara. ?]
He taught me to sculpt clay.
He took time to mentor\nme for over two years.
Huge influence in my life.
A wonderful man.
So, part of this lecture\nis about, why beauty?
What is important about beauty?
And David Brooks, I love this.
Beauty conquers the\ndeadening aspects of routine.
It educates the emotion,\nconnects us to the eternal,
by arousing the senses.
Beauty arouses\nthought and spirit.
John Donahue, The\nInvisible Embrace.
We feel most alive in\nthe presence of beauty,
for it meets the\nneeds of our soul.
Without beauty, the search for\ntruth, the desire for goodness,
the love of order and unity,\nwould be but sterile options.
Exploits.
I think a lot of\ntime in landscape,
we sort of forget\nabout the experiential.
And I often wonder\nabout what is it
about art that carries\nus through every piece?
And why are there certain\nthings that carry over time?
And it's the human spirit.
So, the bowl of fruit.
You can see a Dutch painting,\nyou can see a van Gogh,
and you can see a\ncontemporary installation.
But they're all doing fruit.
And so they are doing\nfruit because it feeds us.
It is essential to\nour nourishment.
And so we find\nbeauty in something
that is very spiritual.
But then we contextualize\nit with our culture.
So it's influence\nof our culture,
but there is something about us\nthat connects us all together
as the human spirit.
I love this painting by Matisse,\nbecause it talks about--
part of the things I\nwant to talk to you about
is, what is the influence of\nart on landscape architecture?
So I go through\nand I look at art.
I look at art all the time.
But why has Matisse\ndecided this is beautiful?
OK, so take a\npainting, analyze it.
This has a river below,\nreflecting light up.
The pathway is in\nprospect looking over.
The pathway is protected\non the side, dominance.
So, when you're\ndesigning a landscape,
think about what the\nexperiential at that landscape
is.
This is also a Matisse, which\nI find really interesting
in that, he's taken the river.
He's pulled the\nlight into the room.
He's made the room pull\nwater into the room and life
into the room from the river\ninto a cultural situation
into a living room.
So that carrying from\none natural aspect
or into a more intimate aspect\nis also part of designing.
This is another\nMatisse that I find
quite extraordinary because\nit talks about the future.
OK?
I am sorry, it's very hard to\nalways photograph paintings.
But see how the pathway turns,\nso you want to go that way?
See the void here?
The void is saying, you're\ngoing to go someplace.
See the shadow here?
It's highlighting the light\non this side, the light here.
See the solid wall here.
Everything's taking\nyou to a place.
Everything's leading\nyou to a place.
And so just drawing a line on\na plan is not going to do it.
It is much more about\nthis whole piece.
And I think when looking\nat art and seeing,
why does an artist\nthink this is beautiful,
will give you clues\nof how to create them.
So this is a Monet.
So you have to know\nEuropean landscape
to understand what this means.
This means a cemetery.
This evergreen is\nprobably a Taxus baccata.
This means over here\nthere's probably a house.
So this meadow says, I'm safe.
I've got a cemetery.
I got a house.
I'm not in the\nmiddle of nowhere.
I'm taken care of.
I have warm sunshine.
I've got distant horizons.
I've got safeness from view.
It's saying, safe,\ncomfortable, home, warm.
So I think it's\nreally interesting
that it creates an ambiance.
Now this is one of the\npicturesque paintings
that influenced many.
And the thing I find\ninteresting about this one
is that it talks about\nthose three scales
that we're always dealing from,\nforeground, meeting ground,
farground.
So, what is an\nimmediacy, right now?
What could happen?
And what do you want to happen?
And so those three\nscales are something
that happens in\nlandscape all the time.
Stowe is a really\ngood [? acts. ?]
If you haven't traveled\nto Stowe, please go.
It is the true picturesque.
Not what I call civic\ndecoration that really ruined
the picturesque in the 1800s.
But the 1730s, it was\nreally about creating
a readability of the land and\na discovering of the land.
And so this is what I call--
excuse me, I got it wrong.
I got the thing wrong.
Go back.
This is what I call\nthe object of desire.
So you want to go see this,\nbut there's no pathway.
There's a visual corridor.
The whole pathway takes\nyou around and then you
also you discover all\nthese other pieces.
This is a series of\npaintings and references.
And next summer are\nsome of our projects.
And I'm just trying\nto show you how
that influence of\nthose paintings
have influenced\nthe way I design.
And so this is\ncalled the journey.
And sitting there and\nsaying, what is the journey?
And then what is around\nthe corner of that journey?
This is amplification\nof a natural piece.
So my waterfall\nisn't quite as big.
But it talks about\nthat same feeling.
This is theatrical.
It's turn on one side.
This is a ribbon, 1,000\nmeters of gold ribbon
through the woods that\ntake you on a journey,
as this takes you on\na journey someplace.
And then, very important,\nand a little bit
what the interdiction\ntalked about,
I love classical principles.
I think there is\na balance to them.
I think there is a\nprinciple to them.
I think there is a force to\nthem, that they have something.
The reason they're classical,\nthey've been around
for forever, is they work.
You know?
And so, what is it about them\nthat works so beautifully?
And then this comes back\nto those three scales.
Foreground, meeting\nground round, farground.
Foreground, meeting\nground, farground.
And so always working in\nthat concept into the work.
I represent first\nmy previous work
in Paris from 1980 to 1997, then\nGustafson Porter Bowman 1997
to now.
And then the beautiful\nwomen at GGN and myself,
from 1999 to present.
So this is the London office.
Neil Porter, Mary Bowman,\nme, new partners, Sibylla
and Donncha.
And this is them.
And this is the three women\nof Gustafson Guthrie Nicol.
And then this is sort of a\ngroup photo of that office.
And we also have an office\nin D.C. So everything
that I will show you, I\nhave been design lead on.
But that doesn't\nmean it's everything
that's been done in the office.
Obviously, we're 90\npeople strong now.
We're nine partners.
There's no way I'm\ndesigning all of this.
Thank god, or I'd be nuts.
Through all the offices,\nthis is our mantra.
It is complicated.
You don't just do a one off and\ndesign a really good landscape.
There's all these things that\nyou have to get in there.
And you can read it.
You should know it.
But if your project isn't\nfulfilling every one of those,
then you haven't done your job.
See if I can go forward.
In Paris, this is actually\nmy very first project, 1983.
It's called Meeting Point.
And I'm not going to go too\nmuch into the conceptualization
of it.
But it was basically\nabout different systems.
How they meet.
And what do they do with\neach other when they meet?
So an example is that this\nis a really strong system.
This is a very fluid system.
So [? the strong ?] system\ntries to cut through the fluid.
The fluid doesn't care.
It just floats right over it.
So, in life there are different\nelements that come together.
And how they react to each\nother is constantly changing.
It's actually is a storm\nwater management piece.
We were moving 300,000\ncubic meters of earth
to be able to drain all\nthe fields around here
from flooding during\nthe spring rains.
This is a photo of that\nwas taken just last spring.
So it's still a wonderful piece.
It's still there.
And it doesn't look quite\nas sculptural anymore.
But it looks like it fits.
And that's really\nsort of what matters.
This is Every\nRights of Man 1990.
It's first time I\nput jets on pavement
and have that be a unique space.
Turn off the jets, and you\nhave a performance space
that everybody can use.
This is where the term full\nand empty and empty when full.
You want a space that, when\nnobody's there, is full,
so it's non-boring, right?
Like, the Boston Civic Center\nis horrible when it's empty.
So then, you also want\nthat space, when it's full,
that people can fill it.
So how do you make it\nflexible to be both?
And this was a\nperformance space that
was based on the 13th\nAmendment rights of man
in French called\nfreedom of expression.
And Francois Mitterrand\nopened the piece.
So this is Shell Petroleum.
Very iconic, everybody knows it.
But it's basically\nthe first roof garden.
There's five stories of\nparking underneath it.
And it's a very conceptual\nspace about what
Shell Petroleum does.
They basically go into the\nrock, they take out the fluid,
they refine it, and\nthey give us energy.
So it was the front\ndoor to Shell.
And it was a way to talk\nabout energy in a positive way
when we had just had Valdez\nhappen six months before.
And it's an incredibly\ngreat company.
This is a project--
I'm showing you old\npieces and new pieces.
This is a project that a\nlot of people haven't seen.
And I wanted to put it\nin here because I'm still
super proud of it.
And it shows, for people\nwho are starting out,
I did a lot of infrastructure\nin the beginning.
And this was a project.
This is the A4 that\ncomes from Paris
all the way down to Italy.
And this is the A55\nthat goes to Barcelona.
And this goes into the\ncenter of Marseille.
And the client asked\nus to take all of this
and make a new\nentry to Marseille
and put in one million\ncubic yards of soil that
was coming out of a tunnel.
To do it, and make it\na sculptural piece.
So one thing to\nnotice is there are
remnants of the pine forest.
And you see this rock\nstrata across here.
So this is a 1960s freeway\nexchange that just like,
ripped through the earth.
So how to put a million cubes\nin there is the basic idea.
I'm going to go back one.
I have 100 meter grade\nchange from here down here.
So this is a really steep slope.
There's agricultural\nplains here.
And this is my\nfirst sketch saying,
OK, you got to build walls so\nyou can fill in these areas.
See these black\npieces are walls.
And then, from all\nthe freeways, you've
got to collect all the water.
And we had to store the water\nsomeplace to slow it down.
It's also a tribute to four\nmen that died in my life
within two years.
So two brothers,\ntwo good friends.
So each color\nrepresents another man.
So, a pretty emotional\npiece for me.
So this is the big walls here\nthat give you directionality.
These are collecting all\nthe water coming down.
This is the main\nretention basin.
These are terraces\nthat move up that are
of the native planting.
And then these are the\nagricultural plains
to represent all the fields that\nare part of that plain here.
Then this is an olive\ngrove that connects
to the olive groves over\nhere, the pine forests
reconnected across.
This is the model.
And this was the first model\nI did in the United States
when I moved back here in 1997.
Actually, this was done in '95.
And it's 300 pounds of clay.
But you can see here--
sorry-- that this is where\nthe storm water collects.
And these are the\nterraces coming down.
I'm going to go back one.
I'm sorry, the two buttons here\nbetween forward and pointer
are both green, so I\nget slightly confused.
So the storm water\ncollects here.
And this is a land\nmovement all the way down.
And these are these huge\nwalls that retain this.
So that shows you where\nthe water is collected.
This is first time I did 3D.
This is Form Z. I\ndo Form Z. I do 3D.
I admit I can't do it anymore.
I can't do Rhino because\neverybody's faster than me now.
But, I do know the principles.
And I did do this model.
And this is what it looks like.
So, you have these\ngreat big, huge walls
that are holding up the earth.
And then this is that big basin.
And then you see\nthese water lines?
They're actually\nmeasuring and showing
the public how much\nimpermeabilization
has been going on.
And it shows how much\nwater has been retained.
This is what it\nlooked like before.
And this is what we filled in.
So those walls, you're going\nto see them in a minute,
came across here on\nthe terraces here.
And we actually got these\npylons in the same place,
but just raised up.
And all of this is using\nlocal stone in gabion walls.
You can see the size of a truck.
It's an absolutely\nmonumental piece.
You cannot visit it.
You can only see it at\napproximately 60 miles an hour.
So it's like [SNAPS].
So at the top of the\ncolumns is horizontal.
The lines are horizontal.
And the base is not.
And so that fills with water.
Back to what was done\nSeptember in the American
Museum of African-American\nHistory and Culture
was one of the most\nextraordinary experiences
I've had.
The landscape had\nthis huge challenge
of being in one of America's\nmost historical sites.
And the pressures\nwere extraordinary.
It took us nine\nyears to build it.
David Adjaye and Phil\nFreelon were the architects.
The biggest compliment I had\nwas from the critic for the New
York Times, I believe, said\nit's a great understatement.
And I couldn't have had a nicer\ncompliment in such a context.
Because it's the last\nthing you want to do
is try to upstage the Washington\nMonument and David Adjaye.
Not a great idea.
So I just want you to look\nat all Olin's work here,
all our work.
We're fitting into\na larger context.
So this is the inspiration\nfor David's museum.
The idea of a hat\nin Africa means
that you control your\ndestiny, that you actually
have property, that you\nactually have something.
So it's an honor to have a hat.
And you can see in the\nAfrican-American culture,
hats are still really important.
Also, the porch was very\nimportant to this concept.
I think you all\nknow where we are.
So the museum is here.
This is the Capitol, the\nWhite House, Lincoln.
This is called Union Square.
We're going to talk\nabout it in a bit.
The Mall.
The Reflection Pool,\nWashington Monument,
the Museum of American History.
Now our director, Lonnie\nBunch, was the director
of American History before.
You don't get more sensitive in\nAmerica than a site like this.
Everybody, everybody\nhas an opinion.
Everybody has friends\nof this, or friends
on the Mall, the\nWashington Planning
Commission, the National\nInstitution of Arts.
The process?
You just can't get\nnervous about it.
You just take your time.
You just keep working\nthrough it and through it
to make sure that you're getting\nthe right answer for everybody
in the room.
It's no longer about you.
It really isn't about you.
It really is about this context\nwithin the monumental core,
within the capital\nof this nation.
And that is important\nto a lot of people.
So I'm trying to understand\nthat importance of the friends
of the Washington Monument,\nthe oval, American Museum
of History, and our new museum.
We have a nine foot, three\nmeter drop from here to here.
If you know the\nMall, you come across
and then you have this like\nha-ha that goes lower here,
so cars can go through\nhere and your view
across to the Washington\nMonument never has cars on it.
It's beautifully designed.
Olin did an extraordinary\njob redesigning this
with all the security\nbarriers that
look like there's no\nsecurity barriers whatsoever.
It's one of the most\nbrilliant landscape
designs in the Washington\nD.C. and, actually, I
believe, in the world.
So, looking at that,\nanalyzing how that works,
there's these terraces that step\ndown and then all these lines
that connect to everything.
We have to figure out a place\nto put this museum so it
doesn't flood from Constitution,\nso it placed halfway between.
70% of our people\ncome in this way.
30% come in the other direction.
This is my first model.
I think it's kind of funny\nthat it looks like a fish.
You know, I got the fish,\ngot his eye, his tail.
He's about to swim away.
That everybody that\ncame in crossed waters.
And so they crossed on a boat.
There was something so\nreally wanted conceptually
that you crossed water\nto come into the museum.
You cross the\nthreshold of some sort.
And then-- sorry.
This is in the same\ngreen stuff keep.
I keep having\ndyslexia with green.
OK, pointer.
So again, getting it to\nfit into the context.
So fitting into the\ncontext and still having
that museum be its own place.
And David and I, right\nit in the beginning,
said, OK, what we really want is\nwe want the pavilion in a park,
because you have the\nWashington Monument grounds.
It's a huge park.
You're not going to create\nthis little garden on the side.
You're trying to make this.
And David is trying to\nput this museum there
that is finishing museum row.
So it's very important.
So these were the\ndifferent processes
that we went to say, OK, this\nis what it looks like today.
This is what it's going to\nlook like in the future.
This is what it looks like from\nthe Washington Monument today.
And this is how it's going\nto look in the future.
This is the final\nplan during schematic.
And you're going to\nsee, it does change
where the museum is here.
You cross water over.
This was a storm water\nmanagement piece here
that was collecting all the\nwater from the site here.
And this was a cultural\nfountain that you crossed water
to enter.
And so you move\nthrough the museum.
Remember there's\na nine foot drop.
We're right in the middle here.
That puts above flood\nline of Constitution.
One of the things about studying\nthe aspect of the movement
to the north is it was\nreally important how much
the lantern was, the moon was.
The moon showed you how\nto go along the river.
The river showed you\nhow to get places.
And then there was\nthe safe house.
And the safe house had quilts.
And if the quilt was\nout, it was safe.
If the candle was in\nthe window, it was safe.
If they weren't, it wasn't safe.
And so there's\nall this symbolism
through this culture\nthat's very important.
And in that, the lantern\nwas one of the main pieces
right at the entry that\nDavid really wanted.
And he wanted it to convey\nlight down below of the museum.
You see three stories above.
There are five stories below.
The majority of the\nmuseum is underground.
It is enormous.
And [? Applebon ?] has\ndone a fantastic job.
If you haven't\nbeen, you must go.
It's extraordinary\nwhat they did.
And David did a great job.
This is our landscape\ntrying to marry
the reflection of the\nmuseum's facade itself
in our stonework and the\ncoordination of the colors
and the pieces, really trying\nto make it feel like it's
one piece, one experience.
Part of that was that there\nare these circles of stories.
And they're called\nsinging circles.
Of course, we always do\nhuge amount of research.
And these singing circles are\nwhere the stories are told.
And Lonnie wanted us to\ndo a series of circles.
And so this is the\ndrawings for spirituality.
This is for hope and optimism.
It's the only one we were\nable to build, showing
the hand that is holding.
And doing the hope and optimism,\nwe built it out of metal.
We do a lot of furniture also.
And this is it built. And so\nit will be a place, hopefully,
that's not too hot once\nthose trees grow up,
because it is in metal,\nthat is a place of meeting
because Lonnie wants to be able\nto go outside and tell stories
about the culture and\nabout the history.
The north side is a fountain.
And this is where\nthe porch comes in.
And this is David's porch.
And putting the crossing\nwaters fountain here, but also
using that to bounce\nthe light off this
and reflect to the\nunderstory of this.
And the wind is\nconstantly moving this.
So this is moving.
But there is also this concept\nhere about agitation and calm.
And so in the history,\nthere is agitation.
There's the agitation\nthroughout history
with the African-American\nexperience in America.
But then there's calm.
And then there's solidness.
And so the fountain is made up\nof two pieces, a movement piece
and a mirror piece.
And the movement\npiece comes down
and the mirror\npiece comes across.
And there's a void between them.
And they never touch.
And that void goes all the\nway down to the basement,
so you have these two waters\nthat come in and go down.
And when you are in, looking\nout at the mirror piece,
you see yourself reflected, the\nWashington Monument reflected.
So you see yourself within the\nhistory of the United States.
So this is a CGI\nof that, showing
the movement water, the still\nwater, the Washington Monument.
This is my drawing\nof the movement.
I used the movement\nof birds, called
the [? hirondelle ?] in France.
Those little birds that all\nmove in [? murmurs ?] like,
oh, I don't know what\nyou call them in English.
But do you ever\nwatch those birds?
They know exactly\nwhere each other are.
And they move like this group.
And I felt as a\nsymbolism to this group
of African-Americans, as a\ncommunity, as in agitation they
are a community.
So I used that to create the\ntexture for the agitation.
And these are the\nprocess you go through.
And this is what it gives today.
So you see the mirror\npiece and the agitation.
And the work between the\nlandscape and the architecture.
So then David has\nthe sod, which is,
I don't know if you've been,\nbut it is pretty amazing.
So these are his models.
And then one day, he\nshows up with this.
It's dropped dead gorgeous.
I mean, it's just like,\nyou going to do what?
And that's going\nto be your facade?
Entire molded bronze?
No.
OK.
We can't do molded bronze.
We can't afford it.
But then there's the mock up.
And you just fall\nin love with it.
You've never seen\nanything like it
in Washington or anyplace\nelse in the world.
And it's just\nabsolutely beautiful.
And it's based on the iron work\nin New Orleans and traditions.
So there was [? a VE ?]\nof the landscape
to save the facade\nof the building.
And it's called Save the Corona.
And so, you can see this\nwater feature disappear.
There's a few other things that\ndisappeared in the landscape.
I think we're actually lucky\nwe saved as much as we could.
But it actually created\nthis wonderful opportunity
to create this new wall.
And can you figure\nout that scale?
Like it's like a\nwhole block long.
It's five meters wide.
It's 30 inches high.
It is big.
It is black.
It is polished granite.
And it is a security\nwall for blasts.
I love this wall.
I mean, it was so much better\nthan the water feature.
It is so bold.
The top is totally polished\nso it looks like water.
And then the front\nis totally this--
you have to cross through it.
And it has been beautifully\nbuilt, beautifully crafted,
that you can touch it.
It's sensual.
It's my big,\nbeautiful black wall.
And guess what?
It has become the\nbiggest hangout place.
It's full.
In the sun, that\nstone gets warm.
Everybody hangs out on it.
The food trucks come.
Everybody eats lunch there.
It has become this\nnatural gathering place.
Who would have thought?
And it's still in the\ncalm, lights water
reflects the museum.
One last thing blue is\nreally important color.
The beads in slave\nhouses meant that it's
passing through a threshold.
It's a safe place.
So we looked at crocuses\nfor National Black Month,
African-American Month.
And we planted 360,000 of them.
And still, just a wonderful\nplace that understatement
was a really nice complement.
It will be nice when the\ntrees get slightly bigger.
And it also was great to\nsee the Women's March.
This is Hong Kong.
It's called Taikoo Plaza.
And this is my first\nforay into China.
I'm not sure we can call Hong\nKong China but it's sort of.
And it's a private development.
Everything that is dark\nletters, my client owns it.
And they own all the\nstreets, also, by the way.
It's a company that's been\naround for a long time
called Swires.
And when aisle in the east\nis I think 78 stories.
It's the weirdest interview\nI've ever had in my life.
The first time I was\nthere, they had me
up at the 75th story\nin a desk at an office
right next to the piece of glass\nthat went right to the floor.
And I don't like elevators.
I made it through, but from\nthen on everything was fine.
They moved me to a lower floor.
But the project was that\nthis had buildings on it.
And so, they wanted to\nbuild two new towers here.
So they tore down\nthese buildings,
built underground\nparking garage,
and then there's a new\nbridge here up in the air
the first floor that\nconnects everything in space.
And then these were\nall loading docks,
and creating this in\nto food and beverage,
a new garden here, and then\nan event street over here.
So we're doing all of that.
And, at the time--
somebody asked me today, do you\never do something political.
Yeah, I do but I don't\noften tell people about it.
So this is during\nOccupy Hong Kong.
When I was first doing\nthe concept, so tradition,
transparency, and transition.
A lot of the problem\nwith Occupy Hong Kong
is nobody wanted to\nlose that tradition
but they wanted transparency\nin this transition
to this government.
And so it was very\nimportant these three words.
So they became the\nconcept for this space.
Transition.
If you hadn't been\nto Hong Kong, go.
It is so much fun.
It's like, the rock,\nnature, building.
And everything is\njust so exaggerated.
I love it because\nI hike, and so I
can be in the mountains in\nseven minutes from my hotel,
going straight up and\nin native vegetation.
But then you can go\nbuy beautiful things,
you can go learn things\nin beautiful museums,
great restaurants.
Just a really great city.
So, in looking at the tradition,\nit was really interesting
how there's always this mist.
Remember foreground,\nmeeting ground, far ground?
Far ground is, what is the\nfuture, do we know the future.
It's something about the\neternal that is moving through,
but at the same time,\nall the structures
are quite build rectilinear\nover a very organic landscape.
So this is the concept, and\nit's called Transparencies.
That you need that\ntransparency, where
you go through these veils.
And the veils are water,\nlight, vegetation.
And as you move\nthrough these veils,
there's a bright\nlight of the future.
Foreground, medium\nground, farground.
And moving through\nthese veils means you're
transitioning through time.
And so there was a five\nmeter drop in the site
and through that drop\nthere was these bridges.
And I wanted\nunderneath the bridge
to be like, party space,\nbright lights, fun,
but then you move\nthrough the mist.
And you step down\nthrough these veils.
These are my sketches.
And these veils can be again,\nvegetation, light, or water.
And this is one of\nmy first sketches
of, so there's these\nlines of water,
lines of vegetation coming\nthrough, that you move through
in a linear manner.
And this is another sketch\nof these lines of veils.
And you're stepping down from\nup here, the five meters as it
moves through.
This is the plan.
The high point is here, so\njust call this plus 5, 0, 0, 0.
Really steep, flat,\nflat, somewhat steep.
And bridge comes around\nhere, all the way through.
So, it's a reverse\nof what was happening
in the Chinese gardens.
The bridge, by [? Hugh ?]\n[? Dutton ?] architecture,
is all sort of Zaha Hadid fluid.
So I did all the streets.
So I sort of reversed\nthe whole thing.
He's like, really\nflipped out and said,
you're undermining the bridge.
And I said, no, I'm\nhighlighting it,
so it's different\nfrom the landscape.
This is the bridge.
And the landscape has this is\nreally ordered piece to it.
And this shows,\nthis section across,
how you're under the\nbridge, lots of range
so you're protected.
Then a waterfall comes down here\nand so you're stepping down.
You'll understand\nmore as I go through.
This is a long section that\nshows, again, the highest
point.
And as you move\nthrough, the veils.
And this is another CDI that\nshows the high points up here.
This is the long pool waterfall.
This is the oval pool.
There's a waterfall\nbetween them.
And then all these lines.
And there were waterfalls\ncoming off the bridge that got
[? VEA-ed ?] out.
This is the first 3D\nmodel built in the office.
And there's something\nwrong with it.
I just couldn't figure out\nwhy it just didn't feel right.
So I did what I usually do.
I took it back into clay.
And said no, we're going\nto, I'm taking control here.
Why is it not working?
And basically, it was too tight.
And so, this is the long\npool, the oval pool,
and the water table.
The bridge comes\nover the top here
and you're terracing down this\nway, or you move down this way.
Basically, you move all\nthe way through this.
You can come through here,\nor you can come down there,
you can come down here\nand you can do that.
Everything's handicap accessible\nto all different plateaus.
You see how rectilinear\nit is, which is
sort of a big departure for me?
But it also was a way\nto pull those veils
and just like, [? extrude ?]\nthem down and give it
the force it needed.
So then, how do you make\nthose feel more sculptural?
How do you start\nto work with them?
One of the sketches, and\nthen starting to work in 3-D,
how do you move the water?
And what is the texture\nthat moves the water?
This is our texture\nmoving through what
is called the long pool.
And it's a water cascade\ncoming down here.
The bridge is over here.
And this is looking again at\nthe long pool coming down.
The oval pool is over here.
You can see the bridge\nis over the top.
Very tropical or\nvery lush planting.
And then back into 3D, refitting\nthe 3D to match the model
and then adjusting it.
And then from that,\nwe go from our 3-D
to cut poly Styrofoam to\ntesting the water fullscale, one
on one, to make sure it works.
And we're also doing\nall the lobbies
and all the public floors.
Half of the office\nare architects.
Neil Porter is an architect.
I did not do this.
This is Neil's work.
I would not have a clue\nwhat to do with a lobby.
And he does just\nbeautiful work, so.
But he basically carried the\nlandscape inside with veils,
again, that represent all\nthe veils of the concept.
And I did the vegetation.
This is Washington\nD.C. By the way,
this is under construction,\nthe Hong Kong project.
The buildings are demolished.
We're down into\nthe first basement.
It is happening and it's\nhappening really fast.
As they say in China,\nthey don't wait around.
It's impressive.
I've been working on a project\nin Singapore for 10 years,
and it still isn't\nin the ground.
I have another one that's\ncoming out of the ground,
but one isn't.
This is a competition\nthat we won.
And I want to show\nit because I think,
again, it represents context.
Paying attention to context.
Trying to bring something\ncontemporary into a very, very
coveted landscape in\nthe United States,
which is the National Mall.
It's nervous working\non the National Mall.
I cannot tell you\nhow nervous it is.
Everybody's eyes are on you.
And so, when we first looked\nat this, it was playing,
you know--
I'm so glad I'd been working\nthere for eight years
before I even\nattempted this one.
But this is the site.
It's right here.
It's called Union Square.
This is the Capitol.
This is the White House.
This is Pennsylvania\nAvenue, connects the two.
This is Andrew Grant here,\nthe general, looking across
at his President,\nLincoln, that created
the Union after the Civil War.
I mean, the whole place, and\nthen the Washington Monument.
This is the Mall.
This is the Washington Monument\ngrounds, oval, tidal basin,
reflection pool, and the\nConstitution Gardens are here.
One of the great things\nabout Washington D.C.
is the height control\nof the buildings.
But it's very, very dense\nbecause of the height control.
And the thing about the Mall is,\nall of a sudden, everything's
open as soon as\nyou hit the Mall.
And it's got this\nhuge open space.
And so people that live\nthere run in the morning,
you play ball\nafter work, I mean,
it's a very lived in space.
But at the same time, it\nrepresents this nation.
And this is the view of a water\nfeature that is there today.
This is the Grant\nMemorial, the Capitol.
And this is your\npicture postcard
that the Speaker of\nthe House at the time
absolutely wanted to maintain.
And this was a\nplace of gathering
of the presidential\ninaugurations,
the local visitors, but it also\nwas this huge, ugly 1960 basin
that was just leaking\ngallons of water.
And look at the\nsize of this thing.
If you came from\nthe Mall, I mean
you couldn't get to the Capitol.
Look at the size\nof the building.
You had to walk all\nthe way around here
even to get an access.
And so people would do\nthese dog paths trying
to get around this thing.
And it was lower than here,\nso even as you're coming down
the Mall, you didn't\neven see it til
you were like, on top of it.
It is a Dan Kiley SOM, so\nI shouldn't criticize it
quite so badly.
But it's probably more\nSOM than Dan Kiley.
But you can see how\nit really blocks
this whole piece the was.
Another thing to know is that\nthis is what was happening.
These-- shoot, I\nkeep messing up.
Sorry.
These [? dog house ?]\nthat keep being created.
And you can see them here.
But it's really\nthe accessibility.
And these dark spaces are\ntrees and the open spaces
are without trees.
Historically, you have\nL'Enfant Plan, 1791.
Really important how there\nwas a canal through here.
Basically, we're in a swamp.
And then there's this\ndrainage of the swamp that
was happening in the canal\nhere in the capitol here
and Pennsylvania.
Then, going through,\nthe botanical gardens
used to be this.
As you move through, we had\nthe McMillan Plan, 1901,
that created sort of\nlike a Concord plaza
with a fountain and\na fountain here.
McMillan plan was\nnot built. Look
at these dates, 1932 to 1936.
What happened in 1929?
Crash of the Market, no money.
Nobody had any money\nto build anything.
So we went back to the\nsimplest plan possible,
just carrying them all through.
Reserve the botanical\ngarden here and just
fill it with trees.
OK?
So I think a lot of things\nhappen for economic reasons.
And it is a Frederick\nLaw Olmsted Jr. plan.
So we looked at that and said,\nOK, we've got a big thing here.
We've got a big thing here.
We've got a big thing here.
We don't put a big thing there.
Right?
We've got enough big things.
And so how do we just connect\nthis whole thing through?
We want to connect Lincoln\nto his general, right?
And we want to make sure that's\ndone in a really clear way.
What we worked on is that\nthis was a connector piece.
And so we're looking\nat this piece.
We have Union Square here, Union\nStation, which is the train
station, Pennsylvania.
We really needed to connect\nin all different areas
and not make it a separate area.
This is a sketch\nsaying, you know,
the Union was pulled apart\nduring the Civil War.
So it's like this\npuzzle of pieces
that you're trying to\npull back together.
And that actually is\nthe plan of the garden.
And you'll see all these lines\nwhen you see it in a moment.
This is where we are in\nour proposal that won.
And I'll try to\nexplain it to you
because it's this entire piece.
Museum Row is on either side.
This is the Mall, the Capitol,\nand this is a tilted lawn
that has events on it.
And what we proposed is a\ncentral water feature here.
And it's basically\na tri-part scheme.
Instead of trying to make this\nwhole thing into one piece,
we made this part\na Union Square,
this about the botanical garden,\nand this a botanical garden.
So these two became\nliving landscape museums
that completed the museum\nalley at this Museum Row.
The way this is composed\nis we're going back
to Mannerism and Michelangelo.
So you see the two museum\nrows, then the centerpiece.
And that is based on a\n[? perspectival. ?] Now,
there's two reasons to do this.
One, this monument\nis slightly larger
at this end then the\nend of the Mall here.
And unfortunately, they didn't\neven put the statue on access
with the Capitol.
So, you're trying to make\nsomething look symmetrical
that is not symmetric.
So you've got to sort\nof fake things a bit.
But also, if you use Mannerism,\nif you take those lines
and make them\nparallel, the Capitol
is going to look farther away.
If you open up the\nend, the Capitol
is going to come towards you\nand look more monumental.
And also, to the visitor, it's\ngoing to look closer and easier
to walk to.
[LAUGHTER]
No, it's important.
I mean, experiential.
What are you experiencing?
These people, they\nhave two, four kids.
It's hot.
They're sweaty.
They've been walking all day.
And they're supposed to get\nto the visitor's center.
And they got to\nclimb up this hill.
And so, you watch them.
I mean, they're dragging\ntheir bods across here,
and then they're trying\nto go around this thing.
2nd Street doesn't go through.
There is a barrier over here.
Anyway, we're trying to make it\nmuch more accessible, much more
part of it.
And at the same\ntime, Boehner, you
know, Speaker of the\nHouse at the time--
actually wish he\nwas still there--
he wanted his view.
And so we really framed\nthat view exactly the way
they saw the view before.
And you have to understand, his\noffice is like, right there.
And it looks down at this.
And he didn't want\nhis view changed.
Speaker of the House.
OK, so, it's like, you\ndon't change his view.
Then you have this\nbeautiful lawn
that comes up to the Capitol,\nso to create that as a bowl,
and frame it, I raised\neach side with terraces
that made this one composition.
And then created these as\nbeing separate compositions.
And you can see the\nsize of the terraces.
Now, this is a football\nfield for scale.
OK?
This is a big piece.
And we put in 2nd Avenue across.
You can see how\nmuch we increased
from what was the\ncirculation before to what
is the circulation now.
You can see before,\nhow it came here?
Bump.
Go all the way around.
And that's what is\nin our proposal.
I still hope we're going\nto get it built one day.
Then the fountain.
It's made up of five panels.
And these are the terraces\nthat I spoke about earlier that
framed that space here.
And this is a view\nfrom those terraces
across to the fountain.
And this is what I\ncall the Beatles White
Page, walking across water.
So that sort of float feeling?
And the way this is built\nis that the center fountain
has these five panels.
All those panels can be\nemptied into a trough,
and then recycled back,\nor each one of them
can be turned on separately.
So you can have a event with\nall the fountains on, you know,
first initiation.
Welcome to America.
This is who we are.
To, I want to do one event.
I want to do the inauguration.
I want to do a fair.
I wanted to have an event.
So you can turn off\neach panel separately.
And none of them has\nwater over four inches.
Nobody can drown.
Everybody can walk across it.
Totally safe.
Or, you can put a stage here\nand have another event here
with this as your backdrop.
That shows the botanical\ngarden grounds.
That shows what is\ncalled Emerging Voices.
The Emerging Voices came\nfrom a program for youth,
and so we've created it a\nlittle bit like [? Chemoix ?]
[? sur ?] [? le ?] [? Way. ?]\nIt's a series of pocket gardens
that different youth display\nwhat they're doing today
in their studies.
It could be science.
It could be anything.
And so there is a small\nmuseum that goes with it.
Davis [? Bourdieu ?]\n[? Braund ?] was our partner
in this.
And so, this becomes\nanother program element.
And for the botanical\ngarden, it's
all about native plants of\nthe Washington D.C. area
only, whereas the\nnormal botanical
has a much broader venue\nfor the botanical, which
is paleontology and everything\nelse that goes with it.
This is Pennsylvania Avenue.
It's a parking garage right now.
It's full of parking.
So we repaved it,\nmade it pedestrian,
and made it a space\nas an event space.
And this is a view\nof Emerging Voices.
So, different youth,\ndifferent displays.
And this shows what that\nsmall museum might be,
what the big fountain, the\nnew lawn, the terraces.
And this is the storm water\nmanagement of the piece.
KPF Drew [? Genghis, ?] one\nof the best civil engineers
I loved working with\nis really creative.
We are zero water, zero energy.
And we recycle all our\nown sewage and waste.
And you get to walk on water.
Or have a concert.
And you still have Lincoln.
I think there is a\nrepeat in images here.
I don't know what happened.
Sorry about this.
Maybe I gave her the\nwrong PowerPoint.
I hope the other\nprojects are in here.
I like this quote.
"It\'s a danger to wait around\nfor an idea to occur to you.
You have to find the idea."
This is a very different\nkind of project.
And it's the Venice Biennale.
And it was in 2008.
Aaron Betsky was\nthe commissaire,
and he called me up\nlike, way too late.
Like, April for August, right?
Because the original\ncommissaire died,
he got appointed too late.
You know, it was a mess.
And he said, come and\ndo a paradise garden.
And I said, yeah, sure, OK.
Then I started looking\naround and said well,
where am I going to\ndo a paradise garden?
And he said, well,\nwhy don't you do
in the garden of the\nChinese pavilion?
Well, the Chinese didn't\nwant me to do something
in their pavilion.
And so I got on Google Earth.
And I said, hey, there's\nthis piece of land here.
And so, it was this\nwhole area here.
And the Chinese\npavilion is here.
The Italian pavilion is here.
The Corderie is here.
This is all water.
Sorry, it's just a line drawing.
We actually took up way\nmore than we should have.
I had never done the Biennale.
I didn't realize\nI should have done
a really small little thing.
Instead, I did\nlike, three acres,
and we had to finance\nit all ourselves.
So this is the site\nwhen we arrived.
It's this beautiful tower.
And then we find this place.
And it's covered in bramble.
And the trees are just\nlike, dying from ivy.
And it was a real challenge.
The concept about\nparadise was that--
am I going really\nover time here?
OK.
I'll finish just this\none, then I'll stop.
I can't tell you how to\nget to paradise, right?
But what I can say is--
my idea on this was take\nstock in what you remember.
OK, so what have you lost?
It's really important to\nunderstand what you've lost.
And then, what nourishes you?
What gives you joy?
And then take those two\nthings together and sit down
and think about your\nlife and enlightenment.
What is going to be\nparadise for you?
And so, doing that created\na series of sketches, where
we first had the storeroom,\nwhere it was images
of all the different\nspecies of plants we
have lost due to\nhuman pollution.
And then, they carve through\nthe bramble, these pieces,
to get to nourishment, which\nwas this big vegetable garden.
And then you go\nto enlightenment,
a land sculpture\nwhere you lay down
and you think about your future.
This is the site.
There was a church here.
This was the original\nvegetable garden.
We actually laid down\nprotection over archeology
and added soil on top so we\nnever touched the archeology.
This is the storeroom here,\nwhere it's remembrance.
And this is the nourishment,\nthe vegetable garden.
And this is enlightenment.
This is the images\nof the storeroom.
And Smithsonian help\nus with all the list.
And [? Ghikelani, ?]\nthe lighting company,
did all the lighting for free.
And I have to say, we raised all\nthe money with American funds
from the United States.
We raised $250,000.
These are the carved\npathways through, and then
this wonderful man, who\ncreated the vegetable garden,
because I had literal charts.
You germinate the\nseed here, it takes
this long, because everything\nhad to bloom on August 15,
right?
And so, no vegetable\ngarden blooms.
[INAUDIBLE] So I came\nto this guy who says--
you know, 75-year-old Italian\nplants man with my chart--
anyway, don't worry,\ndear, it'll be fine.
And he was absolutely right.
It was absolutely beautiful.
I did take inspiration\nfrom Louise Bourgeois.
At the end of her life, she was\nmaking sculpture out of fabric
and sewing fabric.
So, I got back out my sewing\nmachine, because fashion,
and I hand-did the face that\nis a woman scarecrow with 501
jeans, a Pendleton jacket,\nand a redhead wick,
which was stolen\nwithin four days.
But it was this wonderful\nvegetable garden.
People came.
They could eat things.
They could rest on benches.
There was roses.
It was, after the\nMediterranean garden,
where-- everything in your house\ngoes into the vegetable garden.
So it's your flowers,\nyour herbs, and your food.
Where the English put the\nkitchen garden, the flower
garden, cut garden, separately.
The Italians didn't.
The French, they\nmix it all together.
And we had baskets of food that\npeople would come in and eat.
It was lovely.
It was absolutely lovely.
And then, enlightenment.
You know how, in all the\nreligious things, where
you're going up\nto heaven, there's
all these fabric going up.
And you're going up\nto heaven, so I wanted
fabric flying in the air.
And Neil and I talked about\nthe fabric flying in the air.
And so, we flew\nfabric in the air.
First we had to create land\nmovement of enlightenment.
This is my clay model.
And the idea is to create\na place of the prince,
so you can lay down there\nand nobody can see you.
And you can look at the fabric\ngoing up to enlightenment,
and you can imagine your\nparadise and your future.
And then you've got to get up\nand go do something about it.
So these are the\nbottles of how you
walk into that space and\nsome other photographs of it.
And then it started to\nbe built. All the fabric,
they were 30 meters\nlong by 15 meters wide.
There are two of them.
Ripstop, nylon.
And I did all the models\nin reduced, miniature form
in my studio shop, with\nfans blowing at them
and slips in them and things.
And then we just took a chance\nand, you know, they worked.
But they're helium\nballoons that held him up.
And we had these guys\nfrom England come down
and do all the balloon stuff.
You can see the land\nmove and there's
the place of the prince\nwhere you get to hide.
And then you fly the plans.
And there they go\n[MAKING NOISES]
because there are only two.
There are not three, right?
So the wind will push\nthe balloons up and down.
And so they just keep moving.
And at night, they're\nabsolutely fantastic.
And Aaron Betsky has his\n50th birthday party there.
They were really amazing.
And I think that's\nmy last slide.
We'll find out.
Yep.
[APPLAUSE]
Do you have enough energy\nfor some questions?
Yeah, I can always\nanswer some questions.
Thank you, Kathryn.
Wonderful talk.
Some people have to file out,\nbut I know there will be--
Sorry I went on too long.
That's OK.
While you're preparing your\nquestions, I have one for you.
Yeah.
I'd love if you\nwould say something
about the role of\nmaking drawings by hand
and making models by hand.
Because we seem to be losing it,\nbut you haven't lost it at all.
Well, I think that when\nyou actually draw or model
with your hands to scale, and\nyou had crit reviews today,
heard me say, you've\ngot to do it by hand.
There's something about\ndrawing that section
by hand, your pencil\nputting a person in there.
And all of a sudden, you\nare inside that drawing.
There's no other way\nto be inside a drawing.
You can't be inside a 3D\ncomputer screen that is 2D.
I mean, you're\nfalsifying right away,
because you're looking at\na 2D image of the 3D thing.
Where, when you're\nactually drawing it,
you are actually in the reality.
And for myself, on the\nmodels, I have little people.
I've got my head down.
You can't lie in a model.
If you have forgotten\nto put that point,
it goes on to\ninfinity and you have
that open in your\nmodel on the computer,
and there's a hole into\nthe end of the world there?
You know, you can't do that\nwhen you're on a physical model.
That hole is saying, fill me up.
You forgot me.
There's something over here.
You haven't figured it out.
So for me, it's\nreally important.
But, I am old school.
Section, section, section.
It is the best to know what is\nthe scale of what you're doing.
It's clear that it's generative.
And then you're talking\nabout it being descriptive.
You draw the section\nand understand scale.
But, it's also recuperative.
The Hong Kong\nexample is one where
you were critical about what\nyou saw in the 3D and went back
and did it by hand\nto recalibrate.
Questions?
There's another mic.
I have one.
Can you wait for the mic?
Kathryn, you work\nwith infrastructure.
And you have big ideas.
And conceptual ideas.
But you also care about plants.
And you know your plants.
Can you talk about how you came\nto know plants or appreciate
them?
It's not really fair.
I've worked with [? Meg, ?]\nand so she's just
been like flabbergast--
I'm just buried with plants\nfor me, which was great fun.
When I first started\nout, I didn't plant.
I only did land movement.
And I put a few trees, because\nI didn't know what I was doing.
I mean, plants are\nreally complicated.
And so, for years, I would read\na half an hour every morning.
And I would choose subjects.
Let's do viburnums.
OK.
You know, I'd do family of\nviburnums for like, two months.
And then I'd do a\nproject with viburnums.
And then I would go through\nand say, OK, let's do conifers.
And so, it was really\njust a methodical
going through years\nand years of study.
And then one day, I got my\nown garden and planted it.
You know, I only lost 10%.
And I thought, you know,\nI did learn something.
You don't have to have a garden.
You can actually learn by book\nlearning, walking scene, going
to nurseries, experiencing.
It is better if you have a\nlittle place to experiment with
and fail.
And then, the other thing\nis learn your families.
I think that's someone\nthat Dan Hinkley taught
me, who is a really wonderful\nplant expert and one of my best
friends.
Having plant experts nuts\nhelps because they keep
talking to you all the time.
Both my parents are master\ngardeners, so that does help.
They just like,\nplant bombarded me.
My dad was trees and\nshrubs, my mother
was perennials and roses.
And she also was a\nnative plant expert.
She could take you\ninto the forest
and tell you absolutely\neverything you could eat.
And I've spent my life going\nthrough the mountains with her.
So I think there's a lot of\nthings that happened to me.
And when I first\nstarted, I was doing
much more sculptural landscape.
And now, I just have fallen in\nlove more and more with plants.
And I can't go to a nursery\nwithout spending way too
much money.
They're wonderful.
They're wonderful friends.
And they change all the time.
It's a really steep\nroom, isn't it?
It is.
I wanted to ask about\na lot of the projects.
And you begin with talking\nabout being focused
on the experience,\nthe what it feels
like to be in a landscape.
And I'm wondering\nhow you stay grounded
in that when you do the big\nprojects, the big scale stuff.
I think it's a\nreally good question,
because on the\nreally big projects,
there's a lot of\npressures happening
from a lot of different angles.
You saw in the\nHong Kong piece, I
put down in the beginning\nwhat I want it to feel like.
I want it to be immersive.
I wanted veils.
I wanted these\ncolors, these sounds.
And I try to hold into that.
The National Museum of\nAfrican-American History
and Culture, the pavilion in\na park, trying to hold that.
I think that if your concept\nis clear enough, and fits,
you can hold onto it.
And it's going to\nget pushed around
on the really big project.
There's all sorts\nof constraints.
I can't even go into\nwhere they all come from.
But I think you can.
It's obviously on\na smaller project
much easier to do, especially\none without an architect.
Well, it's true,\nbecause you're not
dealing with another person\nwho wants to design everything
in the world also.
Right?
I've heard of that.
Let's have one more question.
There's a woman right there.
These are so annoying.
You've got to figure\nthis thing out.
I was wondering\nif you could speak
for a minute about the\npractice side of your life.
I loved hearing about your\ninfluences, and creativity,
but you were brave\nenough to run two firms.
And if you could talk a little\nbit about how you work those,
what to me are kind of\ncompeting sides of the business
side and creative side.
First off, I do\nnot run two firms.
We're nine partners.
And the secret is nine partners.
And nine very talented partners.
As you know, I\nmean, I don't know
how I got such great partners,\nbut I have great partners.
And there's sort of\na saying we have.
It's, we talk until we agree.
And I think it's really\nimportant, that communication
and that patience.
And that also is\nthat design matters.
And design is the root of\nour identity and our culture.
And our ethics are\nall the same also.
So, honesty, really\nbeing ethical,
and being design driven.
That holds this group together.
I ran my own office of 16\npeople without any problem.
And once you start having\nother people help you,
it has all those dimensions.
And the other thing is,\nyour partner should never
be like you.
You should only be the person\nthat can do what you do.
And they should be only the\nperson that do what they do.
And so that diversity is what\nmakes it a really interesting
partnership.
But then the firms\nare interesting
because their cultural in\nthat way, that everybody
has like that Georgia O'Keefe.
The first statement is,\nmake your unknown known.
I think that's part\nof the secret to it.
That's beautiful.
Thank you all for being here.
Kathryn, it's fantastic\nhaving you here.
You're going to\ntake me to dinner?
I am.
OK.
[APPLAUSE]
