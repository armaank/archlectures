Good evening.
If I could kindly\nhave your attention,
I'm delighted to\nintroduce and welcome
Alison Brooks, who's\nteaching at option studio
here this semester.
This year marks the\n22nd anniversary
of Alison Brooks's practice,\nwhich Alison opened
after seven years as partnered\nwith Ron Arad Associates,
where she worked on projects\nsuch as the foyer of the Tel
Aviv Opera House.
If often think if we\nmeasured years as distance
in one's career, I\nthink 20-odd years
would be considered\nto be long distance
in many other professions\nor disciplines.
But it's not often the\ncase in architecture.
We think about Le Corbusier's\n60 year career, or Frank Lloyd
Wright's 70 year career,\nbut in many ways,
I think Alison's\ntrajectory is one
that belongs to this\nlong distance mentality.
As opposed to the ones\nwhose career accelerated
at the outset, I\nthink Alison belongs
to a secular sector, a\ngroup of perennial outsiders
who are on the slow burn.
This group-- they're very good.
They're very serious\nabout the work.
They're not on the fast\ntrack, but pursuing
their own architectural\ninterests with a tenacity,
with quirkiness and confidence,\nand producing quietly
subversive work.
While many of us-- so some\nof us have been following
her work for a long time.
I think many outside\nof architecture--
the architectural\ncognoscenti might not
be aware of Alison's work\nuntil the debut of the pavilion
called the Smile, designed for\nthe London Design Festival.
And those of you who've been\nto London in recent years,
even if you have not noticed\nthe distinguished vertical forms
throughout the\ncity, a taxi driver
could tell you which one\nis the Gherkin, which
one is the Shard, which one\nis the Walkie Talkie, which
one is the Cheese Grater,\nwhich one is the Can of Ham.
You can practically\nhave a picnic.
So I think in 2006 it was\nvery refreshing to experience
a more horizontal, a more\nephemeral model named
the Smile.
The project itself is an\naccomplishment from a design,
from a structural, and\nmaterial standpoint.
Alison Brooks was born\nin Ontario, Canada.
She moved to London after\nstudying architecture
at Waterloo, and over the many\nyears she won many awards.
She is the only UK\npractice to have
won RIBA's three most\nprestigious architecture
prizes.
That includes the Stirling\nPrize, the Mensa medal,
and the Stephen Lawrence Prize.
Alison herself was\nawarded the AJ Woman
Architect of the Year in 2013.
And after many years\nof honing her craft,
Alison's practice is booming.
Her work now encompasses\nurban design, housing,
education buildings, and\nbuildings for the arts.
Although many of the projects\nare designed very distinctive
for very specific\ncases and sites,
I think one could\ntrace her [inaudible]
throughout her work.
There's always a strong\ncommitment to the public realm.
There's a vast\nknowledge and commitment
to the history of\nurban typology,
as one could see the use and\ntransformation of type such as
[? mies, ?] or quads,\nor arcades in her work.
Her work often bridges between\nthe Victorian or Georgian
historical fabric of London,\nand the brutalist work
from the 1960s.
She really understands her\nwork as a process of healing
or stitching this urban fabric.
I think on the surface--
I think Alison is a\nmodernist architect.
There's clearly a sensitivity to\nmaterials, context, and scale,
but I think behind\nthat type of politeness
there's a strong\nrigor and insistence.
Those of you who\nmight have heard her--
heard her say things like she\ninsists on designing nothing
under 2.6 meters for\na room height, which
is like eight and a half feet.
Or there's nothing better\nthan a French door,
so why reinvent it?
But what I love about\nthis dichotomy--
this dichotomy that she has\nbetween restraint and rigor
is very different\nfrom those [inaudible]
kind of strict\ndivision between, let's
say, a reserved\ngentlemanly facade
for this Georgian exterior with\na hedonistic luxurious interior
hidden within the inside.
Her work kind of\ndeals with these two
opposites by oscillating\nconstantly between the two,
so it's always an act in motion.
And to end my\nintroduction, I'd like
to quote one of our\ndistinguished alumnus, John
[? hader. ?] He said there's\na short distance runner
architect, and there's a long\ndistance runner architect.
The short distance runner is\njust that-- a short distance
runner.
The short distance runner's\ntrail is straight, flat,
and the end can be seen.
The short distance runner\nis a crowd pleaser.
The short distance runner runs\nfast and is soon out of breath.
The long distance runner's\nscope is simply vaster.
The long distance runner\ntraverses a more complex
landscape.
The long distance runner\ngets better with age.
The long distance runner's\ndistance is extended.
The long distance runner's\narchitecture at once
because sparser and richer.
So I hope after this\nlecture it leaves no doubt
that Alison Brooks has\nsigned on as a long distance
runner traversing through the\nlong and treacherous terrain
demanded of every architect.
So please join me\nin welcoming Alison.
[applause]
Thank you, Mark.
And thank you for inviting\nme to lecture, to teach.
I'm really enjoying my first few\nweeks of teaching at the GSD.
It's a real honor,\nand, well, I hope
I live up to the long distance\nrunner sort of accolade
that you've given me,\nwhich is, I think,
something that most\narchitects hope they have.
It sort of reminds me of\nanother quotation from Corb,
which is creation\nis a patient search.
And so we all have to be\npatient and keep searching.
So I've called this talk\nModel Building Model, which
is kind of unusual--
Making Oxford's New\nCollegiate Architecture.
But I'm going to talk about\nmore than just models.
I'm going to first give\nyou a bit of a preamble
as to my practice and what I've\nbeen doing for the last 20,
21 years--
coming up to 22--
in practice and actually\n30 years in London.
So my office is based\nin London, and I
range between 30 and 40\npeople in my practice.
And here you can see a kind\nof funny series of maps, where
the UK is really huge, and\na lot of my work is there,
and North America\nis really tiny,
but I have my biggest\njob in Vancouver
at the moment-- a\nseries of towers.
I've also done work in\nEurope, and my first project
in Helgeland in the middle of\nthe North Sea, an island, a spa
hotel, which you can just about\nsee up there on the right.
And recently I've been\nasked to do work in Moscow,
and Australia, and\nelsewhere around the world.
So it's kind of nice\nbeing borderless, I think.
One of the good things about\nbeing a foreigner in London
is London embraces\nyou, and I think
it gives you a certain distance\nfrom the kind of class system
and other things that\nsort of hinder the UK,
but at the same time, it's\nvery much a world city,
and it's completely inclusive.
So this is, in a way,\nmy mental map of London.
It's a very green city and\nvery dense, and it spreads.
It sort of goes on forever,\nbut you can very clearly
see the pockets of green.
And then a different kind of\nmap, where the green is black,
and this is a kind of\ndensity map of London.
And you can see it's\ngenerally low density.
There's a kind of hotspots in\nred where the city of London is
and new developments\nin South London,
but it's kind of an amazing\norganic European city
and without the kind of huge\ngestures from many monarchies,
because it was parliamentary\ndemocracy very early.
It doesn't have the huge sort\nof gestures that normally define
European cities, but it\nhas amazing qualities,
such as the garden square,\nthe terraced block.
This is Bedford square,\nfor those of you
who haven't been there.
This is where the AA is, and\nBedford square and the AA
was the reason for me\nmoving to London in 1988.
My school was very close, sort\nof intellectually to the AA,
and I felt a sort of\nfamiliarity when I came here.
And Fitzrovia, and\nBloomsbury, and the garden
squares that define\nLondon are one
of the great sort of contexts\nthat you work within in London.
And the these images that\nobviously the Georgian
terraced houses\nof either the AA--
now they're adapted to\nbe university buildings,
or doctors' offices,\nhotels, any number of uses,
and the kind of\ngreat adaptability
of that Georgian\narchitecture is something
I've learned a lot from.
It's also the first minimalism.
There's a kind of amazing\nbreak in British architecture
when it sort of departed from\nthe Baroque or the Renaissance
tradition and went\ncompletely minimalist to suit
the Georgian developers, and\nso that brick-- stripped down
brick and white window\nframes are very much
developer architecture, but\nalso civic architecture.
And London's also\ngot great places
like Somerset House, which\nis one of my favorite places
in London.
That's a 300 year old quadrangle\nthat presents a very urban
frontage to the Strand, and\nthen has this incredible oasis,
which is a public . square.
And, well, it's actually\nthe first example
of a mixed use urban typology\nanywhere in the world
containing arts\ninstitutes, offices,
navy offices, tax office--
everything under the sun.
And so this context of London--
here you can see Regent's Park\nand some of the Nash Crescents.
This is Regent's Park here.
London's fabric-- it's\nkind of messy fabric--
is interrupted by\nfantastic green spaces.
And so I'm very\ngrateful to London
because it allowed me to,\nin a way, start my practice
and do things that\nI think might not
have been able to do if\nI'd stayed in North America
or in Canada.
And one of the\nvery first projects
I had when I started my\npractice was the VXO House,
and I like to show\nthis image because it
was a 1960s house of a client\nwho'd had a fire in the house.
And she called me\nup, and I knew her
from when I worked\nwith Ron Arad.
And she said, could you\ndesign me a new shelf?
And that was the\nshelf that she--
for her office that she\nwanted a new design for.
And it turned into\nthis project, which
is the VXO House, which was a\ncomplete renovation, extension
of the house.
So everything was gutted--
an extension to the front,\nadditional bedroom and foyer,
and then a gym and\nguest house here
where there was a garage\nbefore, and a carport over here.
And this project, in a\nway, launched my practice,
because, well, it's got an RIB\naward, and it was published.
And I treated this\nproject as I treat
all of my domestic projects,\nas a kind of essay,
a testing of ideas.
And in a way, this was my\npurest modernist experiment,
where I wanted to sort\nof really emphasize
the kind of '60s quality\nof the house with sort
of floating volumes and\nvery graphic structure.
Every element--\neven the front door
is a sort of object unto itself.
There is a huge\nwall that's actually
a wall drawing by\nSimon Patterson,
and you walk through a door\nin the wall to the cloakroom.
It's made of sort of\nautonomous pieces,
and each one is expressed\nas an individual thing.
And the idea was to\ncreate a kind of campus.
So it's like a domestic campus--
the house, which is the V,\nand then the X pavilion,
which is supported\nwith a sort of X
shaped structure replicating\nthe shape of a human body,
and then the O port, which is\na sort of impossible structure.
The load comes down via an\nO shaped piece of steel.
So it was a kind of\nlighthearted project,
but very serious\nat the same time.
I made the retaining\nwalls out of pebbles
to evoke sort of grottoes.
The roof was held off the walls\nso that it reads as a tray--
suspended staircase\nthat acts as a screen.
So each object had\nits own kind of role.
But after that\nproject, I felt I'd
kind of exhausted\nthat sort of essay,
and it was time to\ntry something new.
And this was a house extension\nin South London, where I sort
of took the opposite approach.
I wanted to make the whole\nextension out of one element.
And so this is the one element,\na three mil thick sheet
of brass.
And so by a series\nof cuts and folds,
the single sheet creates\ncolumns, sunshades, benches,
facades, roof, internal\nwalls finishes.
So this was, in a way,\ntrying to reduce architecture
to its absolute minimum--
just one piece, one element--
and to make it\nkind of disappear.
So I started working with\nmirror polished stainless steel
and lots of ways\nto create illusions
of thinness and lightness.
That sort of led to\nanother set of experiments
that had to do more with sort\nof manipulating that planar
quality and working\nin a sort of--
with geometry and in\nthe spirit of sort
of origami to create a sense of\nmovement and a dynamic quality
to facades.
And this is an\napartment building
in Accordia in Cambridge,\none three building typologies
I designed there.
And this is a kind of early\nsketch, which was just
an idea of how to make a kind\nof crystalline architecture
that sort of breaks\nthe rules of the sort
of orthogonal arrangement\nof point blocks
and becomes a kind of\napparition, something
very much about\nlight and reflection.
And this led to\nother experiments.
This is a house--
the Salt House in Maldon, Essex.
So this is a seaside\nhouse, and this
was a kind of hybrid\noyster fisherman's cottage
American beach house\nand atrium house.
And in a way, it\nwas the first time
I decided to work\nwith a pitched roof,
because I'd never\never considered
anything other than a flat\nroof throughout my education.
And I felt that I needed\nto embrace the idea of roof
as a form, as a\nsign, a signifier,
and to explore its geometry.
And by working with a hipped\nroof, it actually created--
it sort of had\nits own logic just
by sort of working with the\nperimeter of the building
to make the building\nand the whole thing
a sort of bay window\nto capture sea views.
That actually created a\nwhole series of effects
in terms of the\nelevations and the plants,
which have this very dynamic\norganic fluid quality
as a series of internal spaces.
And this idea of\nhybrids then migrated
to my first major\nhousing scheme,
which was in Newhall\nin north of London,
where I did a competition\nwith a developer
for 84 units of housing.
And my ambition,\nmy essay was how
to create suburban\nhousing that appears
as a kind of land art, that\nfeels totally tied to its place
and changes the sort\nof economy of suburbs.
And so the sort of\nhybridized typology
combines a sort of shopfront\nof a traditional sort
of Georgian house, the\ngeometries, and forms,
and materials of Essex\nbarns, the Miesian patio
house, and a kind of obsession\nwith Brancusi and his totems.
And this amalgamation\nresulted in a Newhall Be,
which was shortlisted for\nthe Stirling Prize in 2013.
And it's a series of\nhousing typologies.
I'm not going to\nshow all of them,
but these are\ncourtyard back to back
terrace houses, all of which\nhave workspace in the ground
floor.
So the idea was to\ntransform suburban housing
into work spaces where\npeople working at home
felt like they could\nparticipate in the street, even
have a sign.
Some people have signs\non their front window.
They're pre-fabricated timber.
They have 2.6 meter\nhigh ceilings.
A lot of them came\nwithout the roof adapted,
and you can expand into the\nroof after you buy your house.
So this was a kind of quite\nan experimental project that's
been hard to replicate\nsince, but it's
something that is used\nactually in the UK
as a kind of precedent for\nall suburban housing now.
Then I also did--
constantly doing competitions.
All of my work came\nvia competitions
until a couple of years ago.
This was for a seaside\ncity in the UK, Folkestone,
and they staged a competition\nfor a performing arts center--
220 seat flat\nfloor, multipurpose
performing arts center\nwith restaurant,
and cafe, and offices\non the top floor.
And I'm making long\nstories very short here,
but the idea for this\nwas to somehow draw
on the iconography\nof Folkestone itself,
the sort of seashell\nwindow surrounds
which are very typical in a lot\nof late Georgian architecture,
and the fact that\nscallops are actually
still fished in Folkestone--\nit is a fishing town.
And I wanted to sort of\nabstract this language,
this iconography to\nbecome a sort of veil,
and an expressive\nsort of enclosure
for the entire building,\nand also that it would glow
and reflect its sort\nof creative culture
by being a beacon for Folkestone\nand its creative communities.
And this building\nalso was about sort
of restoring a bit\nof streetscape.
This is a Georgian\nstreet that's going
through tough times\nin the past 150 years,
and so there was a gap there.
So this building is very\nmuch about completing
the streetscape and working\nwith a kind of very expressive
material that's both--
at the same time feels\ndelicate and fragile,
but is very robust.
It's expanded metal mesh,\nand this is the interior.
Very low budget building--
3.8 million pounds, which seems\nincredible in today's terms,
but it's a very hardworking\ncultural building.
And then other projects,\nlike the Lens House.
This is an extension, a\nconversion of a Georgian house
in Canonbury in London.
And again, it's\nthe kind of project
that you only have certain\nclients who allow you to do
things like this, but it was--
you can probably see--\na sort of iteration
of the fold house,\nthe brass house,
where I was trying to work\nwith a single sheet of material
that sort of through\na series of operations
becomes this folded\nfocusing space.
And this project is\nall about this tree.
Sort of all of these\nlenses or windows
focus on this huge walnut tree.
And this is the first example\nof corian used as a cladding.
So this is anthracite\nthrough colored corian,
which is amazing,\nbecause it doesn't age.
It stays looking\nabsolutely pristine.
And you can achieve--
this was my sort\nof pride and joy--
was this point here where\nabout eight or nine planes
all come together in one point.
And there's no flashing\nanywhere in this building.
There's no visible flashing.
So I've been sort of\nrefining these techniques
over many years of\ntrying to achieve
a kind of detail-less\nbuilding in a way.
And then this is a\nreally slow burn project.
It's actually still\nhappening right now.
It's more than 10\nyears I've been
working with this client\nin Gloucestershire.
He contacted me.
He and his wife had bought\nthis Victorian farmhouse, which
is here, that they want\ngutted and converted
into a kind of gallery\nfor their African art
and Indian tribal\nart collection.
And that became also\nan extended project
of 300 square meter house.
That would be the kind of real\ninhabited part of the project.
This is for guests.
It's all for art.
And then most recently, a pool\ncourtyard where the guest room
is sort of embedded\nin the garden
wall in a very simple kind\nof invisible architecture.
And so this project--
again, there are similarities to\nother domestic projects, where
it's working with an\nexisting structure.
This is a sort of early\nVictorian farmhouse.
We extended the back, used\nmirror polished stainless steel
to kind of be quite playful\nwith the idea of extending
and reflecting the\nlandscape, because planners
generally in the UK-- they\nwant any new work to disappear.
So you're always trying to make\nyour architecture invisible.
So here the mirror\npolished cladding
makes that extension\ninvisible, but on the bottom.
And then this is a\nkind of very low lying
extension-- huge\nextension that's
embedded in the landscape\nat the back of the house.
And this sort of\nsimplifies these diagrams,
the operation of sort\nof starting with what
was kind of a nine square grid\nwith a courtyard at the back,
a sort of light well,\nand then manipulating
the geometry of this to create\ncontained spaces, and views,
and bay windows,\nand then the roof
plane itself I manipulated\nto create a kind of landscape
because it does emerge out\nof a sort of rolling field.
And this kind of\ngeometry-- in the plan,
you can probably see\nechoes of the Salt House
and some of the other projects.
And again, it's an atrium house\nwith a kitchen at the center
and a kind of panopticon\nof views in all directions,
and this is a kind of journey.
The whole building and the way\nit connects to the landscape
is a narrative,\nwhat I sort of see
as a mixture of sort of\ncapturing views and creating
places for art.
And so these\nsections sort of show
how a very vertical\nVictorian farmhouse in a way
morphs into a very\nhorizontal set of spaces
with roof terraces, double\nheight volume over the living
room, very much trying to make\nthat kind of deep connection
to the landscape so\nyou can see through.
You can see right\nthrough the house
into the courtyard at the back--
and sort of manipulate in\na sort of origami-like way
facades so that solid, and\nvoid, and glazed, and unglazed
are blurred.
And this is the\nhouse from the back.
So this is the courtyard that's\ncut out of the landscape.
Some Corten steps up\nto the guest room.
So it, in a way,\ntries to reflect
the informality of its\ncontext and also contrast
with the existing architecture.
And this is the\nsort of conversion
of the Victorian house.
So I opened up\ntriple height spaces,
and it's become\na sort of display
for the clients' collection.
And then as you move\nthrough the building,
you can look down\nthrough internal windows
to look at his sculpture\nfrom different perspectives.
I mean, these photos are empty\nof all of the collection when
it was finished,\nbut every surface
is really conceived as a\nplace to display artifacts,
sculpture, art,\nand the staircase
is actually supported on\nthis steel grillage, which
is I call a display\nfor 100 objects
because there are 100\ncells in this wall.
And it's also the\nstructure for the stairs.
So the stair cantilevers\noff of that spine.
And then the pool\nhouse courtyard
is very subtle, very quiet,\nand there is just one
opening that you see into, which\nis the guest accommodation.
And the courtyard frames\nthese incredible views
to the landscape,\nand then there are
some sort of quiet\nplaces in the entrance.
So this project I suppose shows\nexploring different aspects
of--
you could call them\nobsessions over time,
sort of making homes for\npeople where they can display
their meaningful artifacts\nand live with them
in a very easy way, and\nalso connect very directly
to the landscape.
And these principles I bring\ninto my housing, as well--
my urban housing.
I am always trying\nto make every project
a sort of bespoke project\nfor whoever the client is.
So at the other end of the\nspectrum, around the same time,
I was doing competitions\nfor housing and regeneration
projects in London.
So this is Northwest London.
This is this area called\nSouth Kilburn, which
is just north of Notting Hill\nfor any of you who know London.
But I like to show\nthis image because it
shows how London was in 1938.
It was a kind of expression\nof a complete and perfect
Victorian city.
The Victorians were\namazing urban designers.
They don't really get\ntalked about very much,
but this neighborhood\nhad huge parks.
This is Paddington\nrecreation ground.
This is all mansion\nblocks and [inaudible]
terraced houses, avenues.
Kilburn Park Road, all sort of\nshops lining the major streets,
sort of interesting chevron\nshaped arrangements,
and triangular squares\nwith churches and terraces.
I mean, it was a kind of\ncomplete neighborhood.
And it was completely raised.
This was the sort of master plan\nfor this part of South Kilburn
in 1952, I think it was.
And so the idea was to destroy--
demolish all of the terrace\nhouses, and all of the streets,
and basically sprinkle slab\nblocks around in green space.
And actually, most of this\nwas built, but at the time,
a sort of local\nresidents association
decided to fight back, and\nthey prevented all of this
from happening.
And this is a\nconservationary, although this
was built, as well.
So the kind of amazing misguided\napproach to re-urbanization
still leaves its mark not only\nin London, but many cities all
over the world.
And this is actually an image\nof this part of the master plan
right here.
So this was supposed\nto be the town center,
and everything is boarded up.
The streets were\nall blocked off,
and this was supposed to be a\nsort of plaza for residents,
and there are these\nslab blocks replacing
what were terraced streets.
And I participated in a\ncompetition in, I think, 2010
to actually--
the local authority,\nBrent Council--
they sponsored-- most\nLondon municipalities
sponsor competitions\nand regeneration master
plans for their estates.
They're called failed states--\nbasically, your sink estates,
and which are generally\nsocial housing.
They're not a mixed community.
They're kind of low\nincome communities,
and there are a lot\nof problems in them
due to not only sort of\nsocial and income segregation,
but architectural segregation\nand kind of failed urban design
principles.
So you can see here how the\nsort of slab blocks that
were in that sort of 1952\nmaster plan are still here,
and then there's\nsort of green space
and then funny sort\nof low rise blocks.
And in a way, it looks\nfine because you think,
oh, there's all this green\nspace, and it's all kind of OK,
but this was a really, really\ndangerous neighborhood here.
And this I've just shown as\na kind of cultural divide
between the have nots\nand the haves who
occupy the sort of\nhistoric typologies.
And so this project\nfor Ely Court,
which I'm going to talk about up\nhere, is one of three projects
that I've worked on\nin South Kilburn.
All of them were competitions.
All of them were collaborating\nwith other architects.
So Lifschutz Davidson\ndid this piece up here,
and I did this piece, and then\nwe shared again on this site.
And then with Feilden\nClegg Bradley on that site.
And the local authorities\nreally appreciate that.
They don't want one\narchitect doing everything.
They don't want to repeat\nthe mistakes of the past
where you have a\nsort of monoculture--
architectural monoculture.
So my approach here was to--
in a way, very\nstraightforward-- to restore
the frontage to the street\nwith a terrace block here,
which is actually\na mansion block.
So these are duplexes\nwith entrances every three
flats and a little apartment\nbuilding down here,
another apartment,\nmews houses, and then
a piece here that\nsort of completes what
we call the flat iron block.
And the idea of this--
well, all of these-- was to\nkind of re-frame this piece
of neglected space to create\na public garden square where
all of the buildings around sort\nof have a role in overseeing
and sort of reactivating this\npiece of neglected space.
And this was formerly just a\nplace that you would never go,
because if you didn't live there\nin one of these slab blocks,
you would never go in there.
So the idea of introducing\na new street that
connects through to\nthe rest of the block
brings people going to\nschool, all sorts of movement,
and cars and traffic, which\nare good at a slow speed.
And these are the typologies--\nthe mansion block,
the flat iron, and\nthe mews block.
And so in a way, when\nyou see our project here,
it feels like it's\nnot very radical.
It's just kind of framing the\nspace of the street in the way
that the historic\nbuildings have always done,
but actually this is\nwhat these sites need.
They need a kind\nof normalization.
They need a direct relationship\nto the street with front doors,
with lots of windows, and\na kind of very clearly
defined public space.
And so, in a way,\nthe opportunity
for articulation and\ndetail in this project--
I mean, obviously it's\nthe local authority.
Not huge budgets for building\nthese projects, so the form
is very simple.
And all of the effort\nhas gone into sort
of articulating the common\nentrances for the flats above,
which are up here.
And these are two story houses--
duplexes that run right\nthrough from front to back.
And these porches, or verandas,\nare very natural to me.
Being North American,\nyou have to have a porch
on the front of a house.
And then recessed balconies\nso every place is sheltered.
And so you create\na depth-- this sort
of four meter depth\nto the facade that
gives shade, and shadow, and\nprivacy, shelter from the rain.
And people actually use them\nas rooms-- as outdoor rooms.
So much more useful spaces\nthan simple balconies.
And the porches also\nhide the rubbish bins,
which are behind those\nvertical elements.
So this project\nactually was shortlisted
for the Mies Van der Rohe\nAward a couple of years ago.
We lost out to NL Architects.
It was there Biljmermeer\nproject in Netherlands.
But for a sort of low income--
well, it's actually a\nmixed income project--
to sort of make it that\nfar is kind of amazing.
You can't tell the difference.
I'm not even going to tell\nyou which units are affordable
and which ones are private\nsale, because it doesn't matter.
They're all designed\nto the same standard.
So these are the mews houses.
So it's a mix--
40% social affordable\nhousing, and 60% private sale.
And then this image\nI think I really
enjoy because it shows how\nthe 1950s architecture, which
was actually quite\nambitious-- it was one
of the first examples\nof in situ concrete
framed buildings-- tall\nbuildings in London.
You can see the kind of\ncantilevered balconies
and concrete here.
There's a kind of\noptimism to that project,
but a failed approach\nto the ground floor,
and our building\nsort of mediates
between the historic context\nand the contemporary.
And then on our subsequent\nsite we actually went up
a scale in terms of density.
This is more sort of\na traditional mansion
block with six\nstories, and there's
[? cores ?] every two flats.
And again, French doors, high\nceilings, sheltered balconies,
all of the things that\nwe know from experience
provide really high\nquality living space.
And so this is how\nthe plan works.
It's a kind of ground scraper.
You can see there's no corridor.
There's a core with\na stair and a lift
and then three flats\narranged around the core.
So the idea is that people\ncan meet their neighbor,
and there's only three\npeople, and you don't
have to walk down a corridor.
Very high ceilings-- three meter\nhigh ceilings on the top floor,
and recessed balconies that\ncreate that outdoor room.
And then we have some\nother housing projects
sort of on the go.
This project was inspired\nby the Eagle pencil,
or the barrel pencil\nyou might know.
It's on the site of the\nBerol factory in London.
So it's in North\nLondon, Tottenham Hill,
and there was a big pencil\nfactory where the site is now.
So that's our site, and this\nis the sort of former context.
And this is just a\nvery quick summary
of what was also a competition.
This project is a sort\nof two week competition
where we were given a site,\na kind of massing envelope.
The Victoria line--\nthe tube line
runs straight\nunder the building,
so the volume had\nto be cut in two.
And then there's mains\nand sewers slicing off
another piece, and then we\nhad to get light into the site
and open it up to this cultural\neducation building behind us,
and then connecting it\nto its sort of context
and rationalizing the geometry.
And this is the final form.
And so these kind of exercises--
we sort of simplify them,\nbut in principle it's
how we have to work around both\nthe constraints of the site
and the unusual\ngeometries of the site.
But then in a way the\nidea of the building
to have a sort of rough\ntextured skin, which
is brick-- orange brick, and\nthen a silvery reflective
internal courtyard is,\nin a way, that idea
of the pencil with a contrasting\nskin to its internal mass.
And so we worked very hard.
These are sort of drawings\nthat we do for planning.
It just goes in to\nget planning consent.
It's nowhere near\ntendering or construction,
but you have to sort of\nguarantee the quality
that you want in\nthe final product
right at sort of\nrezoning planning stage.
And then this is all\nsort of leading up
to my biggest\nproject, I suppose,
which is in the Greenwich\npeninsula in London,
which was formerly just\nmarshland and a power station.
And this is a bit out of order.
This is in Cambridge,\nactually, north west Cambridge.
But this is the biggest\nproject in London,
which is in the\nGreenwich peninsula,
and here we were trying--\nit was a super high density
site, 600 dwellings\nper hectare, four
buildings on a single\nplot, and here we
were trying to evoke the\nspirit of the Victorian sort
of engineering around\nthe power station,
and create a sort of lattice\nand a continuous loggia
across the front of\nall of the buildings
to create that filtered space.
And here are some\nmodels that we produced.
And in a way, this\nimage sort of expresses
the language, a sort of\nlexicon of housing typologies.
And you can see the\ngeometries that we
work with have a lot to\ndo with either responding
to and mediating the context,\nwhich in London is usually very
organic in its geometry,\nbut sometimes we
work with very\nsort of pure ideas.
For example, this scheme, which\nis in Cambridge, where they're
very much like palazzos, we're\ndeveloping a sort of palazzo
topology as opposed to a bar\nor mansion block topology.
And I'll just diverge a bit\nto talk about the Smile.
This is basically showing the\nportfolio in a way of work
that led up to my 21\nyear party last year,
and anniversary and\npublication of a book.
But the Smile was obviously a\nreally fantastic project for us
in terms of really, in a\nway, responding to a brief,
which was to just\ndesign anything,
like a public building that\nwould somehow celebrate design
in London using 72 cubic\nmeters of tulip wood.
That was the brief.
So it was two container\nloads of tulip wood,
which was being donated by\nthe American Hardwood Export
Council.
So this project I really\nwanted to kind of make timber
do something it had never done\nbefore, which is cantilever.
That's a huge cantilever.
The longest that's ever\nbeen done in timber.
It's 14 meters on either\nside of the center point--
and to create a kind of\npavilion that doesn't really
look like architecture,\nbut that would
attract people to experience\nit as architecture.
And so it's also very--
it was a very\nimmersive installation.
When you went inside,\nit was obviously
a very focusing experience.
One end of the sort of\ncurved tunnel, I suppose,
focused on the\nEdwardian architecture
of Chelsea College of\nArt, and the other end
focused on a very\nbeautiful tree.
And we worked very hard\nwith our engineers, Arup,
to make this happen.
We perforated it on\nthe ends to allow
sort of expression of\nthe structural forces,
because they're the\nleast in this area.
So each hole was very\nprecisely located,
and there's a cradle under there\nwith 20 tons of lead weights
because we couldn't\ndig foundations.
And there's an archaeological\nsite under this arc,
and so we had to use a\ncounterweight system.
And then at night, it's--
I suppose this image\nis the closest to what
was my first intention for the\nproject-- was that it would
feel like an infinite space.
So when you're standing\nat the top of the arc,
you can't see where it ends.
So it actually takes you into\nsort of another dimension,
but it's made of 12 huge panels\nof cross laminated tulip wood.
And it was a kind of\nincredibly popular thing.
It got photographed about a\nmillion times on Instagram.
Everybody really had fun\nwith the photography,
and it was a really well\nloved installation in London,
and also a very\nimportant experiment
in terms of timber engineering.
And then finally the\nCohen Quad in Oxford,
which I sort of wanted to\ncelebrate this with my 21 year
party because it was\nactually at this point
when it was finished\nthat we decided
to stage a major\nexhibition at Somerset
House, my favorite\nbuilding in London.
And this is the\nembankment gallery space,
and we made a video, a\nfilm of practice's work,
and staged our models\nthroughout the space.
This is Somerset House.
This is not my party.
[laughter]
It would have been nice.
Maybe next time-- 30 year\nparty will look like that.
But Somerset House just\nhas this amazing capacity
to take on cultural\nevents of every type,
and one of the most\ninteresting things
is that downstairs it's\ngot two levels of basements
that you can sort of see\ninto from here up in the air.
And now the Courtauld Institute\nhas Makerversity there.
So it's a university,\nstudio spaces for makers.
So there's all\nsorts of production
happening in the basement\nlevels of Somerset House.
So here's some more images.
So we showed all our\nprocessed models and our sort
of final model sort of in\nthe spirit of Christopher
Wren of our Cohen\nQuad in Oxford,
and models of this project,\nwhich is nearly finished
in Belsize Park in\nLondon, which, again,
is another experiment\nin planar geometry,
then meshing and\nbay windows having
to sort of respond to\nthis kind of architecture
and get planning\nconsent in London,
which is very difficult.
So my 21 year anniversary\ngave me the incentive, also,
to publish a book,\nIdeals and Ideas, where
I felt that it was\nreally important to state
the kind of values\nbehind my work.
And there's an\nessay in there where
I describe these four ideals\nas authenticity, generosity,
civicness, and beauty.
And I really felt it's\nimportant that I actually
use the word beauty, which\nis also something that's
been sort of rejected since\nthe early modern movement, sort
of discussions of aesthetics\nand what constitutes beauty,
but beauty is generally what\neverybody wants in their life,
as well as civicness, and\ngenerosity, and authenticity.
And so this kind of declaration\nof a value system I felt
was important in\nstarting a discussion
and also to kind of change\nthe perspective of clients.
In a way, society at\nlarge doesn't expect this
from architects,\nand I think it's
important we reclaim\nthis territory.
And in the book, I sort\nof describe my work
according to these themes,\nthese sort of techniques,
or tactics, or themes that\nactually have influenced
most of-- well, all of my work.
But I I've actually decided to\ntalk about this word models,
and name this talk Model\nBuilding because I think
the word models is, in a way,\nmore instrumental than the word
ideals.
I'm really interested\nin language
and the way we articulate\narchitectural ideas with words,
and we use the word model\na lot, but we use it
very loosely and in\nmany different ways
that I think a lot of\npeople don't relate
to outside of the profession.
And so how do we combine this\nidea of ideals and models?
What does it mean?
And of course there's one way\nof using the word models, which
is building models, typological\nmodels, theoretical models,
conceptual,\ninstitutional, and urban.
And we all sort of know\nwhat we mean by those--
that they're sort of exemplar,\nand they're sort of ideal.
But in the other way, we can\nexpress the word model even
in a way emphasizing\nthat quality that applies
not only to objects such\nas houses, but also people.
So model family, model\ncommunity, model organization.
And in a way, this idea\nof model society I think
is what we're in a way--
the expectation\nis that someday we
will achieve a model society,\nbut what is that model society,
and how does architecture\ncontribute to that
and allow many different kinds\nof models and model scenarios
to exist and to co-exist.
So this idea of\nmodel building I felt
was really important to\ndiscuss and sort of articulate.
In the context of my\nproject in Oxford,
which was a competition I\nwon in 2011 for the new Cohen
Quad in Oxford--
and this is a kind\nof model community.
Oxford colleges-- I am not sure\nif they're exactly the same
here at Harvard, but\nOxford is made up
of colleges, which are\nactual communities.
They are autonomous,\nindependent communities,
and not only is Oxford--
its sort of pedagogical\nmodel based on colleges,
but it's architectural\nmodel and morphology
is based on colleges,\nwhich are quadrangles.
And so each one of these\nquads represents a college,
and that college is a community\nmade of fellows, and students,
and staff, who live, and\nteach, and learn in the quad.
And this model comes from\nthe monastic tradition.
They were started\nas monasteries that
then became secular and now\nform the kind of college model
that we all know and love.
And so when I was shortlisted\nfor this competition, of course
I did a lot of research\ninto the history of Exeter
College, its quads, and the\namazing kind of roof line
and amalgamation of\ndifferent periods
and styles of\narchitecture, but framing
a collective space and the\nvery thin buildings that
were accessed by stairs--
one stair per sort of community,\nin a way serving two rooms.
And Exeter College is\nthis bit right here.
So it's an amazing 700 year\nold campus with beautiful
Neo-Gothic chapel and gardens--
fellows gardens,\nfront quad, back quad.
And then all of these\nare other colleges--
Jesus College, John's College,\nTrinity College, et cetera.
And this typology always is\nabout framing a space, a sort
of collective outdoor space.
And the nature of Exeter College\nand Turl Street is very much
about these framing spaces,\nbut then jewel buildings--
this incredible jewel\nbuilding, which is 1865--
George Gilbert\nScott-- basically one
of the most beautiful examples\nof Neo-Gothic architecture
in the UK.
And this kind of\nlegacy is something
that you have to sort\nof take on board when
you work for an Oxford college.
So when we won the\ncompetition, the idea
was that it would be\nfinished for their 700 year
anniversary, which was in 2014,\nwhich was going to be difficult
since that was 2011.
So we only had four years,\nand this is the site up here
in the top left hand corner.
So basically all of the land\nin Central Oxford is gone.
It's taken, and this\none site came up,
which was the site of a\nformer Ruskin College.
And all of the colleges\nwere bidding for it,
but Exeter College got\nit, which was very lucky.
And we were given\na project brief,
and really the project\nbrief was to reinvent
the collegiate ideal\nfor the 21st century.
That was the kind of\nsummary statement.
And you can see it includes\nmany, many different kinds
of uses, living\nand study spaces,
study bedrooms, fellows studies,\nfellows sets, where they teach
large seminar rooms, small\nseminar rooms, auditorium
learning commons, archive common\nrooms, cafe, kitchens, offices,
courtyards, porter's\nlodge, sort of everything.
It's like a sort of\ncampus in a building.
And the site was--
there was a historic building\nat the front of the site, which
was the former Ruskin College,\nand this kind of legacy
is sort of something you always\ncome up against in the UK.
Ruskin College--\nwell, the building
was named after John\nRuskin, and John Ruskin
was a tutor of William\nMorris, and William Morris is
an alumnus of Exeter College.
And the kind of\ninterconnectedness
of great cultural figures\nand philosophers-- this
is very deep.
And also Ruskin College was\na working man's college,
where some of the first sort\nof social justice movements
happened in the UK.
So although the idea--
or the project was to tear down\nthe building in its entirety,
this sort of historic building\nand a bunch of accretions
along the back, we had to retain\nthe facade of the existing
building, but all of this was\nbasically unusable legacy.
And this was the set\nof diagrams that we
produced at the sort\nof second stage of--
actually the first\nstage of the competition
where you had to put your\nconcepts on one A4 page--
a sort of approach.
And we did some very\nsimple section diagrams
in this series of\nsort of figure ground
plans to illustrate\nin a way our capacity
to consider many, many\ndifferent typologies in terms
of how we approached the\nsite for the next stage.
And what we ended up\ndoing is something
like this, which this was\nwhat was there on the site
more or less existing.
And we sort of\ntook that diagram,
and rotated it in the\nmiddle, and sort of
created an entirely new space\nat the middle of the building.
And it became what we\ncall the S-shaped quad.
So this gesture actually\nsort of transformed
the potential of the site.
So one garden quad facing\nsouth, another one facing north,
and this space in the\nmiddle of the project
became something that wasn't\neven in the competition brief.
That became central\nto the project.
And so I think there's\na series of slides here.
Well, anyway, the site\nplan became this S,
and you can see this\nsouth facing courtyard
and a north facing\ncourtyard, and then
this sort of transitional\npiece in the middle.
And what this meant was\nwe could create the space,
which we call the\nlearning commons, which
is the social learning space\nin the heart of building.
So the sort of entrance--
the idea of the\njourney that you would
enter the building\nthrough a historic facade,
go into a 21st century\ncontext, and be
led in a route through\nto this learning space,
and to a sort of jewel building\nat the end of the journey.
It was also a three\ndimensional concept
because the site slopes.
So this would be a\nmulti-level space,
and it would be for part of what\nwe called a continuous three
dimensional ambulatory.
And so to develop this idea\nof a root and a narrative,
obviously passages and\ncorridors are important,
and we try never\nto have corridors.
We try to make all spaces\ninto habitable places.
And so this concept\nfor the cloisters,
which are the passages\nthrough the building,
were based on the idea\nof a convex ellipse.
So these series of timber\nribs form and describe
the space of a convex ellipse.
So we could create spaces to\ndwell at the center, and then
a second cloister, which\nis made in concrete,
and that forms the space\nof a concave ellipse.
And so these two\ncloisters connect
the ends of the building and\nlead to the central learning
common space and connect to\nthe auditorium at the end.
And this was our\ncompetition image,
starting to sort of describe\nthe materials we hoped to use.
And here, you can see this sort\nof final plan-- so the idea
of the entrance, the journey,\npast the teaching rooms,
and amphitheater,\nthe learning commons
in the middle, another\nset of teaching rooms,
cloister, and auditorium.
And this kind of continuity\nbetween inside and outside,
and this kind of central\nspace in the building
was its driving sort\nof plan, organization.
And then this is an image--\nsort of while we were modeling
in the competition stage--
the idea of actually making\nthe roof of a single sheet
of metal, which is cut, and\nfolded, and sort of tailored
to a series of\nstepped volumes that
allow the building to respond\nto the scale of the street
from the institutional\ndown to the domestic.
And so these folded wrapping\nplanes actually do two things.
They express the new\nsort of community
of students in the\nbuilding, and they
allowed us to really add another\ntwo stories onto the building
disguised by this\nsort of mansard roof,
and to create new\nkinds of spaces
under those curved roofs.
So it was a kind of\ntailoring of curved planes
to fit the building,\nand you get these sort
of automatic, interesting\ndormer windows
that cut through\nthose curved planes.
And so the building is like\nus six slash seven story
building that reads as\na three story building.
These floors are the\nsort of work horse
of the building-- are the\nstudio room floors with family
kitchens, windows at\nthe end of the corridors
so that no space\nfeels like a corridor,
teaching rooms on the\ntop floor, and lots
and lots of different\nactivities and functions
throughout the building.
And in a way, the expressive\ncapacity of this project
is really symbolized\nby the roof,
and we wanted to, in a way,\nrefer to the arts and crafts
tradition of Jericho,\nthe neighborhood,
the sort of medieval Neo-Gothic\npatterning of the chapel.
And we were inspired\nby this lead work
on the spire of the\nchapel, and that
became our sort of\npoint of reference
in terms of the\niconography of the project
and the expression of the roof.
So the metal-- it's actually\nstainless steel shingles,
and I'll talk about\nthem more in a minute.
And so this is how it\nsort of all comes together
in a very simple diagram--
the retained facade, the\nkind of stone plinth,
the timber cloisters, the\nstudent rooms, and then
the all enveloping roof.
Two years of planning,\nconsultations--
we had to write a book.
This is a book\ncalled The History
of the Evolution\nof Roofs in Oxford,
and we had to do that\nto convince the planners
that our curved roof\nhad a kind of lineage
within the sort of\ntradition of Oxford
from the 11th century\nNorman cathedrals
to contemporary times.
And this is a list of the\nstakeholder consultations.
You can see they went\nover a three year period--
2011, 2014 consent.
And then this is a kind of\nwhiz through the construction
sequence-- so piling,\nretained facade,
concrete frame going up, and\nthe steel frame for the roofs.
The glue lamps for the\nauditorium being erected.
And then these columns\nactually hold the beams
so it's a column-free space.
And that's the auditorium under\nconstruction-- the cloister.
The stainless steel shingles\nwere actually made in Enfield
in the very last metal\nworkshop left in London where
they oxidize stainless steel.
And so we had to achieve a\nvery special pattern that
prevented too much reflection.
And so we made one to one\nmock ups of different scales
and sizes of shingles to\nensure that they didn't heat up
the neighborhood, because\nsome people were complaining
to the college that these\nstainless steel roof
tiles would actually change\nthe climate in Jericho,
and so we had to prove to them\nthat that wouldn't happen.
But another important\nthing about this project,
and, in the way, the roof\nand using these shingles
was to use metal crafts\npeople to actually make
the building in the spirit of\nWilliam Morris and the arts
and crafts.
And they were amazing--
the team that put the\nroof singles on-- there
are so many of them.
And it really is a\nskill, and an art,
and something we\nwanted to celebrate.
So this is how the\nbuilding appears.
It's very subtle.
You don't notice it\nif you don't look up
when you're walking\ndown the street,
but this is our sort\nof two story extension
to the roof of this sort of\nEdwardian Baroque facade,
behind which is sort of\nconcealed a series of volumes.
This is obviously still\nunder construction.
And in a way, the\nexperience, the surprise
of going through\nthat historic facade
and coming into the\nbuilding was something
that is, in a way, a part\nof the story of the college
and of the site that\nwe think is valuable.
So this is the porter's lodge.
So in that entry\nhall space, you are
drawn into the south\ncloister, and you
can see the south quad\nstaircase on the left.
Pigeon holes made of brass, my\nlittle tribute to Donald Judd.
If he ever made a pigeon\nholes wall for a college,
I thought that's how\nthat might happen.
So the idea is to\ninvite students
to use the stairs by making\nthem warm and friendly places.
All of the signage and\nhandrails are in brass.
These emulate a book\nwith its leaves open.
And the south cloister has--
it's glazed, and so it has a\nsort of constantly changing
quality of light\nthroughout the day,
depending on the leaves moving.
And then the north\ncloister is concrete,
so it has a completely\ndifferent quality,
and it faces north--\ncompletely different light.
And between the cloister arches\nyou can see into study rooms.
And then some of the\nbig seminar rooms
are behind the retained\nfacade, and they reflect--
well, these are retained\nhistoric windows,
but then other spaces are\nentirely contemporary.
This is the learning commons.
So in this social\nlearning space--
Oxford's first social\nlearning space--
you can be in enclosed\nrooms, lower mezzanines that
are semi open.
You can go down to\nthe cafe so that you
can see the street\nbeyond so you're
kind of connected\nto the context,
and then looking in the\nother direction this
is the south quad and Worcester\nCollege beyond cafe down below.
It's just a quiet sitting area.
So the whole space is\nvery fluid and very open,
and students kind\nof study in the cafe
or wherever they\nfeel comfortable
throughout the learning commons.
It's used also for parties\nand club nights down here.
And then all of our\ncorridors are study areas,
and this is the north quad.
So in the internal rooms,\nyou can see through the quad
into the courtyard.
And this is the foyer, the\nbox office for the auditorium,
and here is a\nWilliam Morris rug.
So this is part of the\ncollege's collection.
It's the only four\nmeter by four meter
wall in the whole building,\nand it fit exactly
the William Morris rug, which\nis a very nice coincidence.
And then this is the auditorium\nroof kind of emerging.
And it was-- the\nidea here is to pull
the light from the south sort\nof across the roof, and down
and into the space\nof the auditorium
because this is on the\nnorth side of the building.
So these plates actually connect\nthe sort of wishbone columns
to the roof.
These were made in\nthe Netherlands,
and this is the auditorium.
The staircases-- so\ngoing up the stairs
you can see into\ncourtyards, or you can
see into the learning commons.
All of the wood is cherry.
It's a kind of personal\nobsession I have.
I love cherry wood,\nand it takes me back
to North America,\nAmerican cherry.
I think it's a kind of\nquintessential wood.
And these are the corridors\nup on the student floors.
And back down in the\ncafe again the archive,
and these are\nstained glass windows
that we put in to the corridor\nadjacent to the archive,
and they're William Morris\nstained glass windows.
These are family Kitchens on\nevery floor for the students
to study.
These are student rooms that\nare under the curved roof,
so exposed concrete walls\nand big curved ceilings,
if you're lucky enough to\nget one of those rooms.
I don't know what's\nhappened there.
I'll keep going.
That's a fellow's study.
So these are the\nteaching sets up
on the third floor\nwhere professors have
their permanent\nstudies, and they
teach students in little\ngroups of four or five.
And this is a study\nfacing Worcester College.
So this project,\nI think, in a way,
is the culmination of a lot\nof, in a way, the aspirations
that any architect would want\nto deliver for a client--
a sort of long term\nclient who wants
to invest in a future\ncommunity and a kind
of architectural topology\nthat supports that community.
And actually, this brings sort\nof new expression to Oxford,
to its roof line.
It's not about spires and sort\nof ecclesiastical architecture.
It's about a community\nand a kind of embracing
language of form and material.
That, in a way, has opened\nup a lot of new possibilities
in Oxford.
Apparently there are quite\na lot of new projects
that are happening\nthat have curved
roofs, which haven't really been\nsince Wren did the Sheldonian.
And so it's been a sort of\nreally satisfying process.
It's about to open, be launched\nto the public in a few months.
These things do take\na long time to open,
and this is our sort\nof piece of Oxford quad
that's open on two sides\nrather than enclosed.
Now, I have another\nproject that is, in a way--
I'm just going to whiz through\ntill I get to the Biennale,
because, in a way, the\nculmination of this talk
is talking about the Venice\nArchitecture Biennale.
And it actually-- my\ninstallation there
sort of includes and\nincorporates elements
from Exeter College and from\nmy residential projects.
And King's Cross is a really\nimportant project in London
because it's one of its\nbiggest regeneration sites
and one of its most important.
And so we won a\ncompetition for this site
here up at the top of\nthe main axial park.
This is King's\nCross, and this is
the canal that runs through it.
It's former rail lands,\nuniversity of arts,
and this is the central park.
Thomas Heatherwick's\ndoing this piece here,
and lots of other architects\nare doing interesting parts
around the master plan.
And it's one of\nthe best examples
of landscape, a really great\npublic realm in landscape
design in London.
This huge amphitheater\ngoing down to the canal--
that's Central Saint Martins.
This is a new building.
That's just a pub.
It's just been built as\na pub and nothing else,
which is incredible.
And in our project,\nI really wanted
to sort of draw on the spirit\nof King's Cross, and its sort
of landmark historic buildings\nlike King's Cross Station
itself and the tradition of\nreally fantastic expressive
arches that express the\ntechnology of railway sheds
at the turn of the century.
And so we had this another\nsort of very awkward site
with five sides with tube\nlines running underneath it
that we had to sort of carve and\nexcavate to create a courtyard
building, and, in\na way, this project
is another example of sort\nof working with a geometry
and with a language of sort of\ndiversity of height and scale,
and sort of creating\nour own skyline,
and bringing it all together\nwith a continuous arch
colonnade at its base.
And most projects in\nLondon-- and King's Cross
in particular--
embed a lot of different\nuses at the ground floor--
lots of entrances.
It's all about mixing it up.
This is our ground floor plan--
very, very tight plan--
a reflecting pond\nat the center, and
different commercial\nand office work spaces
around the perimeter.
And we spend a\nlot of time making
our plans work very hard.
It's very difficult\nto get the efficiency,
and all of the flats\nhave to be minimum sizes,
but we really push for\nvolume and ceiling height.
And this image is from\nour competition scheme,
so a sort of slender totem\nat the top of the park,
and it's all about\nbringing sort of a building
with no front and no back--
that it acts as a threshold that\ninvites people to actually move
around its base and use its\nspaces in different ways.
Some of these are office\nspaces, and it actually
has different readings.
Also, it has a small public\nsquare to the northwest.
So the volumes kind of\nmodify as it rotates around.
And so this project--
in a way, it's also been\na highly technical project
in terms of working out\nthe language and tectonics
of arches, which is something\nwe've lost, I think,
in the last 100 years.
We really haven't done\narches much, and so,
as a good modernists,\nwe're sort of learning.
We've tested many,\nmany different kinds.
Sorry, this is all\ngone really moire--
are sort of tests of brick\nvoussoirs and bezier arches
in getting the\ngeometries to work.
And our arches actually\nare all different sizes
because they're actually\nexpressing the structure.
Obviously columns\nare coming down here,
and so our arches are actually\non an in situ concrete frame,
as old buildings have been\nsince the mid 19th century,
but actually have\narticulated arches.
And so these are sort\nof exploratory renders.
It has gone in for planning.
It's imminent that it\ngoes in for planning.
This is the courtyard space,\nand probably this project
is the closest\nI've been to trying
to evoke the spirit\nof, in a way, Rome,
and Hadrian's villa, and\nsome of the major influences
that I had as a student in Rome,\nbecause Waterloo students spend
their fourth year in Rome.
And this is the sort of crown of\nthe building, and this project,
and our other ones are the\nsort of main protagonists
of our installation for\nthe Venice Biennale.
So we were invited last\nautumn by Grafton architects
to participate in the free\nspace Venice Biennale, which
is on at the moment until\nthe end of November.
And this is a kind\nof funny image.
It's a sort of reverse image\nof the Corderie in Venice
and the space that\nwe were allocated,
which is here in the first room,\nand our sort of installation,
how it ended up appearing\nthere, but it was
kind of a two stage process.
The Graftons first,\nagain, asked us
to put on a single A4\npage what our concept
for our installation would be.
And so this was our concept--
to create a plinth from\nwhich four totems emerge.
And each one of these\ntotems, or spaces,
or columns, that\nshow in section here
represent a different quality\nof free space in housing.
They asked me to actually\naddress the subject of housing
somehow within the\ntheme of free space.
And so the idea was that each\none of these columns of totems
would create an\nexperience of free space,
but we hadn't really\ndecided how we were
going to do this at this point.
It was all very quick.
And so that concept of a sort\nof plinth with four totems, each
representing a\ndifferent quality,
became articulated in\nour final proposal,
which we called\nrecasting, where we
recast four qualities of\nfree space in our housing
as very particular\nelements, creating
an immersive experience.
And so in a way, the arches\nfrom the King's Cross projects
were abstracted as an arch\nrepresenting threshold.
This space represents\na roof space
that we often work with\nwith dormers, and roofs,
and faceted geometries\nto create very particular
spatial qualities in roofs.
This is actually the\ncloister from the Cohen
Quad turned on its end and\nrecreated at about 1/10 scale.
So you lie down in\nhere, and you look up,
and you get an illusion of\nthe cloisters from Cohen Quad.
And this is a sort of replica\nof our Accordia project.
The quality is inhabited\nedges and the way
we manipulate geometry to make\nthe edges of buildings places
to inhabit.
And the central\nspace reflects a kind
of civic space,\na gathering space
that the amphitheater feeds.
So this was our sort\nof first render.
The idea was to\nmake everything out
of plywood, which actually\ncreates certain limitations
in terms of how you build it,\nbut one of the most interesting
processes was how to create\nthis arch, our sort bezier arch,
and to dematerialize something\nthat you would expect to be
very solid, which is an arch.
And these are the\nsort of renders
we did of the experiences\nof the four totems.
So the threshold\ntotem with mirrors
on each side of\nits internal arch
creates an infinite colonnade.
The roof space totem,\nagain, with angled mirrors,
and sloped walls, and a bench\ncreates an infinite crescent
of roof space.
And this is the image of\nthe cloister that you see.
There's a mirror at the\nend at a very slight angle
so you get this sort of doubled\nimpression of the cloister.
And this is looking up into\nthe inhabited edges totem
them that, in a way,\nechoes or Accordia project.
So these are pictures\ntaken at the Biennale.
There's a very long image on\nthe wall of the Corderie and all
of the architects working\nthere, some of whom
teach here at the GSD.
And we were very happy to\nbe here right at the front,
and the next image\nis actually a video
where I will take you through\nsort of the last image--
the process of\nmaking, recasting,
where we've, in a way, made\nan ideal model of the models
that we build in\nour architecture.
I should say that my\nproject architect,
who I worked with on recasting,\nand who made this video
and built the projects,\nis Ceri Edmunds, who
actually is a GSD graduate.
Some of you might remember him.
He's been working with\nme for a long time.
This is the studios\nof Benchmark,
who have their workshop\noutside of Oxford,
and they're the most\nincredible craftsmen ever.
They 3D modeled\nevery little piece.
Even from our 3D model,\nthey modeled every element
of the project and also designed\nits packing, and its shipping,
and the components.
And they were amazing.
And all of the material was\ndonated by a Spanish plywood
company.
It'll come to me in a minute.
This was really tricky,\ninstalling these pieces.
They were very big,\nand the connections--
all the connecting pieces\nwere really hard to get at,
and we had to\ndisguise everything
and concealed all\nthe connections.
And you can see the\ndouble layer of arch,
that second set of\nshims in the arch
is actually the structure\nthat's preventing
the thrust from actually\nmaking the arch collapse.
So there's an inner\narch and an outer arch.
So I suppose this is also\nquite a contextual project
because we designed it so\nthat it would culminate
in that window of the Corderie.
It isn't a coincidence\nthat the window
is at the top of\nthe amphitheater,
and we also wanted it to act\nas a stage and a resting place
for people going through\nthe Biennale, and for people
to sort of watch the\nadjacent exhibition,
because there was a video\ninstallation next door.
So it was really meant to be a\nplace where people could sort
of hang out, and\nspend time, and act
as that sort of framed, shared,\nstage for a kind of simulacrum
of civic life.
The plywoods-- the\nmanufacture is called Garnica.
I knew it was going\nto come to me.
And it's poplar plywood,\nso it's super lightweight,
and it grows very fast, so it's\nreally, really sustainable.
And one of the reasons\nwe could use it
is because of its light weight,\nbecause there are strict weight
requirements in the Biennale.
This is you get a bit of a\nsurprise when you walk in the--
well, in all of them.
There's a surprise\nin all of the totems.
So I'm going to end\non these photos.
I really like these because\nit's a really good sign when
children and babies\nlike your architecture,
and this was really,\nreally fun to see
these kids enjoying ReCasting.
And then the kind of\nfinal stamp of approval
came from Peter Cook and Al Cook\nenjoying the roof space totem.
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
[applause]
[inaudible] a couple questions.
[inaudible]
So I think we only--
first of all, thank you, Alison,\nfor our wonderful lecture.
I think we only have time\nfor a couple of questions.
But if they're yes or no\nquestions, we could take more.
I think someone will\nbring the mic to you.
Thank you very much.
What have been some of your\nmost fruitful collaborations
with engineers, and\nwhat characterizes them?
We really enjoyed\nworking with Arup.
When you work with\nspecialist teams,
you kind of get\nextra enthusiasm.
Andrew Lawrence, who runs\nthe timber group at Arup
is just so passionate\nabout timber engineering,
and he knows\neverything about it.
And that's been really,\nreally successful.
We work with a lot of\ndifferent engineers,
but I would say the\nbest experiences are
when they actually come up\nwith ideas during meetings,
rather than sort of waiting\nfor the design to be finished.
There's a kind of\ncondition in practice
where consultants\nsay don't contact us
until the project is frozen--
the design is frozen.
Then we'll do our engineering.
And that's really\nfrustrating, because you
want more of a dialogue\nduring the process.
I mean, I've worked with one\nengineer, David [? akira, ?]
for most of my house projects,\nand he's just amazing
because he makes\nimpossible things happen.
I've used a lot of steel\nin the houses I've done,
as well as timber.
They're normally\nhybrid projects.
I mean, for this\nproject and the Smile,
it was really, really hard,\nboth of those projects,
both for the engineers\nand just the logistics
of the whole thing.
And it had happened so\nquickly, but that idea
of having that second arch\nring, which it acts as spacers,
but it also stops the arch-- the\nforces from exploding outwards.
That was a really nice thing\nthat happened that was--
it was purely the engineer\nwho said that, and we never--
we were just kept hoping that\nall of the compression forces
would be taken up in the inner\narch, and that would be fine,
and then it was\nimpossible because we
had nothing around it.
So I don't know.
There has to be a kind of\nopenness and willingness
to just try things that\njust seem impossible
when you first start.
No other questions?
I'll ask a question.
I wonder if you could\ntalk a little bit more
about the model, the\nmodel as an exemplar.
I mean, I think the\nwork is incredible,
and you talked about\nevery project being
bespoke and very specific--\nsite and context specific.
But over the years,\nthere are also
certain tendencies\nthat begins to continue
through the projects.
And I'm also wondering\nif in the urban scale--
a lot of your projects\nare in London and the UK,
but now you're\nworking in Canada.
Now you're working in Moscow.
Are there certain things\nthat begin to carry over?
I think of the model in the\n[inaudible] sense, the model
where everything comes through.
There are some\nmoments where I could
begin to detect that, and\neven in the Venice Biennale
installation, like when you\ntalk about the [? presage, ?]
the roofscape, the\nthreshold, and I
wonder if these kind of\narchitectural moments
are the equivalent to the\nurban artifact for you
that are your\nlanguage that begins
to transcend the specific\ncontext of your projects
or locales.
Yeah, I think there are\ncertain devices, I suppose--
architectural\ndevices that I think
are sort of essential\nin conveying, I suppose,
these ideals of generosity,\nfor example, of civicness,
of authenticity,\nall of these things.
I mean, authenticity is a\nlittle bit too general a word.
I think in terms of\ngenerosity the free space
theme of this year's Biennale\nwas really appropriate,
because it's\nsomething that I fight
for in all of my projects,\nespecially in housing.
You have to really work very\nhard to build in generosity.
You have to kind of sneak\nit in to projects really.
And those are the\nplaces that people
love the most, those\nplaces that are just
a little bit unexpected\nand out of the ordinary.
And I suppose there's\nsort of ideas of--
sometimes I call it\nplasticity, that if you
work with architectural matter\nin a subtractive way rather
than additive, you kind of\nembed those spatial and formal
qualities in your\narchitecture in a way that's
more permanent and\nmore legible than sort
of adding things in layers.
I think you know what I mean.
I mean, your work, I\nthink, does similar things
in that you kind of work\nwith the fundamental body
of the building,\nand it takes a sort
of commitment in\nterms of geometry
and the sort of effects\nthat you produce.
I'm not sure if I'm\nanswering the question,
but there are definitely\nrecurring themes,
and I think every project in\na way has to serve as a model,
like a kind of model project.
Sometimes I say you have to\ntreat every project like it's
your last.
It has to be like the\nabsolute best possible thing
because it might be the\nlast building you do.
So I don't have\nprojects that are
sort of like backroom projects\nand then A-list project.
Every project has to\nbe an A-list project.
And I think that\ninvestment is worth it.
Maybe it means-- well,\nI think I deliberately
haven't grown as a practice\nwhen I could have become
bigger than like 30 or 40,\nbecause I turn down projects
where I don't think there's\nan opportunity to be
able to stand by my values.
And so I suppose that\ncapacity for architects
to say no to clients who aren't\nalso sharing your values system
is really important, and I think\nit's the only way that we're
going to shift\nthe ground, shift,
in a way, how we are\nperceived in terms
of our value, our cultural\nvalue, and our political value,
and our social value.
It's all about our\nwork and in a way
the model scenarios we\ncreate with our work.
Hi, first of all,\nthank you very much.
The work is mesmerizing.
The question I have.
I'm sure you're familiar\nwith the tiny homes movement.
So that's where you have\nabout 20 square meters
or so to work with.
How would your ideas apply in\nthat sort of miniature context,
or do you have to\nevolve your ideas
or change them in some way?
And second part of\nthat, have you had
to design something like that?
Thank you.
Thank you.
I've kind of avoided those\nprojects, to be honest.
I just think it's\nvery difficult to work
on sort of micro accommodation\nthat isn't a sort of--
this is going to\nsound quite tough.
It's very easily commoditized.
It's a kind of stepping\nstone to your sort
of real home or your real life.
And I kind of feel like a\nlot of things that are--
they're called products that\nare being put out on the market.
I really hate that term--
housing, places where\npeople live as products.
I think that our\nenergy should be
going into creating places\nwhere people can move and live
their life in that\nplace, and not
have to move three or\nfour times every time
you have to scale up.
And if more energy was\ndevoted to building actually
the kinds of dwellings,\nlike whether they can still
be apartments and flats, and\nmultistory, and high density,
but they should be\nplaces where people
feel they can have a social\nlife, and live for years,
and have things.
And I know there's a kind\nof changing scenario where--
co-living and all\nof that stuff where
you have a sort of\ntiny flat, and then you
share living, and eating,\nand leisure spaces.
And I think there\nis a place for that,
but I mean, you need lots and\nlots of different solutions,
but I think building is such a\ncomplex and expensive process
that the energy\nthat we have to put
into making urban buildings,\nmaking homes, making
those things--
I think we have to go for more\ngenerosity and more space.
I've never really known anybody\nto say I've got too much space.
Nobody ever says that.
So maybe we'll take\na last question.
I'm wondering with\narchitectural sites--
so you have the idea of the\nmodel, which sort of exists
in a pristine state.
Do you ever have the\ndesire to or the ability
to go back and see\nsort of what happens
to these designs that have\nbecome actual buildings
and lived in?
Whether they become\ndeteriorated, or just people
decorate them differently, do\nyou have a desire to do that,
or do you ever do that?
Yeah, I do that a lot.
Actually, all of my projects\nthat I've built I tend to-- you
have to make an effort\nas an architect.
After you build\nhousing in particular,
you have to leaflet\nthe building.
When we submitted Ely\nCourt for various awards
because there's dozens\nof awards that you
can submit your projects for.
We send a letter.
We hand deliver a letter to\neverybody in the building,
and say, we are your architects.
We hope you enjoy your home.
We would like to take people\non tours of the building,
such as RIBA juries and\nvarious awards bodies.
Would you like your home to be\none of the places on the tour?
And we always get\nthree or four people
who say, sure, I'd love my\nhome to be part of your tour.
And so then we go and meet\nthem, and we get to know them,
and then we have to\nmake arrangements
with them every time we take\na jury panel like the Mies Van
der Rohe Award panel, or the\nRIBA Awards, or the housing
design awards.
You always have to take\njuries in the building.
Those awards-- they\ndon't accept photographs.
There's about 12\narchitects on the jury,
and they go around,\nand examine everything,
and interview the residents.
So you can't hide anything.
And I mean, all my products\nNewhall, Accordia, Ely Court.
They are all happy residents.
I mean, sometimes\npeople have complaints.
Sometimes bits of their\nhouse or something
goes wrong, but of course that's\ngenerally a contractor thing--
design and build.
But all of the projects--
I mean, seriously,\nthey are really
well loved by the residents.
And actually Ely Court--\nall those projects in South
Kilburn--
they're about five minutes\nwalk from my house.
So it's actually\nmy neighborhood.
So I can't not do a really\ngood job because it's my patch,
and there's something really\nkind of amazing about actually
working in your own\nneighborhood, sort
of doing urban design and\nresidential urban architecture.
You're making a piece of\nthe city that you live in.
It's public space.
I actually say housing is civic\nbuilding because it creates
the space of the street.
It creates public space.
It frames it, and the\nfacade of a building
is public realm, just as the\nground plane is public realm.
And so we have a kind\nof responsibility
and a duty to make\nthat civic space
as high quality as possible.
And if you think of housing in\nthose terms, as civic building,
suddenly your\nexpectation goes way up,
and you think of it\nas an important piece
of the future of the city--
its future heritage,\nsometimes I call that.
Thanks.
Thank you again\nfor a good lecture.
Thanks.
[applause]
