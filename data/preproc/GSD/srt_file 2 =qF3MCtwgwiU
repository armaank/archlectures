So welcome.
And I would like to thank\nyou all for being here
tonight for the talk by the\nBrazilian architect, Carla
Juacaba But first,\nI will briefly
mention a few upcoming public\nprograms here at the GSD.
So this Thursday\nevening in this room,
we'll have the Rouse Visiting\nArtist lecture, with production
designer Hannah Beachler and\ncinema scholar Jacqueline
Stewart.
Friday at the\nnoontime, we'll have
architect and\narchitectural historian
Mohammad al-Asad lecturing.
And next Thursday,\nagain in this room,
we'll have Sou Fujimoto here.
So keep-- stay tuned, guys.
And I'd also like\nto mention briefly
that this lecture is generously\nsupported by the Rachel Dorothy
Tanner Memorial\nLectureship Fund.
So tonight, we\nare really honored
to be joined by Carla Juacaba\nwhose experimental work
spans exhibition design,\ntemporary installations,
and housing.
And I think this range,\nthis real range of work,
along with her obvious notable\naccomplishments within it,
is particularly-- it's inspiring\nto those of us here tonight.
Since 2000, Carla has developed\nher independent practice
of research and\narchitecture from its base
in Rio de Janeiro, where\nher office is currently
engaged in both cultural\nprograms and private projects.
Carla was the winner\nof the first edition
of the international arcVision\nWomen in Architecture prize,
honoring her, in particular,\nfor her remarkable and ephemeral
pavilion Humanidade, for the\nUnited Nations Conference
on sustainable development.
This was a work conceived with\nthe theatre director Bia Lessa.
And the project opened\nto a kilometer long line
of spectators, which, for those\nof us here, is pretty amazing,
over half a mile.
I think that's an\nincredible detail.
In some ways it\nwas a realization
of Cedric Price and Joan\nLittlewood's Fun Palace.
Though unlike the Fun\nPalace, as Carla notes,
"the pavilion produced not\nan image of the future,
but instead tested\nthe capacity of what
was materially and ecologically\npossible in the present."
Carla has worked on many notable\nhouse projects, Italia house,
Rio Bonito house, Veranda\nhouse, Santa Teresa house,
as well as exhibition designs.
She frequently takes part\nin academic and teaching
opportunities, as\nwell as research.
She's lectured recently\nat the GSD in 2015.
We're welcome to have you--
really welcome back.
Columbia's GSAPP, the Accademia\ndi architettura, Mendrisio.
She's led workshops\nat the Iuav di Venezia
and been on the jury of the\nBIAU, Bienal Iberoamericana
in Madrid.
So-- excuse me.
Most recently, Carla\nhas contributed
to the current Venice\nArchitecture Biennale,
creating the project\nentitled "Ballast,"
which was a set of concrete\ntotems in the Giardini.
Also, she was one of the\narchitects commissioned
for the Vatican chapels\nfor the Holy See Pavillion,
which is kind of an\nincredible project
that you should\ncontinue to check out.
And Juacaba's chapel, which\nto me sort of embodies,
in a single structure,\nmaybe the entire experience
of the Woodland Cemetery.
It's incredible.
So I really am excited\nto see that tonight.
And please, join me in\nwelcoming Carla Juacaba.
[applause]
Thank you, Jenny,\nfor the introduction.
Thank you for the invitation\nand your presence.
I will begin exactly\nwith the chapel.
The title is empty space,\nbecause I think Peter Brook is
a theatre director.
And I did a workshop\nwith his [inaudible],,
which makes me think that it was\nvery interesting to understand
our discipline through\nanother discipline.
That is the theatre.
So empty space through him\nis any space in which theatre
takes place.
And this beautiful image is\nfrom his Magic Flute theatre.
And he's an English theatre\ndirector that lives in France.
And he had a successful\ncompany in the 70s, 80s.
And he uses the expression\n"poor theatre" for his theatre.
And what is wonderful to\nunderstand about his work is
that in his theatre, the\nimagination fulfills the image.
The image is not complete there.
And he construct that\nwith very poor elements.
For example, in this\nimage, he move the bamboo,
and is the cross.
And then in the second\nmoment, it's a forest.
So it's very full of meanings.
And also his sentence, "Is\nempty space insufficient?
If the answer is yes,\nthen we begin to study,
what are the\nindispensable elements?"
And I think all his work\nand theoretical work,
too, is very inspiring.
And this leanable body chair--
the name of this chair\nis [non-english],,
which means chair in\nthe middle of the road.
She also defines her\narchitecture as poor
architecture, which\nobviously, in her case,
is a direct reference\nto her Italian context,
[non-english] context, where\nshe was before moving to Brazil.
And I really liked\nthose two examples,
because it is\ninhabited to leanable
body seated, and the actors\nmoving sticks of bamboo.
And I think this is very\nbeautiful, when it's inhabited.
And the sentence of\n[non-english] about theatre
is--
the sentence of\n[non-english] is--
wait.
"Theatre is very\nsimilar to architecture,
because both involve\nan event, even
if this event happens or not."
So this is a sentence that I\nwant to use for this chapel,
because I think I\nheard many times
that the chapel is a\nsculpture, or the chapel is
an installation.
But I don't think so.
I think it is architecture,\nbecause the event happens.
It favors this event,\nas [non-english] says.
So the chapel is inside--
wait.
The chapel is in the\nSan Giorgio Maggiore
island, the island in front\nof Church of San Marco.
And this island was never\nopen to the public before.
It's the first time.
So the pavilion\nof the Holy See is
taking part of public\nfor the first time
after 33 years of event.
And Cardinal Ravasi, who is the\nPontifical Council for Culture,
said that it happened\nbecause of Papa Francisco,
because he began his pontificate\nwith a manifest that believe
in beauty to evangelize.
So all this happened\nbecause of Papa Francisco.
The concept is by Dal Co,\nFrancesco Dal Co, the curator,
who was inspired by\nGunnar Asplund's Woodland
Chapel, designed in 1924\nas the common cementary.
So here is the island.
In all this green\npart of the island,
the 10 chapels are there.
So those are the architects\ninvited for the chapel--
Berman, United States;\nFrancesco Cellini, Italy;
Corvalan, Paraguay; Flores\nand Prats; Norman Foster;
Fujimori; Sean Godsell;\nRadic; Souto de Moura.
And this is the plan.
Here in the entrance of\nSouto de Moura, which I think
it was a very nice\nchoice from the curator,
because he put the heaviest\none aside the lightest one.
And it was very beautiful\nto see this together.
This is a video from Francesco\nDal Co that's sent to all of us
to explain the site.
And in a way, it was\nvery good because we
can feel this water behind,\nand this light underneath.
And this is the site.
So we can view that this space\nis behind the green area.
And this is the project.
The chapel is made of two\ncrosses, the cross down
in the bench and the cross--
the standing cross\nis in fact the cross.
So these are the two elements,\nnot symbols, but elements
of the Catholic church.
This is a very old program.
You go to the chapel and sit\nto look at the suffering that
is the cross.
So it is a synthesis\nof this project.
Forged two beams with 8 meters\nin length composes the object,
and it is elevated by this\nseven concrete elements.
All the pieces,\nincluding the concrete,
a part has 12 by 12 centimeters.
And I think actually\nonly three of them
were needed for the\nfoundation, but I
think seven was give a metric\nto the drawing, to the design.
So it gives a measure\nto the object.
This is the side plane\nwith this shadow.
I thought that the projects\nwould be so invisible
that the shadow would become\nmore evident than the object.
And this is the lateral view.
And the front view.
I didn't knew when I\nwould propose the chapel,
but it's simply this cross\nwhen the cross is inverted.
So there is the\nother part is lower
because then Peter\nconsidered himself unworthy
to be crucified as Jesus.
And this cross became\nthe symbol of humility.
And I think it is very\nbeautiful to discover
that after everything was done.
So these are a few\ndetailing drawings,
and I think it's\nimportant to show
because everything look very\neasy to do, but it was not.
The reinforcements were needed\ninside the bench in the cross,
and everything should\nbe bolted, not welded,
because the first\nidea was to transport
this chapel to some areas.
But I just knew last\nweek that it will be
part of the Italian heritage.
And they won't take\nit out from Venice,
which looks like a dream\nfor me because it's like--
I just realized that this\nis the project of my dream
because to have a chapel in\nVenice that will stay there--
it's amazing.
And now all the bolted\nparts at the end,
they are the hidden point\nwhere we cannot see.
So everything there's\nonly one point welded.
That is the junction\nof the horizontal part
of the vertical part.
So this is the reinforcement\nin the welded part--
it's here, exactly here.
And it is made of--
in the first comment, I\ndidn't knew the material,
but in the second\nmoment, I decided
it to be of a highly\npolished stainless steel
to reflect the\nsurrounding to not exist.
So this is the\ndetail for the cross,
the connection of the cross, the\njunction between the two parts,
the horizontal and the vertical.
And this is the foundation, the\nthree points of the foundation.
And this is where\nthe problem was
because it didn't went well.
Then at this part\nwe have to weld,
and this is the final\nproject proposed
with this part finally welded.
We have a lot of\ndiscussions about this.
And the construction began.
I was not there,\nbut I was following.
I love this picture\nof the foundation.
It looks like small graves.
It's very beautiful\ninside I think.
And I never associated\nthese concrete pieces
with an astrology image\nor astrology form.
But I have a friend,\n[inaudible] is a teacher
from a Catholic\nuniversity in Rio
that wrote a thesis\nabout the chapel.
And she wrote, there\nis a possible analogy.
For us it's backbone\nfor the modern cemetery,
a body reduced to its bone,\npurified towards the absolute.
Then during that entire text of\n[inaudible] is very beautiful,
but I translated this part\nbecause of her reference
to Rossi's work.
This is her text\nabout the chapel
and this is the cemetery\nof the whole scene where
she took the reference to wrote\nabout this analogy of backbone.
And this is the first picture I\nreceived from Joao Carrilho da
Graca, the incredible Portuguese\narchitect that were there
before me.
And I think it's a\nvery beautiful picture
because it's imperfect.
The sun is exploded here.
I mean, the photographer never\ntake a picture like this,
wait for the perfect sun.
And this is the\nvery formal opening.
An aerial view-- and\nI think the chapel
is, the intention was\nto be almost invisible.
And I think it\nspeaks metaphorically
about the passage of life, about\nthe existence and nonexistence.
So sometimes you\ncan see it or not.
I think that the\nspace of the chapel
is completed by the\nsurrounding vegetation.
So there is an interior and\nthere is also an imaginary dome
between these tress.
Now, as I have said, I heard\nthat this is a sculpture
or this is an installation.
But I don't think so.
I think it's architects\nbecause it defines a place.
There is a program.
And it favors an event,\n[inaudible] says.
But I also think that it's very\ndistance from any minimalist
idea because I think the\nminimalism abstains completely
for any kind of symbolism.
And I think this\nchapel, as well as
the work of Peter Brook\nis full of symbolism.
I have chosen the\nSouto de Moura chapel
to show also because it's\naside, because it's heavy,
because it's very\nPortuguese and heavy.
And this is in a way\nvery Brazilian, I think,
very related to nature.
This is me, very happy there.
And in those pictures, this\nlooks like it was composed,
but this priest was there\nbefore the opening hours.
And he was in love.
It was very nice to see.
And this is a video\nof Gabriel Kogan.
I don't know how to do.
Is it working?
Yes.
It's a very nice video, I\nthink, because everything moves
a little bit.
It's beautiful.
And Souto de Moura with\nhis heavy, heavy chapel--
he was inspired\nby a small chapel
built in Minho, a\ncity near to Braga,
the city Braga in Portugal.
And it's exactly like\nthis at a very close end.
There's no cove.
It's only a place to stay.
This is another homemade\nwith mobile phone,
but it's nice to see.
And those Instagram\npictures that I
love because there's people and\nit's very, very spontaneous.
And it's nice.
And this is the chapel of\nSouto de Moura that is here.
This is the entrance here.
And now I brought the\nmoney to that pavilion
again because I've been here\nthree years ago presenting
this project.
But it was important\nto bring because I'm
going to show that there was a\ncommission to continue building
in the city of San Paolo in\nthe center and in Brasilia.
But the crisis in\nBrazil began in 2014,
and everything has stopped.
But I'll show the\nidea of this project.
And it's not yet a\nproject, but it's an idea.
And the pavilion is\nhere in this peninsula
between Copacabana and Ipanema.
And this is the timelapse\nof the construction.
It was constructed in six\nmonth, and the project
was four months.
As has been said, there\nwas 200,000 people
visiting in two weeks.
And the idea came from this--
I mean, Copacabana in\nBrazil is like the stage.
Everything happens there,\nall the events, all the--
so the base of this\nconstruction was already there,
and we've put white\nplastic tent over that.
And what I proposed was to\ntake out the plastic tent
and continue scaffolding\nwalls that were already there.
So I understand this building\nas a response to our time,
to our idea of sustainability\nin this location,
in this geographical point.
Well, it's very site specific.
So there's no historical\nimages about sustainability
because this, in fact,\na direct response
to this context into\nthis preexistence.
And it's there.
So the walls were already\nthere, those walls,
but were five meters high.
And this is the constructions\nthat they do every year,
and this is what happened.
They took out the plastic tents\nand continued those walls.
And the project was\nhappening between the walls
and also in the\nsubtraction of those walls
for the prep for example, the\nauditorium for 500 people.
This is the line,\nan immense line.
And this is the corridor\nthat was already there,
already exists.
And then the idea for\nBrasilia is a very hard place
to think about anything because\nthe project of the [inaudible]
project is from Lucio Costa\nand the work of Oscar Niemeyer.
And it's a very hard scale to\nintervene, to propose anything.
So it took me a very long time\nto find this idea of project.
This is that the drawing\nonly to remember this.
This is the drawing Lucio Costa.
This is a cross in this very\nisolated and central part
of Brazil, very desert.
And he won this competition\nwith this drawing,
and this is the first\nsymbol of the cross
of possession of a territory.
So in this curve\nhere appears, which
was adapted to the\nlocal topography
in the outflows of the water.
So this looks like a\nboat because of that.
So this is a pretty known\npicture of Brasilia,
and you can feel already this\nscale of someone that is here.
It's an unreachable scale.
It's very hard to work.
And this is the aerial view.
This is the center\narea of the ministries.
This is all the ministries.
And this is the Congress\nat the end, right here.
And the idea was very\nsimple at the end.
It was to repeat one\nof those ministries.
It was the same height,\nthe same measure,
the same distance between\nthem in this first space here.
So the proposal is almost\nlike urban readymade.
It is there, and\nas any readymade,
it wants to be indifferent\nto any kind of beauty.
There's a complete\nabsence of design also.
So it would be constructed\nalso of scaffolding
but of these dimensions.
And this could be the sequence\nof the [inaudible] pavilion
there.
And I name it ministry\nof all, because it's
a site of all the ministers.
And in San Paolo,\nit's another project.
It is in this area here of--
this is really the\ncenter of San Paolo.
This is the station, and this\nis the project [inaudible]..
[speaking portuguese]
And then it's project that\nin the central area here
to the stations, and\nthis empty area here.
But the project\ncould be situated
in any place with the\nsame characteristics
and the same problems because\nit's not about this place
exactly.
It's about a reflection\nabout emptiness in abandoned
spaces in central areas.
So especially in\ncentral area, I mean,
because it's very active\nareas with these immense gaps.
So the proposal is not to\nresolve this problem, this gap.
In the contrary, it\nemphasizes the problem.
It's also an idea of continuity\nof the [inaudible] pavilion.
So it would be also temporary.
So I think these\nempty areas in places
like this is very\ncommon in Latin America.
And what I proposed is--
and I think also that those\nempty areas, it's like a space
that no one ventures\nto cross this space.
It's like a rupture.
I mean, no one wants\nto traverse this.
It's very empty.
And there's like an\nimaginary wall I think.
So the project is,\nin fact, a wall
that emphasizes this rupture.
And the problem because\nit becomes more evident,
and the building's a\nsymbol of the problem.
So it is projected over the\nexisting roads, now secluded
by scaffolding walls.
And there is this one only\nfloor that everything happens
with 5,000 square meters.
And I name it only to name--
San Paolo observatory\n[inaudible] place for exhibit
and discuss the\ncity of San Paulo.
It invented a program\nto continue this idea.
So, on the contrary\nof a solution,
this temporary building\nproposes to reflect
about urban problems,\nabout interstitials
and forbidden places.
And it's obviously a fantasy.
And I will change the subject\ncompletely now to the projects
that I'm working, housing\nprojects and exhibition design
projects.
The common characteristics\nof all these houses
is that they are situated in\nthe perimeter of Rio de Janeiro,
and in this perimeter\nbetween the city
and the forest,\nthe preserved area.
And also what they\nhave in common
is that they are very\ninexpensive houses, and never
bigger than 160 square meter.
So this is the plan.
The house develops as pavilion\nparallel to the country lines.
It is totally adapted to\nthe terrain in two levels,
invisible from the street.
It is in the central\nregion of Rio.
So the first challenge was to\ndevelop an inexpensive project
and not too big.
And so I proposed this very\nlightweight structure, each two
meters.
And it made the project possible\nbecause it was very cheap.
And so this is the living\nroom here and connected
with this corridor to the room.
And there is only one--
how can I say this--
rigid line, 42\nmeters of rigid line
with different\ninclinations of the roof.
So that's it.
So the roof is the\nmost important element
of the design with four\ndifferent inclinations,
different materials.
And this is the gallery\nthat connects everything,
very close to the street\nand very open to the view.
And I think this is the\nprotecting of the project.
And it becomes a\nflashlight at night.
And this is another house, very\nclose to just one, I think.
I'm not sure if I\npresented this one.
This is, again, a reference to\nread this [speaking portuguese]
that needs a knife and a\nsupport and a neck, too.
And this is an inspiring\nimage for this project,
I think, because this house,\nthe Neimeyer House Varanda
was made in 2008.
And I think the site was\nincredibly beautiful,
and I had the feeling that\nI was destroying something.
[inaudible] said once\nthat sometimes construct
is to destroy.
So finally, I was not\ntrying to hide the house
in any side of the terrain.
The house cutted\nthe terrain in two.
And the skylight, with\nthis skylight here,
emphasized this decision of\ncutting the terrain in two.
It's 60 centimeters by\n24 meters of skylight.
Finally, the last\npresence I was looking for
had to very incisive.
The central is the living\nroom, and the bedrooms
in the extremes.
This is also-- the commission\nwas to be very inexpensive.
This is the most inexpensive\nroof, and everything else also.
So the parallel walls was\na support for this light.
This is important, also,\nin this house I think.
There's an immense with\none meter and a half of--
the roof is projected\none meter and a half.
So you open the windows when\nit's raining, not the contrary.
And this one, the\nlast exhibition design
that I did in Instituto Moreira\nSalles in Rio de Janeiro.
"A Viagem das Carrancas" is\nthe name of the exhibition,
and "carrancas" is a sculpture\nwith a human or animal form.
And it is used in the frontal\npart of the boat in the Amazon
River.
And this gained with\ntime a cultural value.
So Lina Bo Bardi\nin the '60s, also
did an exhibition\nwith this sculptures.
And it was very beautiful,\nher exhibition, I
think because she did a\nvery high support to make
the sculptures like they are\nin the boat in the high point.
So you can see it.
So I think it gave\nanotherness to the sculpture.
And I decided also\nto do like her,
to put it in a higher position,\nbut with a very different
design.
This is another exhibition\nin the modern art
museum about Brazilian jewelry,\nand I have one or two pictures
of this.
And it's a sinography,\nis many times.
I mean, it's like a scenery.
This is pieces of glasses like\nas a reference to the water,
where the stone where\nthe jewelry came from.
This was very nice.
And this is Ballast,\nthe project that
was an invitation of\nYvonne and Shelley.
It was good to\nshow this project,
but didn't really\nwork out as we wanted.
So it was a response to\nFree Space Manifesto that
evokes a general and\nvery democratic space,
yet they give an example--
they give many examples in\nthe manifest, but one of them
is the Medici Palace\nin Florence that
represented power and wealth\nbut with a stone seat, which
forms part of the\nsolid facade, almost
turns the beauty inside out.
This is what they wrote--
the solid wall becomes the\nenclosing of the public space.
So it's like a general\npiece, they said.
So the idea, the proposal\nwas to do for the Biennale
a bench with 32 meters\nlong, three benches
of 32 meters long for people\nto sit to rest in the Biennale
because they are always\ntired in the Biennale.
So I understand the\ndemocratic space
where everyone can sit and lay.
So this was made--
the proposal of this\nbench was to use
is Navy ropes,\nwhich is something
that we see in Venice all\nthe time and a reference
also to the city\ndefenses in the project.
In the project, that would be\nlike these cables of Navy ropes
and these pieces of\nconcrete to different pieces
but disposed differently.
And they wanted to do\nthat, Yvonne and Shelley,
but that was very\nexpensive, because I
learned a lot about cables.
I know nothing about\ncables, but it looks very
light for this heavy piece.
But it's not.
This was not enough\nto the strength
of this cable, the horizontal\nstrength of this cable.
So this was supposed to be made\nwith a very special concrete,
which made everything very\nexpensive and not able
to do that.
But we found out that in\nFebruary, and I said no.
So we don't do anything.
And they said, no,\nwe're going to do
at least to show this\nproject and at least do
a prototype of this.
And it was an idea, but\nI don't think it was--
So this was the idea\nof these benches.
Inside, of course not, but\nit was in the exhibitions
to show the inside.
And the problem of\ncable-- this took us many,
many months to study this\nand many months of work
to make this work.
And finally, it was impossible.
So we did finally protoype--
wait-- one third prototypes\nof the size of those
blocks only to exhibit, but\nfinally it was not a bench.
It was not a sculpture,\nbut it was an intention
to show the project only.
And this is the very simple\nfoundation at the end,
but they didn't\napprove this in Venice
because it's not possible to do\n25 centimeters of a foundation.
So the pieces of concrete, they\nare big like this, three meters
and 60.
And they get stability only\nwhen they are together.
And this is the protoype.
So in the garden\nof the Giardini--
the Giardini where\nthe work of this is.
So the work is\nthere, the work that
has the name is\n[speaking portuguese]..
So finally, it was nothing,\nbut it was an experience.
But people sit at the--
and use it like this, too.
And I'm going to return to the\nchapel to show that it became--
the kids really have\nfun with this chapel,
and I was not expecting this.
But it was very nice to know,\nand this is my son having fun.
He says, my mother\nchapel is very fun.
So it's very good to hear that.
Thank you very much.
That's it.
[applause]
I was worried to bring a project\nthat I already showed before,
but that's OK.
I'm going to open up to\nthe audience's questions.
Anyone want the\nmic for anything?
Oh, yes.
Oh, we a second mic.
Thank you.
Hi, thanks so much for\nsharing your projects with us.
I'm curious-- for working\nin a context like Santa
Teresa in Rio where you also\nhave the well-preserved turn
of the century\narchitecture as well
as some great modernist gems.
I was wondering whether it\nwas of any concern of working
in that context\nof how to respond
to these different traditions\nof Brazilian architecture.
I was not worried.
The context is always\na lot of nature,
and these houses are very far.
And it's not really\nsomething to worry about.
It's more like I respond\nto this context, how to--
I mean, that was a first\nproject, very expensive,
that the house was\nfloating there,
and it was impossible to do.
And then finally, the decisions\nto put really on the floor
to make it inexpensive.
But this is sometimes\nnot very good for you
because of the humidity there.
So it was more a\ndecision about cost.
So that's it.
Hi, thank you for talking to us.
I was wondering-- for the\npiece that you tried out
at the Biennial, why did you\nsay that it isn't a sculpture?
Because finally, it is a\nsculpture, if you want,
but it was supposed to\nbe a support of a bench.
And it was-- yes,\nthis was the idea,
not to be a sculpture\nin the garden.
So that's why.
So this is a prototype finally.
Thank you for being here.
I think one of the\nmost compelling things
about your projects was this\nchapel and the video of it
sort of like trembling with\nall the leaves and stuff.
So I guess in light\nof these discoveries,
how would you\ndesign in the future
to more of these happy,\nlittle strange things--
I don't really get\nthe question, sorry.
Can you plan for the happy\ntrembling of the chapel?
Was that anticipated?
Do you design for encountering\nnature in that specific way?
It's a question?
Maybe it's not a question.
I just think it's cool.
I mean, I think\nmaybe a way of saying
that is, do you feel\nlike you encounter
your work differently?
And once it's in\nthe world, does it
produce other facts that you\nmight not have anticipated?
Is that what you're\nsaying, Frankie?
You mean, it's in Venice.
So it's another context.
That's it.
That's maybe the question.
In any of the work,\ndoes it exist on its own
in ways that you\ncouldn't have anticipated
and that you might then\nplan for in the future?
I still don't get.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
So you wanted to\nmake a seat, right?
And you spent a lot of time\nthinking about this seat,
and you came up with\na structure to make
the seat with the ropes\nand everything possible.
In the end, this\nwas not possible.
And so you have the remnants,\nthe leftover of an idea.
But the person who was\nasking the question
was saying, well, what\nyou ended up with, you
didn't want it to be a seat.
You wanted the rope\nto be the seat.
But now you'll have\npeople enjoying
your structure, which was not\nplanned to be a seat now used
as a seat.
So is it possible to think about\nsomething that is not planned?
This was not planned\nto be a seat.
So the idea of\nunintended consequences
are sometimes very interesting.
Can you imagine thinking\nabout a slightly different way
of working where something\nlike the structure
is actually the seat,\nnot a rope anymore?
So this could also\nbe a way of thinking.
I think this is maybe a\nlittle bit part of it.
I mean, it also relates to the\nbeginning of your presentation
about Peter Brook because part\nof the discussion with Peter
Brook is about the\nidea of architecture
as a kind of setting,\nas a situation,
as a theater in a way.
It's a space of performance.
So if you work in\nthis way, you also
start imagining how your son is\ngoing to be playing with this.
So I think this connection\nbetween the event, the theater,
and architecture is very\nimportant in your work,
even though you don't\nsay it so explicitly.
So this, I think,\nis interesting,
whether you see in your work\nthis connection to theater
and to the idea of situation.
And what is the possibility\nof architecture when you
think about it in those terms?
I think this kind of\nspeculation, I think, for us
and for the students is\nprobably an interesting thing
to discuss.
Yes, for example, the\nproject of Brasilia.
It's not a project yet, but\nit's something to develop.
But I think-- and there's\na crowd where you are
seeing that there's no design.
There's no sense of design there\nbecause it's as any readymade.
And I would be very curious\nto develop this and see
the life inside this that\nhave no idea what it is
and the program of that.
So maybe this is an\nopen project to think
about this and this\nthing that we don't know.
I think this line of\nquestioning is very interesting.
I wonder if you can\nelaborate a little bit more
about this relationship that you\nhave with art and architecture.
I understand you studied\nunder Lygia Pape.
And I don't know if\nthere's a new concrete art
lineage in your work that's very\nparticipatory because I find
it very interesting when I\nhear you talk about Peter
Brook or [inaudible].
There's always this\ntheatrical element,
and then you talk about\nRossi, which is, on one hand,
for him architecture is\narchitecture or the background
for activities or the state.
I wonder if you see some\nconflict between them,
or maybe it's not a\nconflict, or something
that fused together with\nthis kind of art background
and think of architecture as\nsomething that's much more
internal and intrinsic.
Even when you talk about\nyour strategies as art terms,
as found objects\nor [non-english],,
it's very interesting in\nyour way of thinking and this
relationship between this\narchitecture thinking and art
thinking.
Yes, I think I'm still\nthinking about this,
but I think there\nare actually projects
that are a response\nto a reflection that
is not exactly as--
for example, the\nproject of San Paulo,
it doesn't want to be\na project of architect.
It wants to be a response to a\nreflection of this emptiness,
but it doesn't want to be\na project at the same this.
It's in between exactly because\nthe reflection is in between--
I mean, it's not\nproduct of architect
or that will make\nthe site better.
No, it make the site worse.
So it's the contrary.
So it is something\nto think about.
It is.
Hi, I was just\nwondering if you find
that there is a central element\nor a motivation to your work
that happens either\nintentionally
or unintentionally\nacross the board.
Yes, I think I always need\nsomething to provoke a problem.
This is in Brazil\nor San Paulo or--
I could never imagine to think\nof a project just to think.
I mean, if there's\nno problem to think,
there's no program to think.
So then the next project is--
I cannot think of the next\nproject because I need
a problem.
So it's a response to a problem.
Or in this case of San Paulo,\nBrazil invented a problem
to build something that I don't\nknow it's such architecture
or art because it doesn't--
architecture wants to resolve\nproblems and make life better.
And so that's not\nthe proper question.
Hi, over here.
Thank you for a presentation.
So I've see in your architecture\na theme lightness, openness,
and transparency.
And I was wondering if you\ncould talk a little bit more
about the aesthetic\nand tectonic choices
and the reasons\nbehind those choices.
Do you agree with me?
Yes, I think, when I said that\nthe chapel was very Brazilian,
I think the Brazilian\narchitecture
always this obsession\nof floating things.
I mean, in San Paulo\narchitecture, you can see that.
And so, it's part of our of\nthis line that floats always.
That's why the Souto de Moura\nis very Portuguese and heavy.
And I think this\nis very Brazilian
because it wants to have a\nsuspended line as the bench
also, even in the heavy support.
So I think there\nis this reference.
You asked also about Lygia Pape.
Because the school\nI studied with--
she left the school\nwhen I was there,
but it was very interesting\nbecause she kind of constructed
the school of architecture\nbut her conceptions of art.
So when I arrived\nthere, the exercises
were constructed by her.
It's funny because\nher work is known
but not her academic work.
And she's very experimental\nand very interesting.
So I think it is very\nimportant, this thing,
but it was not direct of her.
If there's one last\nquestion, we can take it.
Otherwise, thank\nyou so much, Carla.
It was really incredible.
Thank you so much.
