Good evening.
OK, I've waited\nfor the GSD time.
It's 6:37, so we can start now.
So I am here to welcome\na creative powerhouse,
spirited breaker of rules, and\na vocal advocate of equality.
That's how the jury\npraised Odile Decq in 2016
when she won the Jane Drew\nPrize for women in architecture.
It's an extremely\nimportant prize.
Previous winners, just to\ngive you an idea, had--
the previous winners\njust before her
had been Grafton Architects and\njust before that, Zaha Hadid.
So it's a very important moment.
And I like this\nadvocate of equality.
The jury also pointed out that\na survey done just the year
before in 2015--
a worldwide survey\nof over 1,000 women--
revealed that 72% had\nexperienced discrimination
or harassment\nwithin architecture.
Within the profession\nof architecture.
And the numbers\nare not going down.
They're going up.
The breaker of rules part--
so we need an advocate.
The breaker of rules\npart, it seems,
started young, as a child.
This is a story I read.
I read that when\nyou told your father
you wanted to be an architect,\nhe said, non, c'est impossible.
He said girls don't\nbecome architects.
This patriarchal\nopposition she would
convert later into a more\nsystematic resistance
through architecture itself.
If my calculation of\nthe numbers are correct,
Odile would have witnessed\nthe events of May 1968,
but as a pre-teen.
No?
Not even.
Not even born.
OK.
But maybe then\nthe consequences--
the consequences of some\nof the May 1968 events
were that the Ecole\ndes Beaux Arts
was dispersed in pedagogic\nunits across Paris.
She did attend UP-6,\nthe one in La Villette.
And, again, I get them mixed up.
But some of them were so radical\nthat they hardly held classes.
I don't know if UP-6 was--
that Pedagogical Unit\n6 was one of these.
And, subsequently, she studied\nurbanism at Sciences Po.
But that's old history.
It was really in\nLondon, in the 1980s,
that she came to her own,\nlet's say, in architecture.
She founded her studio in\n1978 in London at first--
in Paris.
In Paris.
And then, by the 1990s,\nthe work had exploded.
And that's when Odile\nDecq became Odile Decq.
For the work in the '90s, she\nwon the Golden Lion in Venice
in 1996.
After the turn of\nthe Millennium,
the work-- the\nprojects-- got larger,
the work got more diverse.
It also got more international.
She now has projects\nin China, in Italy,
some of the recent projects.
But the new millennium also\nproduced a new desire--
pedagogy.
Odile founded her own\ninternational school in Lyon
in 2007.
It opened in 2014.
It's experimental.
It's transdisciplinary.
I was with her this\nafternoon in a review,
and we are getting some\nof that pedagogy here in--
that experimental\npedagogy in her studio.
The school is\ncalled Confluence--
sorry, Confluence\nInstitute for Innovation
and Creative Strategies\nin Architecture.
And the school, as I understand\nit, like the architect,
aims to disrupt.
Original, radical,\nrule-breaking--
I witnessed it today--
a generous advocate.
We need more architects like\nher, and we welcome her.
Thanks for that, Michael.
What a generous presentation.
So, yes, first of\nall, I have to say
that I'm very glad\nto be in the GSD,
because I am experimenting--\nmy first time teaching here,
my first time lecturing here.
So, everything is\nfirst time for me.
And I'm glad to do that.
And I find the atmosphere\nof this school very cool.
You know?
I love the atmosphere\nof this school.
I don't know why, but\nyou are very unique.
You have-- it's such\na privilege to learn
and to be in such a space.
This is fantastic, and the\natmosphere is very nice.
So thank you, Michael,\nto invite me to come.
I'm very glad.
So my title is\n"Architecture Thinking."
Why?
Because, as many people\nfrom some years now,
I was talking before\nabout design thinking.
You know what is\ndesign thinking.
Everybody was talking\nabout design thinking.
And so I was using that too.
And after two, three\nyears, I was thinking,
why saying only design?
Why not talking\nabout architecture?
Because I strongly\nbelieve that architecture
is much more powerful\nthan only design.
Because if you think about--
because it is unique.
Architecture is a really unique\nfield, a unique discipline,
a culture on itself.
And with architecture,\nwe can help the world.
We can because we\nare problem solvers.
We are people unique.
Why?
Because when you are\nfacing a problem--
a question-- in architecture,\nwhatever the question is,
we have to convoke\nall the disciplines.
We have to convoke art,\nphilosophy, history,
architecture, geography,\ngeology, sociology, whatever.
Regulation, everything.
We have to convoke everything\nto understand the complexity
and to work and to analyze\nthis complex situation.
And from that, we have to be\nable to make a proposal-- first
to do a diagnosis and\nto make a proposal.
And this proposal has\nto be able to work
from a very little scale to the\nbigger one-- to the larger one.
And this is a unique\nattitude, a unique culture,
a unique discipline\nwhich is able to do that.
So, thanks to that,\nwe are unique.
When you are studying\narchitecture, this is unique.
And if you apply-- if\nwe apply that, not only
being architects, but\nif we are applying
that on many, many questions,\nmany problems, we can help.
We can make proposals.
We can propose\nsomething for the world.
And we have to speak about\narchitecture thinking
to re-implant architecture as\na central core in the world,
because this is so important.
So, first of all, I want to\nshow you some installations,
because I'm applying\narchitecture to many things.
So I do installations sometimes.
So the first one that\nI want to show you
is one from 2004 at an\nartist's space in New York.
They asked me to come\nand to do something.
And they said, you\ndon't show architecture.
You are not presenting project.
I said, OK.
So I installed a little\ncabinet in that place
which was a little corner\nin the space where--
in that cabinet.
OK.
So in that cabinet.
The floor is not flat,\nis not horizontal.
You have to enter with\na ramp and the floor
continues in ramp.
The cabinet itself has walls,\nbut the walls are not vertical.
They are sometimes--\nthey're all oblique.
Never vertical and not regular.
Some are painted in the white.
Some are covered with mirrors.
As soon as you enter in it, on\nthe one, covered by painting,
I projected images--
images of my project but\nit's not only architecture.
And because of the\nreflection into the mirror,
you discover new spaces.
So space is changing.
The perception of the space\nis absolutely [inaudible]..
So the space that you believe--\nyou see in between these two
parts, the two sides of\nthe image, is not existing,
is the reflection of something\nelse, which is on your back.
And because you were\non an oblique surface,
you don't know where--
you don't process,\nin a way, the limit
between the floors,\nthe wall, there
is a different wall\nin between them.
So I called that in 2004\nvirtual space between real.
Because you don't know what\nis this space and how it is.
And I like to play with\nthat ambiguity of perception
of the space.
In 2007, I was renovating an\nart gallery close to my office,
and the man who is the\nowner of the gallery
told me that I will be the\nfirst exhibiting in the gallery.
I said, I am not an\nartist, I'm an architect.
He said, OK, but you\nwill be the first one.
So, I remembered, at this\ntime, a little sketch
that I was doing to some people\nin my office to explain what
I call dynamic equilibrium.
Equilibrium could be reached\nwith two columns and a beam.
It's easy, it's\nsimple, it's stable.
But I like when something\nis unstable, looks unstable.
So when you have\njust one column,
you have to estimate how to\nmake equilibrium between two
strengths, two forces.
So we built that\nwith two balloons.
One is a balloon of air,\ntwo meters diameter.
And the other one is\na balloon of-- it's
just a bubble in aluminum\nfilled with sand.
And in between them,\nthe beam that you see
is 6 centimeters\nby 6 centimeters.
It is 6 meters long.
And the column is 6\ncentimeter by 6 centimeter,
one above the other\nwithout fixation.
So we had to calculate\nwith our engineers
the precise position\nof this point where we
install the beam on the column.
And we had to fill at\nthe ends with sand, grain
by grain, to reach equilibrium.
And when you were to feel the\ninstability of this equilibrium
by walking into the\nspace, because the balloon
of air is filling the space--
when you are walking on the\nside, the air is moving.
So the balloon is\nmoving a little bit.
And you feel that this\nstability is nearly unstable.
And I like this idea of\nbeing always unstable, always
in movement.
In France, we have a\ngarden festival every year,
and there are thematics.
And in 2009, they announce\nthe thematic of colors.
And somebody in my office said,\nwhy not propose a black garden?
I said, OK, why\nnot a black garden?
So we did then propose\na black garden.
We did the black installation,\nand we have been chosen.
We have been selected.
And we built its [? sides ?]\nwith sheets of glass--
black glass-- and filling\nthe floor with powder--
tire powder.
Very thick.
15 centimeters thickness.
And in the middle, a little\nsurface of water on a black
surface.
To have a silentious garden.
Because the thematic of\nthe garden, as I said,
the official was colors.
So everybody all around\nwere using multiple colors
everywhere.
It was very noisy of colors.
And I wanted that in my garden,\neverybody was silentious.
So because of this tire powder\non the floor, when you come in,
all the sound is absorbed.
If you come with somebody, you\nwant to talk to him or her,
and you can't listen,\nbecause all the sound was
absorbed by the floor.
And so this is a very\nsimple installation.
But thanks to the\nsun, the impression--
its sense of perception,\nbecause of the reflection,
because of that loss of\nreflection in between them,
between the reflections\nof the trees et cetera.
So it was a place of\nsilence and reflection.
In SCI ARC in 2011, they\nasked me to do something
in the exhibition room.
And when architects\nusually build an object,
I created a new space.
And the space is very simple.
Four triangles equilateral.
But the walls are not vertical.
Everything inside is\ncovered with mirrors.
The space pass-- the\npassage between the spaces
is not at the same place.
So when you come in,\nas you see from above,
when you come in you see the\nobject, which is inclined.
And inside, you don't\nperceive what is the space.
You can't understand the\nspace because, again,
of the reflection.
You don't know\nwhere are the limits
between the walls, the floor.
So, is it a door, a passage?
Or is it just a\nreflection of another one.
Where are the passage?
So you have to play.
You enjoy being there, because\nyou have to find your own way
and you don't understand\nwhat is the size, the space--
the form of the space.
And I love to play with\nthat, as I said before.
And in Milan, every year\nin the furniture fair,
they ask in a\nuniversity in the garden
to architects,\nartists, and designers,
to do something with a factory.
And they asked me to work\nwith a factory of ceramic,
And they wanted to\npropose ceramics,
which were three meters\nlong and one meter wide,
but only with three\nmillimeters thickness.
And they wanted\nme-- or they were
thinking that I will\nshow that as a floor
and walls, et cetera.
But I wanted to\nexpress a thickness--
the extreme thickness of\nthe ceramic by making--
sending them up,\ncrossing sheets of--
still to maintain them\nvertical, to build like a cube.
But cutting the cube\nwith, like, a balloon
passing through, to\nbe able to come in
and to walk on the edge\nof the ceramic, which
is 3 millimeters thin.
So architecture, because\nI do architectural also.
So first, Macro, the Museum\nof Contemporary Art in Rome,
that I won in 2000 and\nfinished and delivered in 2010.
So this is-- is it?
OK.
So we are here.
This is the extension\nof this part, which
was just renovated in these two\nold buildings with a courtyard.
And this site is 3,000\nsquare meters of footprint.
We are at the corner\nof two streets.
And there was an entrance\nhere, and then we
have to create a\nnew entrance here.
So I decided to\ncover all the site
with a roof that fills all the\nsite, to create a new entrance
here at this corner, to\ninstall the main exhibition
room of 1,000 square\nmeters at the corner--
simple-- to have in\nthe middle a foyer,
to have in the middle of\nthe foyer is the auditorium.
Above the auditorium, a glass\nsurface with a fountain.
It's a fountain because\nthere's water running on it.
To leave a little bit of a hole\ninto the ceiling with a garden,
with trees.
And to maintain what I\nwas asked to maintain,
this structure with a roof.
We are at the corner\nof the two streets.
And this is the new entrance.
And the glass box here is a\ncafe, because we are in Rome
and in Rome in every\nstreet there are cafes.
And you go to drink\ncoffees everywhere.
So I wanted to have the\ncoffee in the street.
There is no coffee\nat the moment.
So the entrance is to\ncome into the cafe.
The glass box is suspended\nto the existing facade
that they had to\nkeep at both sides.
And to come in, you have to pass\nunder the cafe without columns.
So the box is flying above.
And you have to cross\nthe little garden
with the trees [? growing ?]\nvery fast to the roof
to enter into the foyer.
And the foyer is black.
Everything inside is black.
It's the first time that I use\nblack in one of my buildings.
I know that everybody believes\nthat I build in black,
but this is my first\nbuilding in black.
And, if you look carefully about\nthe floor, the floor is basalt.
And basalt is a stone which is\nused in the pavement in Rome.
So the city is coming into--
the city is coming into--
this is back.
I want to go back, but I\ndon't know how to go back.
There is no way to go back.
Doesn't matter.
So this is--
I don't-- no mistake.
So the floor is a\ncontinuity of the street.
So this is a public space,\ninternal public space,
which is running everywhere.
And in the middle of that,\nwe have the auditorium.
So, the new part of\nthe museum is installed
between two surfaces--
the surfaces of the\nfloor, of the foyer, which
is internal public\nspace, and the surfaces
which is above the\nexternal public space.
And in between, we\nhave another layer,
which is this surface, which\nis a promenade at mid-level
into the foyer.
Passrails that helps to go--
that drive you to go\nabove the auditorium.
And with a fountain above\nand with water running on it.
And the auditorium\nis non-regularly
shaped, specially\nshaped irregular
to be able to give the\nimpression that it is a little
bit unstable.
And digging the floor\ndown to install lighting.
And the last director\ninstalled mattress
underneath with little\nvideo screen here.
And the kids were laying\nunder the auditorium
to watch the video collection\nunder the auditorium.
And the auditorium is\npainted in red outside.
And you can enter in\nit using this ramp.
And inside, everything is red.
This is the heart of the place,\na place where you gather,
a place where you meet, a place\nwhere you discuss about video,
about cinema, about art.
And the city asked\nme at one point
during the development\nof the project
if I wanted to\ndesign everything.
And we decided to\ndesign everything,
including the seats,\nincluding the lighting system,
including-- so it's a\nglobal, total project.
And the main exhibition\nroom that I told you
is 1,000 square meters,\nand in the brief,
which was very little, they\nasked for different heights
in the space because they\ndidn't know at the beginning
that it will have been a\ncontemporary art museum.
They were thinking of\nhaving performances
to having theater to having\ndance ballet, et cetera.
So they asked for\ndifferent heights.
So it goes from places where\nyou have 11 meters high to,
on this side, 7 meters high.
And in between, you\nhave this passrail,
which is coming from the foyer,\ntraveling along the wall going
up to the terrace.
So this is a possibility to\nvisit and to exhib-- to look at
and to watch the\nexhibition, which
is down from this passrail.
It's another layer of promenade\nunder the structure, which
is quite heavy because\nI didn't want to have
any columns in the museum.
This is just a flying roof, as\nI said, supported by the wall
in between the foyer and the the\nexhibition room and the pyramid
tile walls.
Above, this is a huge space.
This is a place, a\nsquare, a public square.
Because you can come\nfrom the former entrance,
across the courtyard,\ntake a ramp,
come here, travel this space,\ntake a stair somewhere there,
and go back to the street.
So you can traverse\nthe museum above.
That means that this place\nbecomes a public square
for the surrounding area.
And this is more than a\npublic space because--
a public place because\nthere is a fountain
and there is a restaurant and\nthere's a cafe with a terrace.
So this is a place where\nyou can stay as everywhere
in the square in Rome,\nsitting outside in front
of the restaurant in\nfront of a fountain.
And we designed the lamps\nfor the terrace also.
And the cafe is\nmulticolor floors.
I don't use only black.
This is multicolor\nfloor for the cafe.
And by having the cafe at\nthe mid-level and the terrace
above with the restaurant,\nthat means that the floor down
is at the level of the usual\nentrance of every building.
So the floor is as the museum--
the entrance to the museum--\nis at the level of the entrance
of every building around.
But the cafe is in\nthe street, but it's
at the mid-level\nof the building.
So the people from the first\nfloor and the second floor--
the second floor\nand the subfloor
are at the level of the cafe.
And the people who\nare living above
are at the level of the\npublic square above.
So everybody is taking\nin account the spaces
of the museum in front of them.
Toilets.
I love to design toilets.
Because this is the only\nspace in a building where
you don't have regulation.
Think about that.
So you can experiment.
You can play with toilets,\nwith the space of a toilet.
So my toilets in the museum\nare like a container covered
by stainless steel mirrors\noutside and inside, in stalls
and over all structures.
In the middle of the space,\nyou have this huge space,
and at the extremity of\nboth sides we have mirrors.
So the space is repeated\ninfinitely into these mirrors.
And I did this experiment of\nspace in a reference to a movie
by Jacques Tati, Playtime And in\nPlaytime that Jacques Tati did
in the '60s, mid '60s,\nhe was expressing
the ultra modernity of the\ncities which were coming.
And he did a movie where\neverything in the city
is smooth, flat, bright,\nno asperity, no rugosity.
And the main character, who\nis played by Jacques Tati,
is walking into the city.
And at one point\nat the beginning,
he enters into an\noffices building,
and he's wearing laser\nsoles under his shoes.
And because he is\nwearing leather soles
and he's walking on a steel\nfloor, it makes noise.
Click, clack, click, clack.
And I think, OK, this is\nnice for playing with that.
So I designed\neverything in steel.
So the floors, the\nwalls, and the ceiling
are in stainless steel mirror.
And inside in the infinity\nspace, doing into the mirrors.
In the middle of\nthe space, there
is this object, which is\na parallelpiped white,
and in glass.
And above it, there is a kind\nof landscape in depression.
This is the only place where\nyou can wash your hands,
but you don't know how to do it.
So you have to go\nthere, and you start
to make dancing\nyour hands above.
And as soon as you\ncross an infrared ray,
the cubes becomes--\nthe room becomes red,
and the water is coming up.
And if you make dancing\nyour hands at the corner,
the dryer is coming up, too.
So you play, yourself, and you\nbecome actors in the toilets
when you are going to make\ntoilets in the museum.
Everybody's smiling\nwhen they get out.
So, I love to design toilets.
In Paris, I received a call\nonce when I was in a weekend
from somebody who was the\nmanagement of a new restaurant
in l'Opera Garnier, which\nwhere there were never
have been a restaurant,\nto do a restaurant
under this cupola, which was\nan open space where the horse
carriages were coming in before.
And after that it has\nbeen a depositor storage,
so it has been\nabsolutely in despair.
So they wanted to establish\na restaurant there.
And I discovered\nthat, as soon as--
he told me that, OK, he\nwants to work with me,
he had a recommendation from\nthe Ministry of Culture,
because this is more--
it is the most protected\nhistorical monument in France,
because it has been untouched\nsince Charles Garnier did it
in the middle of\nthe 19th century.
And Charles Garnier not\nonly did the building,
but he designed the facade\nof the buildings all around.
So this is a public\nspace, protected,
and a museum and a\nbuilding, protected.
So I had to--
for enclosing the space I had to\ncreate a facade with the space
which was open to the outside.
And it was forbidden to create\na facade, because the minister
of culture said, don't create--
don't put glass\nhere, because you
will do a facade with\narches or with columns
that Charles Garnier didn't do.
I said, OK.
So I had to create a new floor,\nbecause the space was not
big enough.
And they told me,\ndon't create a floor,
because Charles\nGarnier didn't do.
OK, Charles Garnier didn't\ndo, but I have to do it.
So, it was the only\nplace-- and as I said,
you can't touch the columns,\nyou can't touch the cupola,
you can't touch the wall.
You can only touch the floor.
OK.
So I started by doing--
I have to close, so I started\nby doing this sinuous line
behind the columns.
Because I know how\nto work with glass,
I was thinking that\nby creating volumes
of sheets of glass, sinuous,\nthey will be self-stable.
And anchored to the floor,\nthey could be self-stable.
And if I use a very\nclear glass, they
will not see that\nthere is-- they will
see that there is no facade.
OK, so it was agreed.
After that, I had to\ncreate a mezzanine.
So I continued to\n[? sinuous ?] the lines,
and this without\ntouching the columns,
without touching the walls.
And this-- the\nposition of this line
was a long\nnegotiation between me
and the National Commission\nfor Historical Monuments,
because they wanted that I\ngo back, because they wanted
to-- that people coming\ninto the restaurant
will see that they are\nentering into the cupola,
because they will see\nthe center of the cupola.
So this line has\nbeen a negotiation.
At the end they agree,\nand it's like that.
So this is sheets of glass,\ncoming up, undulating,
coming up to six meters\nhigh, at the height
of the [? corniche. ?] And then\nother sheets of glass above.
An in between them,\ntwo maintain them
in place, this little\npiece of steel.
Inside, the mezzanine is built\nin steel structure, covered--
surrounding by molded plaster.
And when doing that, I had\nto push back my columns
close to the other columns\nwithout touching them,
because I didn't want\nthat I have any columns
in the middle of the cupola.
So that means at this\npart of the mezzanine
is in cantilever of 10 meters.
And by doing that\nsystem of construction,
I did exactly as\nCharles Garnier.
Because Charles\nGarnier did the project
by winning a\ncompetition in 1950.
And he was 35 years old when\nhe won this competition.
And he was modern for his time.
So he decided to build\nthe structure in steel.
So what you look\nat as stone columns
is a steel structure\nsurrounded by stones.
And in between, there are the\nshafts for the ventilation
and heating system.
So I did exactly the same.
A steel structure,\nsurrounded by--
I don't know to go back, sorry--
surrounded by molded plaster\nwith everything technical
inside and having that turning\nand twisting with this molding
plaster with acoustic\nplaster, et cetera--
different kind of plaster--
to make it absorbing, because\nof the [? mineralization ?]
of the space.
The floor, the walls, et cetera.
I wanted to have an\nabsorbing system.
And in the back, there is a\nlounge with a long sinuous
bench or sofa, if you\nwant, with the doors
coming to the foyer\nof the Opera directly.
And underneath, it's like being\nunder an animal, a very strange
animal.
Everything is red and white.
And the lighting system--\nthe lighting devices--
are in the pocket in\nthe legs of the animal,
because I didn't want to look at\nand to see any technical device
in the building,\nbecause they were not
seen from Charles Garnier.
And everything in the mezzanine\nis red, the seats and tables
and the benches and the sofas.
There are a mirrors to express--
to enhance the\nimpression of space.
And, if you look\ncarefully about the sides,
the top of the\nglass, it has been
cut depending on the cupola.
And every sheet of\nglass is different.
The curve is different and the\ncut is different at the end.
And this is not\nanchored into the stone,
because between the\nglass and the stones
there are 4 centimeters\nof silicon joints.
I did also make another\nmuseum in France,
in Rennes, in Brittany.
And it's in a park, a new\npark, in a new development
area where there were\nbefore this piece of art.
And this piece of art is a\nunique three-dimensional piece
of art of an artist\ncalled Aurelie
Nemours, a French artist.
It is a unique\nthree-dimensional piece.
And she is working\nonly on numbers.
And this piece is\nher number nine.
Because every stone is 4 meters\nin height and have height.
The section is 72\ncentimeters by 81.
And the angle of the\nposition of the square,
because it is 72 stones, is\nthe specific angle online.
And she gave regulation\nto the architecture.
So usually the architects\nwill give regulation
on architecture.
But this is an artist\nwho gave constraints.
She said that she wants to\nhave a silentious facade
for the museum, and\nshe wanted not to light
a piece from the building.
So I respect what\nshe asked, and I
decided to have a silentious\nblack facade with two
materials, because this\none is above-- in front
of the main exhibition\nroom and down this
is the lobby, the foyer.
But the height of the cut\nbetween the two materials
is exactly the same\nheight as the stones.
And what you see as gray is\nblack stainless steel mirrored.
So because it's\nmirrored, it reflects
and it plays with the sky.
So it changes\ncolors all the time.
Down, this is gray--
dark gray glass.
And because it's dark gray, you\nperceive it black in the day.
This is how it's built. So\nthis is steel construction
with a cantilever with a big\nstructure of the main exhibit
hall attached to\nthe back side, which
is a concrete block,\nblack concrete.
But this is black\nconcrete, so that
means that when it's\ndry weather, it's gray;
when it's humid\nweather, it's black.
So this building is a\nmonolith-- black monolith--
with three kinds of\nblacks that are changing,
depending on the weather.
So this is-- the\nentrance is here.
You don't see it.
Doesn't matter.
Everybody knows.
And so this black monolith\nis cut in the middle.
Like that.
And I tried to find a space\ninto that black monolith
by creating that.
By cutting the building,\ncreating a big atrium
from the roof to the\nstorage, eight meters below,
and having the auditorium\nat the entrance,
but only the back\nof the auditorium.
So when you enter,\nyou see the light.
You are full of light.
But you can't go into the space.
For going there-- to start\ntraveling the museum,
you have to go back to the\nfacade and start to climb
the steps--
the steps all along the facade,\nin between the auditorium
and the facade.
That is transparent, and you are\nreferring to the piece of art
which is outside.
You go to the cafe\nat the beginning.
Up into the park.
And on the back of the cafe,\nyou can enter the space.
And you start by\nclimbing some steps.
Sometimes it's a ramp,\nand sometimes it's
a stair, with sheets\nof steel anchored
into the concrete, just that.
And with the parapet, which\nis quite heavy on the round
rails to make people not having\nvertigo and being protected.
And the glass is\nsuspended underneath.
And you climb.
And you climb 30 meters\nhigh for this space.
The exhibition rooms\nare very simple,
because this is\nplaces far artists.
So this isn't a place\nwhere architects
can express themselves.
I just framed the park outside.
And, going to the top--
so the void is 30 meters high.
Open at the end to the west, so\nsometimes the sun is coming in.
And toilets, again.
Black and mirror this time.
So, this is just a sinuous\nmirror in between the basins--
the wash basins for\nthe men and women.
When you go to wash\nyour hands, you
look at you curved or in\nthe inverse of a curve.
So you never look at yourself\nas you are, because you
are thicker or thinner.
Never your size.
And they find that at the\nbeginning very violent.
And I said, no, this is\njust for people being actor.
And in the evening,\nthe proportion inverse,
so the the top becomes dark,\nthe bottom becomes lighted,
and we lighted the\nauditorium, until it
becomes dark and totally black.
In Lyon, we have developed\nand won a competition in 2005
and built in 2014.
And we are in the peninsula\nwith the confluence.
And this is [inaudible]\nof the city,
with these cranes still there.
And at the end of\nthe peninsula I
want the position\nof this building.
And these two buildings-- maybe\nyou heard about this building.
This is the Musee des\nConfluences by Coop
Himmelb(l)au, for Prix.
And this is 2,000 square\nmeters of exhibition
and a huge, huge, huge space\ninside for the entrance lobby.
My little building,\nbecause [inaudible]
in comparison to him is very\ntall, is 8,000 square meters.
But it's more compact.
And this building was supposed\nto be a parallelpiped.
And I decided not to\ndo a parallelpiped--
OK, to do a parallelpiped,\nbut to shift
the top part of\nthe parallelpiped
above the riverbank.
Shifting, why?
Because I wanted to have--
this is a riverbank, and this\nis a building in cantilever.
One, two, three,\nfour, five floors,
in cantilever above\nthe riverbank.
And in the middle,\nI had an atrium.
So I shifted the atrium, and\nthe atrium is passing above.
To build that building, we built\nat the beginning three pylons,
a cross of beams, perimeter\nbeams, and we hang everything.
So we built from the top to\nthe bottom, at the inverse.
Like that.
And at the end, this is\na building in cantilever,
above the river.
Above the bank of the river.
And this is 25\nmeters of cantilever.
And on the facade, what\nyou see is a picture.
It is a photo.
It's an artist piece.
Because we have been\nasked, for the competition,
to work with an artist.
And I decided to work\nwith Felice Varini, who is
a Swiss artist living in Paris.
And this artist is\nworking on the question
of perspective point of view.
And he told me, when I came\nto him and said, Felice,
I have a building that my\nproposal is very simple.
It is a parallelpiped.
Can you transform my\nperception of my building?
And he said to me,\nimmediately, don't
give an order to an artist.
I don't receive orders.
I said OK.
You do as you want, Felice.
You come back when you want.
So he came back to me some\nweeks later or some days later--
I don't remember.
And he said, OK, architecture\nis very arrogant.
Because when architecture\nis installed on a landscape
or cityscape, it erases--
it erases-- the landscape\nwhich was there before.
So I want to replace the\nlandscape on your building
to erase the architecture.
But in black and white.
So he took\n[? virtually ?] pictures
on the top of the building,\non the four directions.
And we have here\napplied the photos
of the scenery which was on the\nback and the four directions
on the facade.
So you see that the\ncantilever has been shifted--
shifted the auditorium.
And so that, when you\ncome under the building,
you see that there\nis a glass ceiling.
And you look through\nthe building.
It's like looking through\nthe building in the atrium,
looking under the dress of the\nbuilding or the [inaudible]..
I know that I can't\nsay that in America--
excuse me, the States.
Excuse me-- I can't say that.
But I a woman, so\nI can say that.
OK.
So, inside the spaces are\nvery big on the ground floor,
because it's good--\nit's an events place.
Because it's a company who\nis doing events everywhere,
managing the big events of\nthe world-- of World Cup,
Olympic Games--
so this is a very huge company.
And they wanted to\norganize events.
So the entrance is very big.
And above the steel\nstructure is very present.
This is like a kind of\na very strong structure.
But everything-- all\nthe floors around,
all the open spaces of offices\nare open to the center,
and they can communicate.
The spaces are sometimes open\nspaces, sometimes closed,
with glass partitions, so\neverything is transparent.
Like that.
And because we are in\nan office building,
I had to face two\nproblems, because I didn't
want to keep the full ceiling.
Because if I had to transfer\nthe energy of the [inaudible]
to the slab--
there's a concrete slab.
And when you have a full\nceiling, you can't do it.
You have to keep\nthe false floor,
because you have to have all\nthe connections for the offices.
But the [inaudible],,\nyou could take it out.
And you have to reorganize\nthe system of [inaudible] very
precisely.
But after that, I have\nto face two problems--
the question of acoustic and\nthe question of the lighting.
I can find devices for acoustic\npanel or devices for lighting.
And I was thinking,\nwhy not combining both?
And I proposed-- did a\nsketch of an object which
is what I call a Petal, which is\nan acoustic panel with lighting
underneath.
And it absorbs the sound from\nthe bottom and from the top.
So my toilets in the\n[inaudible] are in red.
OK.
This is just a toilet.
In China-- again I\nwon a competition,
because everything\nis by competition.
It's a very\ninteresting site, one
I worked by driving\nfrom Nanjing--
and it's a place where\nthey discovered the bones
of the first Homo erectus.
The man of Nanjing.
And into the cave of one--
one of the cave\ninto the mountains.
So I went to the site.
I visited the cave.
And it's very\nmoving when you are
walking into the\nunderground in a cave
in the grotto, where they found\nthe bones of the Homo erectus.
Because you think\nthat you are walking
on the same paths\nthan Homo erectus.
And so the site was\nso big that they
said that we can install the\nbuilding were we want it.
So I decided to use the\nmountain as bringing my museum,
because this is for the man of\nNanjing who was living there.
So I wanted to bring back\nthe museum from the mountain.
By playing with the lines\nof the site of the mountain,
of lifting them, leaving\nthem down, going to a model
in papers for the museum,\nwhich is like that.
And this is\nreconstructing, rebuilding,
in a way, the lines-- the\ncurved line of the site,
but in another way.
And have the possibility to go\nup as a landscape onto the roof
and inserting the museum\ninto the landscape.
Rebuilding the lines with\nstones on the facade.
Recreating the lines on the\nlandscape in the garden.
Having in the middle--
somewhere in the space.
Not in the middle.
In the entrance,\nthe foyer, which
is an atrium-- with an atrium.
Because I wanted,\nagain, to make people
traveling into the museum.
But it's 20,000 square\nmeters of museum,
with a program which\nwas very light.
So I didn't know precisely\nwhat they wanted to have,
but I know that they\nwill have exhibition
on both sides of the atrium.
And I know that it will be-- it\nwill have been a lot of people.
Not only thousands of people\nbut maybe millions of people.
So I wanted to play with\nthe possibility for people
to travel.
So I decided to create an\natrium which is an irregular
shape or form and to make it\nsliding from floor to floor,
having escalators in between\nand not at the same place,
to make people\nclimbing to a floor,
turning around the atrium\nto take the second one
and turning and\nturning, to discover
what is exhibited on\nboth sides and to choose
where to go to visit.
Climbing the space like that.
And to the top.
In Paris, we had before\na very huge warehouse
of 600 meters long in\nthe north of Paris--
inside Paris in the north.
It has been built in the '60s.
The city of Paris bought it in\n2009 and it's-- no, not 2009,
at the beginning of 2000--\nand decided to transform it
as a kind of a new area,\nnew quarter of Paris.
So they did a competition, and\n[? omar ?] won the competition
and after that chose architects\nto build above the building.
Because they discovered where\nthey studied the buildings,
that the structure\nwas strong enough
that they can build\nsix floors above.
So they chose architects\nfor building housing
above the building.
They cut the building to\nlet the tramway passing--
a new tramway passing through.
Continuing by housing,\ntwo buildings of offices,
my building for incubator--\nstartup incubators--
and cutting the building there,\norganizing the competition
that Kengo Kuma won for\nsport facilities and schools.
So this is a huge\nbuilding of 600 meters
long with multi-story\nfacilities and commercial center
into the old\nstructure, two floors
of car park underneath\nthat they build.
And my building is an\nincubator for start ups,
so I decided not to have a\nnormal facade for offices, just
to make bubbles.
And on the south\nfacade, they are white.
On the north facade,\nthey are black.
And in between, my east\nfacades are black and white.
So, as soon as I did\nthat for the facade,
I decided that the building\nwill be only black and white,
except some bubbles in red.
Why not?
So, that means that when you\nenter, this is the entrance.
Black and white.
Above, there is a flying\nbubble for meeting rooms.
And the back, there is the\nsame, another meeting room--
bubble red, black, and white.
You can enter into the bubble\nlike that, with a passrail,
and you enter into\nthe bubble, where
you can sit along this table,\nwhich is not a normal shape.
But you can seat by 2, by\n3, by 4, by 10 at the end,
if you want.
But you are always as you want.
We designed the carpet also\nwith bubbles [inaudible]..
And the lift floor, so\nwhen you arrive at the--
when you take a lift,\nyou have black and white.
And you push the button.
And there is one black or\none white which is coming.
We never know.
At the first floor you have\nthese big meeting rooms
and conference rooms, red again.
At some floors--\non many floors--
you have this convivial\nspace, as they call it--
[? colinear ?] space, where we\ndesigned the furniture to have
places where people can rent--
sit around the floor\nto sit and to work,
like a coworking and\ninformal spaces for working.
And on the top, when\nyou have the bubbles.
This is fantastic,\nbecause the view
is over Paris is fantastic.
At this moment we are\nstarting the construction
of a tower in Barcelona\nthat we won in 2015.
So we are at the end of\nDiagonal, close to the sea.
And we are precisely there.
Here, this is a formal--
the tower for Telefonica,\nfor the telephone company.
And this was a\ntower until there.
It was a concrete\nblock, not finished
for 10 years, 12 years.
And an American-- and an\ninternational fund bought it
and did a competition to\ntransform it into a high-class
level, high-level class--
I don't know, I\nalways say that--
for residential.
And we have to destroy a\npart which is on the back,
rebuild more floors above--
so reinforce the structure\nto build floors above--
create balconies in\ncantilever on both sides.
So this is a huge\nconstruction at the beginning
to create that tower.
With a floor which is 10\nmeters high for the lobby
and the restaurant,\nand using again
this curved facade on the\nback of the columns which
are existing.
And by chance, the\ncompany who was
doing the curved facade for\nL'Opera is based in Barcelona.
So we worked with them,\nwe discussed with them.
And I asked them to\nwhich height we can go.
And they said nine meters.
I said, OK, we will do\nnine meters this time.
So each piece of glass\nwill be nine meters
with a specific\ncurve, et cetera.
Playing with glass is nice.
On the back this is more scene.
And on the top, there\nis a swimming pool
that you can swim with looking\nat the sea at 100 meters high.
And some red balconies.
No black.
Red balconies.
I did sometimes\na little project.
So, I have been asked by an art\ncollector who is owning this--
oh, how can I go back?
It's stupid.
Doesn't work.
Oh, thank you.
OK.
I'm stupid.
Sorry, I have to\nkeep [inaudible]..
She is living here\nin this little castle
above Grenoble in the Alps.
And here there is the Gulf of\nGrenoble, and this is a slope.
And she wanted to have an\nartist residence at this place
into the trees.
I went there, and I discovered\nthat the landscape in front
of--
on this side is\nabsolutely amazing.
This is the Alps chains\nin the valley of Grenoble.
But I wanted to protect\nher from the place
from the artist in residence,\nnot to disturb her.
So I decided to do a silentious\nblack block, all in wood.
So I decided, because we are\nin the Alps, to build in wood.
So this is a wood block\nstructure and outside
and covered with black\nbeeches, to protect it.
And this black block, which\nis regular on the top,
is twisted when it goes down, to\nhave possibilities for the sun
to come from\ndifferent directions,
without overlooking\nto the castle above.
So we have a kind\nof a twisted block.
Like that.
With the workshop\nfor the artists,
which is anchored\ninto the fortification
to protect the wall which is\nsupporting the garden above.
And a belvedere above, which\nis overlooking the landscape.
So this is a black house.
And I did a white house.
So this one-- the\nfirst one was in wood.
This was all in glass.
It's in Brittany, for a man\nwho was an English man--
and a couple-- who had\nan illness in his eyes
and wanted to have\nsomething absolutely bright
with a lot of maximum of\nlight inside the house.
Because he's an industrial,\nworking with glass and steel,
he wanted to build\nthat in glass.
So we did a total glass house.
Everything is in glass.
It's parallelpiped\ninclined, with white glass--
with double glass together--\nwith a form inside.
It's not transparent.
It's translucent.
And the black volumes are the\nkitchen and the bathrooms.
Everything inside is in\nglass, even the staircase.
And we have so little windows,\ntransparent sometimes.
But everything is inclined\na little bit particular.
And this one, I\ndidn't design it.
This is not my design.
I have been called by the\nowner of this house when they
returned from this house--\na brother and a sister--
that [inaudible]\nhouse has been built
between the mid\n'60s to the mid '70s
by two men, the\narchitect and the owner.
And they built that by\nthemselves, by hand.
This is a steel\nstructure, curved,
whereas it projected on its\nconcrete, polished by hand.
And the back, they did--
they projected insulation\nand plaster, polished again.
So it took a long time.
And this is, at the end, 600\nsquare meters of bubbles.
And they wanted to renovate it.
So I renovated and waterproofing\nthe outside and renovated
everything inside by colors.
So this is-- it's\namazing, this house.
I enjoyed to do that.
It was really funny for me.
And living there,\nsleeping in the bed--
a round bed in the round\nbubble-- is fantastic,
believe me.
So, the first part that we\nrenovated was a living room.
So we did right at the beginning\nand renovated the cushions
only.
So starting by-- because\nit was-- the cushions
were like that.
So we rebuilt them.
And I started by\nplaying with the colors.
Because it was the '60s and\n'70s, and I was thinking about
pop art.
So it was multi-colorful.
We started with the colorful.
And after that, we did--
this is one of the bathroom.
Can you imagine?
I took a bath in that bathroom.
This is fantastic.
[laughter]
Look at that.
And we did pink,\nblack, more pink.
Sometimes mandarin, sometimes\norange, depending on the room.
Sometimes more, again, pink.
Look at that.
I dream of having drawn that.
And these are\ndesigns that, I was--
when I discovered\nthat, I thought,
my god this is so\namazing to do that.
The corridor, between\noutside and inside.
And at the end, the last room\nthat we renovated, we decided--
because we, after-- we\ndid that in five years.
We campaign every year of\nrenovating part of the house,
playing with colors, et cetera.
So thematics of the\nrooms were in one color.
Then playing in different\nlayers of these colors.
At the end, so--
and we did colors by colors.
At the end, for the\nlast room, and when
I speak about the room, this\nis a bedroom, a living-- no,
two bedrooms, a living room,\na kitchen and a bathroom.
So they are, kind\nof, apartments.
Because the owner had two kids\nand every kid had an apartment.
And they're all connected.
This is why, at the end,\nit was 600 square meters.
So at the end, I did not\nhave ideas for a new color.
I said to the owner, maybe we\ncan use all of them together.
And we played with all the\ncolors at the same time,
like that, creating the\nfurniture sometimes.
So this is fun, it was fun.
And I too, I said,\nafter the first year,
I said to the owner,\nyou know, I think
that the statement of the\nhouse, and the colors is,
too much is never enough.
This is book by Lapidus\nwhich is titled,
Too Much is Never Enough.
And I like to be-- to think\nthat too much is never enough.
This is a good statement for\nstudents in architecture.
Too much is never enough.
[applause]
No, no, it is not finished!
[laughter]
So I do design, I do design.
So I won a competition for\nthe UNESCO headquarters
for renovating the [inaudible].
So this building has been\ndone in Paris in the '50s
And I won the competition\nfor [inaudible]..
And as soon as I\nwon the competition
for the [inaudible],,\nthe director told me,
but you know, in the\nconference room, which
is 700 square meters,\nwe need furniture.
Can you propose us something?
I said, can I design?
They said yes.
Because I was dreaming of\ndesigning furniture, but OK.
So I first starting\nby doing the counter.
And because it was from the\n50s, this building, I said, OK,
'50s were the early\ntime of plastic.
So I will do the\ncounter in plastic.
So I went to a little\nshipyard one hour from Paris,
and we did together the shape.
We shaped the counter, which\nis 11 meters long, in plastic.
And the color of this\nobject, the orange,
is coming from a fresco\non the back, which
is by Picasso, 50\nsquare meters of fresco
by Picasso in this hall.
Because this building,\nwhich had been
done by Marcel Breuer and Pier\nLuigi Nervi as the engineer,
was in the '50s And in\nthe '50s at this time,
they were doing what they\ncall the synthesis of art.
So when they were building a\nbuilding, an official building,
they were also asking to--
they were asking to\nthe artist of the time
to propose a piece of art.
So they had a collection,\na huge collection,
of the artists of the '50s.
So they have a fresco\nby Picasso, which
was orange in this fresco.
And they wanted to have seats.
So I designed, for\nmy first time, seats,
and I wanted to do it.
So I was thinking that how can I\ndeal with a collection of seats
in that huge hall.
And I was thinking\nback to the sofas
by Pier Paulin, this\nFrench designer who
was in from the '50s and\nwho died some years ago.
And he did at this time, it's\nwhat he called the snake.
An articulated sofa, that in\nthe main hall, a big hall,
they were buying\nbecause it was very
easy to make it like a snake.
So I wanted to rebuild a snake.
But I wanted to design seats.
So I started by\ndoing an armchair
with a seat and a back.
And after that, I\ndid a confidante--
that means a two-seat with\na back which is twisted,
and you can sit on both side--
and canopy, with a back and\na seat which are connected.
And if you look carefully,\nthe seats, the side,
are all the same,\nso you can mix them
and you can combine\nthem as you want.
And you can make this snake\nthanks to the confidante.
And the leather color has been\nchosen thanks to a tapestry
by Le Corbusier\nin the same hall.
And they wanted to have a table,\nso I did a plastic table, for 3
meters long with 70\ncentimeters wide,
and little legs\nand the structure,
and [? on ?] this\nis by the folds.
And they needed to\nhave a paper basket,
so I folded aluminum,\npolished in a certain way,
to confuse the perception of\nthis folds, and an ashtray.
After that, an art gallery asked\nme to do a place for storage
in this gallery.
So I proposed this box, which\nis normal by parallelpiped.
But we can open it like that,\nby sliding apart or lifting
the walls apart.
And the plaza lamps that I\ndid for the MACRO in Rome.
And I continue to\nwork with Luceplan,
and I did this pendant\nlamp, which is [inaudible]
now, because this is\nusing, with a disc
underneath, the\nindirect lighting
by using the underneath\nsurface to be
a reflector of the lighting.
And Alessi came to me once\nand asked me for a tray.
And I was thinking, OK, what can\nI do for a tray, with a tray.
So I was thinking, a rectangle,\na round, or a square?
I said, OK, rectangle, I can\nplay with more with that.
So I took--
I designed two rectangle and\nshifting one of the other,
with each of them,\nand lifting the sides.
And because those two\nrectangles have been shifting,
the sides is not regular.
So you can't take my tray\nin the middle of the side,
as usual, to bring it.
You have to take it like that.
And if to bring it like\nthat, it's much more nice.
And so I call it Alice, because\nit's Alice in Wonderlands.
What you see is not what--
What you look is\nnot what you see.
Or what you see is\nnot what you look.
Because it seems not to be\nflat, and it's absolutely flat.
And I did a fruit basket,\nto make the fruit outside,
going outside.
And oh, no, my\ngod, what happens.
I repeat that, no.
And in Gangzhou, they asked for\n15 designers to propose a lamp.
So I propose a stone\nwith a light underneath.
And I did a knife.
I have a friend who is a\ndesigner, a French designer,
with a direct-- artistic\ndirector of a knife factory.
And he called me once,\nand he said, Odile,
do you want to design a knife?
I said, a knife, why not?
And he said, it's\na folding knife.
I said, oh, I love\nfolding knives.
Because man usually\nloves folding knives.
Because everybody has\na knife in his pocket,
and this is a folding knife.
But more of that,\nthe folding knife
is a knife for the workers.
And if you are the kind\nof company of worker,
has a specific knife.
So I was thinking, OK.
But this is for table, OK.
But I was thinking after that,\nhow to design a knife when
you're an architect.
You are doing buildings and\nyou have to do a little object.
So I did a model with\nmy hand with plaster.
And after that,\nI passed my model
through the hands in the\noffice to check if everybody
was comfortable with that.
We did the model of the blade.
So it was a little\nobject like that.
And I brought to this\nman my model, and said,
this is my knife.
He said, you did a\nmodel for a knife?
I said, yes, because I did not\nknow how to design a knife,
you know.
So I did a model, and they\nbuild it, and now it's sold.
This is a very expensive knife.
[laughter]
I'm sorry.
Because it's not\na regular shape.
And the gallery where, I talked\nat the beginning, the art
gallery close to my\noffice, when I renovated,
I renovated the gallery in 2007.
And he has a dog.
And he lived with--
he was living with the dog,\nbecause the dog died this year.
But in 2007, he was alive.
And so he wanted to bring\nback the dog basket in the art
gallery.
And I said, no, a dog basket\nin an art gallery, it's
impossible.
This is ugly.
I will design a\nbasket for your dog.
So we went to visit the dog.
And we measured the dog when\nhe was standing up, lying,
or sitting.
And we came to--
we did a molded aluminum\nobject, with a mattress
inside that we asked\nsomebody to sew for Victor.
And Victor died this year.
So the house is still\nthere, but he's not here.
So I suppose I did that,\nI did to this gallerist.
So I can do that\nfrom human to micies.
And in 2013 he asked\nme for the micies.
And I did that one.
So if you want to-- if you\nhave micies in your house,
you can have my house for them.
And can I-- do I talk to my\nschool-- oh no, I'm tired.
So maybe we stop there.
No?
Or you want to talk about--\nthat we talk about the school?
OK.
[laughter]
OK, I have to drink.
I have a glass.
So this is a school.
So why to do school?
Why to establish a new\nschool in architecture?
Because, as I said, what I\nthink about architecture today,
as a culture and a\ndiscipline to help people
and to help the world, we\nhave to rethink the pedagogy
and the way to teach to you.
So young-- there are some others\nthan students in the audience,
but to the students.
I talk to the students.
I talk to the student, now.
Because you are not as us.
You are not listening we\nwere, are we are doing.
You are not memorizing\nas we are memorizing.
You are not concentrating\nas we are made concentrated.
Because you are the\ndigital generation.
And because of that,\nyou are not the same.
You are different.
I don't compare.
I don't say that one is\nbetter than the other one.
You are not the\nsame, and because
of that we have\nto change the way
we teach and you are being\neducated in architecture.
And at the same time, we have\nto take into consideration
that students today\nloves to build,
or love to do, fabricate, do\nsomething with their hands,
or whatever.
So to be able to understand\nthe way between thinking,
designing, and fabricating.
And this is very\nimportant to understand
this link, because this is\nthe only way to do something,
and after, and to--
for helping again.
And because, with architecture,\nyou can become architect or you
can become who you want.
Because doing studies\nin architecture
is educating yourself to\nunderstand who you are
and who you want to become.
Because if you\nthink that, have you
heard about this music\ngroup, music band, The Who?
Yes.
They were all architects.
The Talking Heads, they\nwere all architects.
They were all meeting in\nthe school of architecture,
and they were architects.
If you think about, Orhan Pamuk,\nhe was writer from Istanbul,
he was studying architecture.
If you think about--
there are many, many people.
If you think about\nCourreges, the fashion
designer, the French\nfash-- he was architects.
So with architecture,\nyou can do what you want.
So you have to think about that.
Architecture is more important\nthan being an architect.
And architecture\nis really the core
of the way of thinking\nand helping the world.
And because of\nthat, this is why I
think that we have to\nchange the way of educating.
And I feel a bit of\nthat in this school.
This is why I like this school,\nand this school very cool,
as I said in the beginning.
Because I know\nthat, for you, it's
normal to have a\nplace for studying,
a place for working\nwhen you are a student.
In France, it doesn't exist\nin any school of architecture.
So in my school, they\nhave places for working.
Thy have the key of\nthe school and they can
come, as you are doing there.
But is not-- is rare.
It's not everywhere.
In my school, also, they\nhave the key of the school
and they come when they want.
They can go to\nthe workshop down,
they can use the machines,\nthey can do what they want.
But as soon as they are\nresponsible, autonomous,
and able to think,\nand to create,
do things that they can help.
And they are\nresponsible, mostly.
At the same time,\nI think that today,
because when you do inquiries\nabout the young generation,
you don't want to be\nsalaries to some--
in the company.
You want to be by yourself.
So you want to become\nentrepreneur, in a way.
So we have to educate you to\nhelp you to become entrepreneur
in the world of tomorrow.
Because we are in\nthe 21st century.
My generation, the\ngeneration of your teachers,
we were happy and very lucky.
Because we were\nliving in a world
where the transformation\nwas going, was undergoing.
And we just wanted\nto push, to push
the transformation\nof the world, to push
it to go faster and further.
You, at the end of\nthe 20th century,
everything has been broken.
So the 21st century\nis to be invented.
So I'm very jealous\nabout yourself,
because you have to\ninvent a century.
And this century\nis your century.
Because you will have been\neducated for being, and being,
and living, and\nworking, and doing what
you want in that century.
So I can't believe that, so\nlucky the luck that you have,
to have a century to\ncreate, to invent.
So first to think.
So first to dream.
More important duty\nof a student today
is to dream, to\ndreams the world,
to understand what\nis coming, and to be
able to invent the world.
Thank you.
[applause]
Would you mind if we\ntake some questions?
Yes, yes, no\nproblem, no problem.
So, Odile, if we could take\nsome questions, comments.
Yeah, I mean, it's like really\ngreat to hear you speak,
and it's like really\ninspirational.
I think that we are in a\ndifferent generation now.
And I feel like with\ndigital technology
right at our fingertips\nit means that now,
like, the ability for students\nto directly concentrate
on craft and the art of making,\nis way more imperative than I
think it was in your\ngeneration, which
was about the avant garde\nand questioning everything.
And I think now, this sort\nof hardcore resurgence
in design and, like,\nthe actual object-making
is really important.
It's like powerfully\ndemonstrated in your work.
I don't have a question,\nof course, but--
[laughs]
But I think that the idea of\nmovement in your architecture
is pretty clearly\ndefined and represented.
And I was thinking about the\nultimate movement architecture
building, like the Guggenheim,\nand how it just perfectly
circulates the people.
But it seemed like,\nin your photos,
it's not really about, like,\nthe circulation of the people,
per se, so much as\nlike the architecture
itself taking on this movement.
And so like, I look at the main\natrium space of that one museum
with the, sort of,\nellipse white egg-shaped.
And you went to like this very\nclear strategy of delineating
the escalators as these\nbig clunky objects, which
I felt were sort\nof like climbing up
this sort of like\ncurvaceous object.
And I felt like that sort\nof dialectic relationship
of things acting\nupon other things
was clear in your architecture.
Yeah, thank--
Your question is?
I don't have a question.
I just figured\nI'd say something.
OK thank you.
Thank you.
[laughs]
Actually, yeah, I\nhave a question.
The, sort of, school\nyou're creating right now
is really something brand\nnew, especially seen
from the French perspective.
Could you talk a bit\nmore about the school
you're founding right now?
About what?
About, everything about it.
So just--
Everything.
[laughter]
Describe it.
You have to come.
Why is it new,\nespecially in France?
What is the new thing?
International.
Speaking and teaching in\nEnglish and French, mixed.
So everybody has to teach\nand to speak both languages.
And that is not only.
It is also about\nthe fact that we--
there are no permanent teachers.
Teachers are coming and\npeople, because it's--
I'm not there every\nday, because I can't.
And nobody is there, so\nstudents open the door when
the teachers are coming.
If I can control the system.
And they go to the airport or\nthe station, train station,
to welcome them.
They bring them at school.
Because they know that they are\ncoming because we tell them.
And they receive them.
They make them\nvisiting the school,
and after that they\nstart to teach for.
And this is not--
because people are coming from\nabroad or for somewhere else,
another place, so we\ndon't have just one course
for one hour or two hours.
We have just long system\nof long period of teaching.
So we have only what I call\nseminars, and not courses.
Because I said,\nat the beginning,
that you are not memorizing\nas we were memorizing.
So if we have a course\non whatever subject
one day for two hours, and\nso it continues week after.
In the meantime, you have\nforgotten everything.
So it's losing time.
So I prefer to give-- to\nhave three days of teaching
on the same thematic, on the\nsame history of architecture,
construction or whatever.
And at the end, the students\nare memorizing something.
And it acts-- it ask,\nalso, to the teachers
to change the way of\nteaching, because they
can't do just a\nlecture for three days,
for doing three days.
So they have to invent new ways\nof approaching, discussing,
debating, making the\nstudents understanding
what they are talking about.
And they do it.
And so, and after that we have\na workshop which are three--
one week or 10 days, and a\nlong studio for the semester.
But it's really another way of\ninteracting with the students,
that maybe you have\nit here, I don't know.
But we don't have it\nanywhere in Europe.
Because I'm teaching-- I was\nteaching in many, many places,
and I never see that already.
So we are doing that.
Because we depend\non-- we will look
at what are our students today.
And half of our students\nare from abroad,
half are from France.
And what else?
[laughs]
Hi, so earlier on\nin the talk, you
distinguished architecture\nthinking from design thinking,
in general.
I'm wondering, what\ndo you feel that--
do you feel that there's a\ndifference in the process,
when they're--
between architecture\nthinking and design thinking.
Because there is a process\nof design in architecture,
but not only.
This is why I said\nthat we have to invoke,
because we can work more\nthan-- more disciplines
that only design, that\nonly further design.
Because when-- and this\nis why, in my studio,
I want that my students\nare doing research,
and they are able to think.
They are able to\nconstruct, to build
a way of thinking, a way of\nresearching for thinking.
Taking a position, being\nengaged in a subject,
because if you are not\nengaged, and if you
don't take a position,\nyou will never take risk.
And life is risky.
You have to risk everything.
Every day of your\nlife is risking.
And doing architecture\nis taking a risk,
because you have to\noverpass the regulation.
You have to try to\ndo something more.
You have to try to give\nmore to your client.
What your client is\nasking you something,
where you have to take\nthe risk to give him more.
And this is taking risk,\nthat always in the taking
care of the budget, talking\nthe normal things, budget,
et cetera, but,\nOK, and regulation.
But sometimes, you\nhave to take the risk
to go over, to go further.
Otherwise, you only stay on\nyour place and you don't leave.
That's why I think\nthat architecture
is more powerful than design--
and the design.
At Confluence is there\na particular pedagogy,
or previous experimental\narchitecture school,
or pedagogical school of thought\nthat you are inspired by there?
I was looking at--
because it took for me two years\nto think about how to do it,
and I was looking at different\nexperiences in the world.
And but not only from\nstudents, even from my school
or little schools, and I\nwas looking at Montessori,
I was looking at\nSteiner, I was looking
at some experiences in Finland\nthat do some-- as they do,
they did, they are doing now.
I was looking about the\none, in close to Chicago,
it's a school of art.
Cranbrook?
Cranbrook, exactly.
Because I went to Taiwan.
And in Taiwan, there\nwere some teachers
from Cranbrook, who came\n25 years ago in Taiwan
and, because they were\nTaiwanese and some
are American and English, and\nthey went and they established
a school of design,\nbecause it was
forbidden for them to establish\na school of architecture.
And they were doing something\nabsolutely as I like.
Something, mixing\neverything, and students
are free to choose\nwhat they want.
It's a bit-- it's bigger\nthan what we are today.
So maybe at the end my\nstudents will be free, too.
But as for the\nmoment, is they can't.
And it was for me an example.
And they are other\nexperiences, because I
heard that there are other\npeople who are trying to--
I don't remember the\nname now, but excuse me.
After one day, I'm a bit tired.
But I was looking at many,\nmany different experiences
in the world to\nunderstand what I can do.
Yeah.
Maybe one more, maybe\nthe last question.
Thanks for sharing.
My question is, how\nmuch the French culture
influence your architecture?
Because I think you design\na lot of architecture
around the world, like\nyou mentioned about China.
So I just wonder about your\nculture root of France.
So I'm from France,\nbecause I am French.
So I think that I have\na kind of French roots.
And but every time I go\nsomewhere, I build for a place.
So whatever the place is--
and if it's in China, if it's\nin Italy, if it's in Spain,
if it's maybe in the States--
I look at the place, and\nI design for the place.
So that mean-- because it's\nnot importing an object.
It's not having an\nobject which can travel
and being established\nwhatever you want.
No, it's for a place.
And I don't know.
My roots are French, and I have\nsome specificity, certainly,
which are French.
But I don't know which one.
And I'm not with this\nneoclassical vision
of French architecture, always\nthe entrance in the middle
with symmetrical\nbuildings, for example.
I don't like that.
So I'm always on\nthe beside of that.
I always try to do\nsomething in diagonal,
because I like diagonal.
I like to go on the other side\nand to turn around the object.
And then because I was\nlooking a lot about how,
in East of the world, you\nare entering into a building
with sliding like that, not\nentering into by opening
the door inside.
I love when the\nspace is giving you
the possibility to move, and\nto walk, and to be in movement.
And because I'm curious\nabout everything,
I'm inspired by everything,\nnot only architecture.
Architecture is not\nmy only nourishment.
I look at planes, cars,\nobjects in the industry,
what happens in\nthe shops, or what
happens in the world, what is\nhappening in technology, today.
I'm curious about everything.
And I think that is\na certain quality
refers to that in architecture,\nbeing able to dream
and being able to be\ncurious all his or her life.
Odile, thank you so\nmuch for being here.
Thank you.
[applause]
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I can't believe this\nis the first time.
