Good evening, everyone.
So glad you could make\nit to this lecture.
The chair, Anita Berrizbeitia\nis involved this evening
with the [inaudible]\nVisiting Committee,
so she's asked me to introduce\nour speaker this evening,
Michael Jakob.
And I do so with great\npleasure and honor.
So just a very\nquick introduction.
In conformity with the\nconventions of the genre,
which typically allows\nfor a humility, inspiring,
and/or numbing enumeration\nof publications, projects,
laurels, and institutional\nassociations,
sometimes oddly constellated\nand at other times forming novel
intellectual geographies\nincluding, in this case,
the possibility\nof faux mountains,
first a few words about\nour distinguished guest,
[? vita. ?] A documentary\nfilmmaker and radio journalist,
philosopher and scholar,\nexhibition curator,
and editor of a prominent\njournal, COMPAR(A)ISON.
Jakob teaches\ncomparative literature
at Grenoble University and\nhistory and theory of landscape
at hepia.
The latter, hepia, because\nof, or rather in spite
of my pronunciation-- and I\nshould never attempt French
when I'm nervous or rushed,\nand at the moment I'm both--
might at first sound,\nmight at first hearing
sound like Hestia, the god\nof the hearth, of the oikos
or ordering principles\nof architecture
as such who was venerated\non the Acropolis.
Rather, hepia is an acronym.
As naturally rendered in\nHelvetic family of type,
universalizing and\nunmistakable, it
stands for the\n[speaking french]..
The highest ambitions\nand underlying challenges
internal to these\nmutually supporting fields
were examined in the\ntouring exhibition,
The Swiss Touch in\nLandscape, in which Jakob
sought to establish--
not to establish or validate\na school of Swiss landscape
architecture, but\nrather to identify
a certain general idea.
Lately, we speak and think\nmuch of natural cultures,
specifically and\nperhaps troublingly
what they once were or had been,\na tense discussion at that,
but one made so more\ncompelling in Switzerland,
a republic of four national\nlanguages, three of them
are officially recognized\nby the federation,
federal confederation,\na place Max Frisch once
called a country without utopia,\na complication of geographies
that unite in a collective\nwill to "work with necessity,"
a phrase Jakob derives from\nthe Enlightenment era polymath
Albrecht von Haller.
A more recent literary scholar\nto these remote places,
Lytle Shaw saw in the\nbridges of Robert Maillart
and the photography of the\nbrothers Harry and Bruno
[? wehrli ?] a struggle\nagainst gravity.
In [? shaw's ?]\ngenre-bending account,
the struggle is tragicomic.
As for gravitation, we\nare meant to understand
from other more reliable sources\nthat it is a universal law.
I think I've already\nprovided enough hints
while presenting Jakob's very\nconsiderable accomplishments
that some thought\nneeds to be given
to the question of the\ngeneric and the specific.
We are, after all,\ncalled tonight
to hear about the new generic.
As you'll note on the lecture\nprogram, the words in question,
like a picturesque eye-catcher,\nappear [non-english speech],,
a sign, if any, that there is\nperhaps more to it than first
appears, or perhaps less.
Literary theory, a field\nin which Michael is just
phantasmagorically\nwell-prepared and trained,
provides the most relevance,\nthough arguably not
the most comprehensive discourse\nin the general and particular.
That distinction belongs\nto botanical and zoological
semantics, in the service of\nwhich nomenclature conventions
make universal sense of the\nLatin binomial system composed
of the generic name and\nthe specific epithet.
One of its fondest\nliterary proponents
was the Genevan exile,\nJean-Jacques Rousseau,
an [inaudible].
But certainly, the best known\nof the literary critical flowers
is [inaudible] discourse in\npoetry in Samuel Johnson's
Rasselas, an epilogue\nabout happiness,
to cite the name of a\nrelatively unfamiliar genre.
The business of the\npoet, Johnson writes,
is to examine not the\nindividual, but the species,
to remark general properties\nin large appearances.
The poet does not number\nthe streaks of the tulip,
or describe the different shades\nin the verdure of the forest.
Needless to say,\nthere were dissenters
from Johnson's prescription\nof these features, which one
poet may vigilantly remark upon\nand another carelessly neglect.
William Blake, most\nnotably, disdained
this latter platonic\ntheory of perception.
"To generalize is to be\nan idiot," he exclaimed.
"Particularize is alone\ndistinction of merit.
And this all\nsublimity is founded
on the minute discrimination"
George Saintsbury, the\nliterary historian and wine
connoisseur-- and I think that\nlatter attribution somehow
matters in this context--
was more measured\nin his response.
But despaired of the\npotentially leveling effects,
we are off to sacred heights now\nif the poet must, in his words,
"consult the laziness and\ndullness of his readers
by merely portraying prominent\nand striking features."
Such an accommodation\nwould rather
rule out poetic strangeness.
It would rather make convention\nand familiarity the keys
the poetic kingdom of heaven.
Who am I to say,\nbut entering heaven,
which is said to be above,\nshould not be that easy.
What I can say most assuredly\nis that Michael Jakob was not
Samuel Johnson's man.
He is vigilant, careful,\nbut also, more importantly,
a creative and playful\nobserver, every marker,
to use Johnson's phrase, a\nphenomena, capturing not only
that which is apt\nto be overlooked,
but also finding what no\none else thought to look for
and making his recorded\ndiscovery as fresh as the new
found thing in the world.
To read his most recent book,\nThe Bench in the Garden of 2017
is to recognize instantly and by\nturns what a gifted storyteller
he is, which is what any\nengaging interpreter hopes
to be.
What is the new generic?
Is it merely the newness of\nit that makes it particular?
Can the generic in\nitself be specific?
I can't wait to hear.
So I will take my\nvery unbench-like seat
in the audience and invite\nMichael Jakob to the podium.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Thanks.
[applause]
Thanks a lot for the invitation.
The general idea of\nthis presentation
is a rather simple one.
And it's a straightforward one.
Can we speak today of the rise\nof a new generic in landscape
architecture and,\nmore generally,
in the planning disciplines?
Are we faced to an\nongoing standardization
with the result of a\nmore uniform landscape?
Does contemporary design\nproduce a banal reality?
And if so-- and I really\nbelieve that at least partly,
it's the case--
for what reasons?
And should designers\nreact to it?
And should we educators react\nto it as the world around us
becomes more uniform?
My idea is to put it\ndifferently and to say it
right now that we are,\nindeed, confronted
with the strong and negative\nimpact of a new generic that
fabricates an increasing\nnumber of extremely similarly
designed landscapes\neverywhere around the world.
The terms we use in order\nto describe the world
are, however, never neutral.
And they need some form\nof initial explanation.
Banal, ordinary, uniform,\nuniformity, standardized,
generic, the same, sameness,\nhomogeneous, there is a lot,
there exists a lot of\ndifferent categories
which we can use to describe the\nphenomenon I'm interested in.
Banal, for instance,\noriginally from French, banal,
common to all, means so\nlacking in originality
as to be obvious and boring.
Generic is that which\nis not specific,
lacking imagination or\nindividuality, the original,
if you want.
Ordinary is something with\nno special or distinctive
features, the normal.
The ordinary is not\ninteresting or exceptional.
It is commonplace.
Standardized is something\nthat conforms to a standard.
Sameness means lack of variety,\nuniformity, or monotony.
This extremely rapid\nsurvey shows us
that there is a system\nwhich implies both value
judgments and\nformal criteria when
we deal with the\nphenomena I have in mind.
We could organize it by a\nstrictly dualistic system
of propositions--
original versus unoriginal,\nvariety versus monotony,
interesting versus boring,\nspecific versus common,
individuality versus standard,\nspecial versus commonplace,
distinct versus uniformity,\nexceptional versus ordinary,
and so on.
The term I find\nmost interesting,
at least in order to\nbegin with, is standard
because it relates not only\nto a noun, but to a verb,
to standardize.
I don't want to start with\nmoral or aesthetic or formal
criteria, but with\nstandardization,
given that it suggests\nat the same time
a process, a general framework,\nand a historical background.
Let's initiate therefore\nwith the last element,
a brief survey concerning\nthe history of standards
and standardization.
Standardization begins, as\nwe know, in Great Britain
with a small object, the screw.
The first national\nstandard worldwide
was the one regarding this\nscrew thread in 1841 stating
thread angle of 55 degrees.
Joseph Whitworth, the promoter\nof the British Standard
Whitworth, or BSW,\nwas so successful
that the British railway\nadapted his system.
Standards go from the tiniest\nscrew to railway systems
and then to the English\nStandard Committee
founded in 1901, that is, to\nthe first industry standards.
From the beginning,\nstandardization
is, however, not limited\nto the production
of industrial objects.
It is rather a process of\narticulating and influencing
technical knowledge.
Multi-disciplinary by essence,\nstandardization touches several
aspects at the same time--
economics, politics, science,\ntechnology, labor, business,
and even culture.
If we consider\nunits of measurement
as another essential\nelement of standardization,
we get aware that it touches\neven our Weltanschauung,
the way we actually\nlook at the world.
As for measurements,\nwe should not
forget that [? condicere, ?] the\nFrench ideologist of the meter
and of other standardized\nunits links standardization
with the French Revolution\nand the idea of rationality
shared by everyone.
This is the original meter\nin Rue de Vaugirard in Paris.
Another aspect we have to\ntake into consideration--
and I'll come back\nto it later on--
is the almost\nimmediate application
of standardization to the\nmost advanced technologies
of communication.
We can easily trace a\nline from the development
of the global\ntelegraph standard,
and a very important instrument\nof British imperialism,
to the railroad system\nand to electricity
and to the contemporary\ninternet standards.
Standardization is,\nhowever, never neutral.
On the contrary.
Think of standardization\nof, for example,
an industrious-- or here if have\nsome examples of the railway
system and\nstandardization becoming
more and more important\nwith the railway system
and what happens when things\nare not so much standardized.
And standardization\nis never neutral.
So it thinks of\nthe standardization
of industrial parts in American\narmories for the production
of muskets, for example.
And once standardization\nbecame a major trend
in the 20th century, the\ndanger of the application
of mass production to\nbiology, for example,
very well suggested in Huxley's\nBrave New World where, I quote,
he speaks about\n"standard men and women."
Or we could think here again\nstandardization of mankind
or think about Westworld and\nthe perfect cyborgs and so on.
A relatively recent example of\na successful standardization
is the container.
Containers existed already\nin the 19th century.
But standardization\nreally became important
in the 20th century.
While the first international\nstandard was adopted in 1933,
the new ISO standard,\nwhat are now
usually 40 foot or\n12.2 meter containers,
was imposed only after an 1960.
This kind of centralization\nraises, of course,
no real questions.
The disappearance of differences\nand of variety in containers
is no problem.
But it's, rather, the\nsolution of a problem.
If it comes to objects\nwhere aesthetics matter,
things are, however,\nmore complicated.
In an important book\nfew people read today,
The Shape of Time by George\nKubler, it was, I think,
Robert Smithson's\nfavorite book, Kubler
puts up a very interesting\ntheory of things.
His main idea is that objects\nexist always in series.
The series begins\nwith prototypes
which permit the development\nof different models.
And then the series lives on\nuntil, at a certain moment,
the series comes to an end.
The series of\ncontainers, for example,
start in the 19th century.
And once the international\nstandard was adopted,
every possible development\ninside the series
comes to an end.
Let's come now to\na second way to try
to enter the problem\nof standardization,
so the relation between\nidentity and difference in three
fields relevant for\nlandscape architecture.
What about difference, variety,\nindividuality, first of all,
in architecture, then in\na history of the city,
in urbanism, and,\ncertainly, in the
built environment in general?
Dealing with architecture\nat the very general scale,
we could speak of\nstandardization or uniformity
by highlighting several aspects.
Take the formal\nuniformity of buildings,
the reproduction of almost the\nsame form in time and space.
Examples could go from the\nclassical and neoclassical
architecture to the\ninternational time style.
It is typical, for instance,\nnot to recognize immediately
the age of neoclassical\narchitecture.
Normally, when we see\nthese examples, we
always-- we say they\nall look the same.
Another example\nof uniformization
is the use of the same material.
Still another one is\nstylistic uniformity.
Here the results\nare so standardized
that the general\npattern works rather
as a model than a real type.
Still another aspect\nconcerns production,
constructions built by applying\nthe same standard procedures.
Quite often, all these aspects\nexist parallely and overlap.
Think, for instance, of\nthe infamous Plattenbauten,
or large paneled\nsystem buildings
of the former East Germany.
Plattenbauten, a type\nof building consisting
of large, prefabricated\nconcrete slabs,
became, after a [inaudible]\nproject in Berlin in the 1930s,
the standard methods is\nto build the [inaudible],,
the new development\nareas of the country.
The architects of this\nkind of social housing--
we could make, rather\nsay antisocial housing--
developed subtypes\nwith poetic names
like P2, WBS 70, or WHH GT 18.
Models that marked,\nfor several decades,
a general impression of\nGDR's urban landscapes.
Here you see the material.
And here you see\nthe result. Or here
again, you know, these\nextremely standardized places
in the former German\nDemocratic Republic.
Here again.
But I ask myself if the\ndestruction of Pruitt-Igoe,
the famous urban housing\nproject in St. Louis,
Missouri in the mid-70s--
you remember that Charles\nJencks always says postmodernism
begins with the\ndestruction of these,
of Pruitt-Igoe cannot be read\nas a reaction against uniformity
as well, besides the well-known\nproblems there of poverty,
crime, and\nradioactivity and so on.
Here you have the famous image.
After this first negative\nexample, we can now, of course,
think of some positive examples.
At least, take for example,\nthe British city of Bath.
Bath, celebrated\nas a particularly
beautiful and picturesque\ncity and the only British city
recognized as a\nWorld Heritage site,
owes its celebrity\npartly to the uniformity
of its material, golden\ncolored local sandstone,
and to the form of\nits identical facades.
The effect of repetition\nintended by architect John Wod
was understood as\nparticularly fitting
for a disposition responding to\nthe roles of classical decorum.
One could, of\ncourse, immediately
add to these examples\nthose of [inaudible],,
of many gated communities,\nor anonymous urbanizations,
of sprawl scapes, and of\nmany other sites marked
by an extreme sense of\nrepetition and uniformity.
Here again, examples of--
whoops.
What about the quality of\ncontemporary sprawlscapes--
the one which we saw before--
compared, for example,\nto Olmsted's Riverside?
What happened between Riverside\nand our contemporary urban
landscapes and sprawlscapes?
Let's remark before continuing\nwith the architecture
that the existence\nof these patterns
raises almost immediately\nsome fundamental problems
of aesthetics, of psychology,\nand even of ontology.
Does the work of art has\nnecessarily to be unique
in order to please?
For Walter Benjamin,\nfor instance,
the historical\nsituation changed once
with the Industrial\nRevolution and the possibility
to reproduce the same object\ninfinitely once the work of art
lost its aura.
Erotic objects have a strong\nidentity and individuality,
while post-erotic object\nlacks such a quality.
Or is Kant's right when he\naffirms that works of art
touch us by their form\nrather by content or idea,
that the form of this\nbuilding, that it's always
the form of this building\nwhich touches us independently
of the other factors?
Naturally, I will\ncome back to the sum
of the idea of standardization\nand the political impact
of standardization raised\nalready by Benjamin.
But there are other\nexamples which
we can cite when we look\nfor a definition of order.
Think of, for example, of Ernst\nGombrich's The Sense of Order.
Gombrich speaks about an\nalmost anthropological
or universal need\nfor regularity.
And he thinks that at\nthe level of our most
fundamental perceptions, we\nare always order-oriented.
But is the role of patterning\nor responsiveness to pattern,
really universal or\nrather the result
of an order-oriented ideology?
We know that Gombrich\nborrows his sense of order
from Karl Popper.
And Karl Popper insists himself\non the role of schemata.
So does this mean\nthat order is simply
something inborn, is\nsomething natural for mankind?
Or is it, on the\ncontrary, an idea
of the 18th and 19th century\nwhich becomes fundamental
only in the theories\nof these people?
Jay Appleton, for\nexample, adopted this idea
in landscape studies\nwhere he thinks that when
we recognize a certain\npattern of landscape, we--
it's always recognizability\nof this landscape
which makes that, which\nraises in us positive feeling.
Is an urban landscape\nenhanced by uniformity
or is uniformity the best\nexample of urban beauty?
There is, of course,\nanother aspect
which is fundamental\nin Kantian aesthetics,
is the sense of autonomy,\nthe autonomy or individuality
of the work of art.
From the 18th century on,\nindividuality, originality,
uniqueness becomes\na central value.
And normally we expect now\nfrom things that please
us a high degree of uniqueness.
And the same objects we\nloved a moment ago become--
don't please us\nanymore if they lack
originality or individuality.
Let's add to this\nfirst reflection
a second layer, introducing\ntwo new categories--
the banal and the ordinary.
Ordinary is something\nthat lacks originality,
versus the extraordinary\nwhere originality immediately
calls for our attention.
Things that are\nbanal should not be
confused with ordinary things.
Banal is that which\ndisappears in its context
without necessarily\nbeing ordinary.
Something ordinary doesn't\ncall for our attention as--
something ordinary does not\ncall for our attention as well.
But once we observe\nit, we remark that it
is isolated in its context.
The opposite of something banal\nis, for example, a monument,
a construction that\nrequires-- as in the case
of the extraordinary--
our attention.
The French architect\nAugust Perret
was one of the\nforemost advocates
of a banal architecture.
For him, the banal\nwas not the ordinary,
but [non-english speech],,\nthat which seems always having
already existed.
A banal architecture is one\nthat one doesn't remark,
an architecture that, at least\nat the first time, disappears.
Perret would claim that his Le\nHavre buildings, with their 6
and 24 meter scheme, are\nbanal, but never ordinary.
Another aspect of positive\nbanality in architecture
is the use of new\nbuilding methods.
Le Corbusier, for instance,\nwas proud of using
a general constructor for\nhis La Tourette monastery
who just did the job.
It was a constructor\nwho normally built dams
in the Alps.
So the making of the\nconstruction was banal,
but the result\nwas extraordinary.
And Le Corbusier, as\nwe know, he really,
very often liked to affirm\nthat God liked symmetry.
And we see the trace of\nthis in his urban visions,
like the [inaudible],, where\nan extremely standardized,
with its extremely\nstandardized building types.
There are still\nother factors we have
to think about when\ntrying to define
the horizon of our inquiry,\nstandardization or homogeneity.
One essential element\nis the introduction
of samples or catalogs,\nfor more or less
standardized architecture.
The history of this\ngenre from the pattern
books of the 18th century\nto the manuals and programs
of the Beaux-Arts style,\nto contemporary catalogs
where you can choose the\nstyle of your building
is still to be written.
There are a few studies\nabout the influence
of the standardization.
And I think this would be, would\nbe very important to see how
standardization, both in\narchitecture and in urbanism
and in other disciplines has\nreally a starting point in many
of these publications.
Even in this famous photograph\nof the Beaux-Arts Society
in New York, we see that\nthe top of the buildings
is, well, naturally individual.
And it's a skyscraper,\nas we know,
but the base is still\na very common language.
We could cite, at the same time,\narchitects who powerfully tried
to work against\nstandardization like Adolph
Loos and his famous\nVilla Moller,
for instance, where we see\nthat Loos was always extremely
critical of standardization,\nof homogeneity,
both in the eclectic\nstyle and in what
we called the modernists.
And sometimes he went\nso far that he even
complicated infinitely\nthe function
inside his constructions\nin order to build something
extremely individual\nand completely
against any possible standard,\neven if some of these solutions
seemed to not to be logic.
Given that architecture\nalways exists in a context
and that the main context\nis that of the city,
the problem of\nstandardization and uniformity
can only be treated\nin the vaster
framework of the urban fabric.
Even a very brief\nanalysis of the dialectics
of uniformity versus\nvariety in the urban context
confronts us immediately with\na very complex phenomenon.
Let's not forget, first of all,\nthat for Virtruvius, uniformity
was an essential value\nnext to firmitas and all
the other values, even if\nhis sense of uniformity
has more to do\nwith symmetry than
with architectural sameness.
The Vitruvian\nsense of uniformity
reminds us, however, of\nthe quintessential category
of order.
The importance of order\ncomes from the Greek ideal
of cosmos, that is, the\nwell-ordered universe.
For the ancient Greek, we\nlive in a perfectly ordered,
finite totality, built by the\nfirst mover or first architect,
the supreme god if you want.
The seven planets,\nthe seven winds,
and many other sacred\nentities, marked always
by the number of\n4, 7, or 10 express
the harmony of the universe.
That utopic projects\nof the perfect cities
of Renaissance, for\nexample, [inaudible]..
Here you see the four\nelements, so the four elements
as general structure or\norder of the universe.
These ideas will\ninfluence, for example,
[inaudible] ideal city, and\nmany, many other projects
of ideal city, ideal cities\nthroughout the Renaissance.
It is, however, only in the\n19th century that order--
the term order is, of\ncourse, polysemic-- becomes
the key concept\nof city planning.
[inaudible]\n[? haussmann's ?] Paris
is probably the starting\npoint of an operation
that still influences\nthe design of many cities
around the world.
He received the city of\nParis, the [inaudible] of City
of Paris, the body of city\nof Paris being transformed,
being destroyed by [? baron ?]\n[? haussmann, ?] his architects
and landscape architects and to\ndestroy the old organic Paris
in order to transform\nit into something new.
[? joao ?] [inaudible],,\nfor instance,
he understood immediately--
maybe he was the\nmost lucid observer
of this transformation--
and he showed how the old\norganic Paris, [inaudible],,
was transformed into something\nmechanical and marked by order.
And Baron Haussmann's project\nat the same time militaristic
with the boulevards,\nhygienistic and economical,
created the cityscape marked\nby highly uniform [inaudible],,
standardized boulevards,\nsquares, and so on.
From the second half\nof the 19th century on,
stressing the importance of the\nvisual uniformity of the city
became a fundamental goal.
The new cityscapes\nhad to be legible.
And this was not only\nthe case in the center,
but in the margins\nas well, as well
as in the new standardized\nsuburban districts.
Order and uniformity\nbecame, at the same time,
the condition or, if you want,\nthe synonym, if you want,
of modern beauty.
The French even invented\nthe professional figure
of the [inaudible].
[inaudible] from\nLatin, [inaudible],,
the controller of the roads.
In 19th century\nParis, especially
in [inaudible] Paris,\nthere was this figure,
the [inaudible] who had to\ncontrol, a sort of inspector,
he had to control the roads and\nbuildings, squares and facades
that corresponded to\na general standard.
The uniform cityscape,\nwhich survives
in our contemporary urban\nrealities marked, for instance,
by condominization becomes\nvisible in Fritz Lang's
Metropolis.
Lang is, by the way,\nvery much aware--
very much aware of the\npolitical implications
of an urban pattern\ncharacterized
by almost total uniformity.
His deconstruction of a\ndangerous European utopia
highlights the contradictions\nof two conquering systems
with a strong tendency\nfor uniformity.
There is, on the one hand,\ncommunism and its desire
to create unique and highly\nstandardized urban patterns.
We saw the Plattenbauten before.
You have architecture\nand people standardized.
And on the other hand,\nthe capitalist system
with the power for\ntechnologies is
equally interested\nin standardization,
primarily not for political,\nbut for economic reasons.
This is a general\nbackground we have
to keep in mind if\nwe want to remind
those voices throughout\nthe 20th century that
called for a critical\napproach of uniformity, order,
and homogeneity.
Bruno Zevi, Architectura\nOrganica, Organic Architecture,
published in 1945, can\nserve as a first example.
Zevi, who founded the APAO,\nAssociation for Organic
Architecture,\ncriticized frequently
the excessive of tautology\nin contemporary architecture.
The principal aim\nof his criticism
was what he termed\nfascist architecture.
Fascist architecture is\nindifferent to the social needs
and forgets, quite often,\nthe most elementary functions
of the building.
It is characterized by\nsymmetry or an excess
in symmetry, symmetry for the\nsymmetry's sake and proportion.
Most of the buildings\nZevi had in mind
looked like boxes, [inaudible],,\nstatical [inaudible]
entities with no\nrelation whatever
to other buildings and the\nimmediate surroundings.
20 years later, Aldo Rossi\npublished L'architettura della
citta, the architecture\nof the city.
Rossi interprets the city\nas an architectural totality
and as a main scene of\nall human activities,
he further underlined that\ncities realize themselves
thanks to the idea they have\nof their own development.
It's a very idealistic\nidea, a neo-Hegelian idea
of the city building itself.
Dealing with individuality\nin the urban context,
Rossi stresses\nthe essential role
of monuments versus all\nother mainly functional
constructions.
"A monument stands at\nthe center," I quote,
"it is usually\nsurrounded by buildings
and becomes a place\nof attraction.
Monuments are always\nindividual, highly individual,
while all the other\nconstructions are not."
Let's take a source,\nfamous source
for an advocacy for the\nindividual or non-generic
in the urban context.
Kenneth Frampton's\nhighly influential paper,
Towards a Critical Regionalism.
Frampton starts with a citation\nby the French philosopher Paul
Ricoeur, worried about the\neffects of universalization
civilization giving rise\nto a mediocre civilization.
Ricoeur regrets\nthat with, I quote,
"we find everywhere\nworld the world
the same bad movie, the same\nslot machines, the same plastic
and aluminum atrocities."
And I would add today myself,\nthe same urban landscape,
the same plazas, the same\nsquares, the same streetscapes,
and so on.
The contemporary lack\nof quality in urban form
is, according to Frampton,\nin part predetermined
by the imperatives\nof production.
Confronted to the victory\nover universal civilization
or what he calls the\nburolandschaft cityscape,
we should carefully opt for\na variant of regionalism
being capable to combine\nthe local and the universal,
the individual and the abstract.
Critical regionalism\nas a lucid form
of resistance and\nculturist strategy
could be the solution\nin order to mediate
between universal civilization\nand specific, local elements,
providing a synthesis\nbetween world culture,
diversity, and universal\ncivilization, identity
imposed by the system.
Frampton calls, on the one\nhand, for the desconstruction
of world cultural intended\nas a catalog of forms
we have learned to mix,\na sort of mixed salad
architecture or mixed salad\nurbanism or very eclectic.
And he invites us,\nat the same time,
to face critical\nuniversal civilization,
especially when we rely\ntoo heavily, too heavily
on technology.
Before I come to landscape\nand landscape architecture,
let me mention still another\nrelatively recent theory.
The French philosopher and\nanthropologist Marc [? auge ?]
has highlighted during\nthe last two decades
a phenomenon identified by\nhim as non-lieux, non-places.
In opposition to places that the\nspatial entities that oriented
mankind until very recently\non a worldwide basis,
well-identified places bounded\nand with a strong identity,
hypermodernity, he speaks about\n[french] develops more and more
highly standardized realities.
If Auge starts like Frampton\nwith a positive model
of bounded places,\nhe nevertheless
stresses that even these\nplaces are in reality,
are in reality social\nand mental constructions.
Places, lieux, have\nthree main qualities.
They provide a\nsense of identity.
They are relational,\nthat is actively related
to other places,\npart of a system.
And they are historical.
They have a minimum\nhistory which confers
to them a sense of stability.
Non-places, on the other\nhand, have no identity.
They are non-relational.
And they exist in a\nsort of timeless bubble.
According to Auge, our\ncontemporary civilization
produces an increasing\nnumber of non-places.
With non-places, he intends\ntwo related phenomenon.
One is a certain\ntype of such places,
places linked to the transport\nsystem-- for example, airports,
train stations, gas stations--
or to commerce--\nshopping malls--
or to the tourism industry--\nhotels and restaurants.
The other thing which his\ninterest is our attitudes
towards these places.
When we actually find\nourselves in these non-places,
we never really experience them.
We're never interested in\ntheir identity or history.
They have no history or form.
We just use them.
We're simply there, but\nwe could be anywhere else.
It doesn't matter.
Contemporary tourism--\narguably the first the industry
worldwide--
contributes to the dissemination\nof even more non-places,
ex-territorial spots\nwhere we don't really
have any experiences.
The anti-utopic quality\nof these insular places
becomes even problematic\nif we consider the fact
that most of them are linked to\nprivatization and to security.
These appear on\nthe happy islands
of the atmospheric\ncapitalism are in reality
spaces of total control.
And a culture of\ncontrol has, as we
can add, in its turn,\na clear influence
on how these places are\nplanned, built, or landscaped.
With a final result that\n[non-english speech]..
So the non-places\ncreate a sense--
they never create a sense\nof individual identity
or relation, but\nsolitude and sameness.
A counter example, for\nexample, for the non-places
cited by Marc Auge would be\na gas station like our friend
Nader Tehrani's gas station in\nLos Angeles or a shopping mall
or a commercial center\nlike James Wine's BEST.
So we could imagine\nother ways to define it.
Let me now go a step further\nand look for a moment
to similar phenomena in\nthe field of landscape.
At first hand, landscapes\nseems the opposite
of all these realities\ncharacterized
by standardization,\nuniformization, sameness.
Landscape, perceived\nlandscape is by definition
a place of land, a piece of\nland or nature seen by someone
at a certain moment.
It is, in order to use\n[inaudible] formula,
time flowing into space.
Landscape is, therefore,\nalways radically singular
and individual.
It is unique.
It is always this one\nlandscape in front of me.
The English poet Coleridge\nwho toured the Lake District
around 1800 and tried to fix the\nsingularity of the landscapes
perceived was always desperate\nbecause of the impossibility
of finding the right words\nfor his unique impressions.
I cite, "The Head\nof Glen Nevish, how
simple for a painter\nand in how many words
and how laboriously and\nin what dim similitudes
and how slow and dragging\ncircumlocutions must
I give it?"
He complains, "Oh,\nfor words to explain
how slate and limestone lies.
Silly words, I\'m\nvexed with you."
Impossibility to\ntell what is singular
and given only in a moment.
Dealing with landscape,\nwe can, nevertheless,
arrive to this\nopposite finding too.
Landscape experience is\nnever immediately given,
but the result of very\ncomplex cultural processes.
We learned, in order\nto put it differently,
to identify a series of\nparticular landscape patterns
and with it so only from\nthe 18th century on.
Take, for instance,\na picturesque.
In order to recognize it,\nour ancestors of just two
and a half centuries\nago had really
to learn its new language.
People like the\nfamous Reverend Gilpin
actually developed a catalog\nof landscape patterns.
And it is in search for these\nextremely similar landscapes
that the tourists of the\n18th and 19th century travel
tend to--
had to look out.
See, there was a whole industry\nof these publications, books
so picturesque landscape\nhad to be explained in order
to be seen.
It's not naturally given--
and people naturally to\nreacted to [inaudible]
other of Gilpin's publications.
Another instrument used in\norder to create similarity
is a Claude glass.
By using it, the traveler has\ncombined the formal identity
provider by the scopic device\nwith a stylistic identity
of a well-defined\nlandscape type.
Here you see Claude glasses\nin the British Museum,
Gainsborough using\nhis Claude glass,
or today's Claude\nglass, if you want.
This is our contemporary\nClaude glass.
So we fabricate landscapes.
And we learn to do\nthis and very recently.
The reality of the impressions\ndiscovered in the world
out there correspond to a global\nand highly Eurocentric model.
That is, landscape painting,\nof the landscape painting
of the 17th century,\nespecially the landscape
paintings of Claude Lorrain.
In reality, the range\nof pleasing landscapes
is quite narrow.
And it privileges repetition\nor the recognition
of the-- recognition of the\nsimilar patterns and aspects.
We learn to appreciate\nthe bucolic, the romantic,
the sublime, the\nwild landscape thanks
to painters like Claude\nLorrain and many others
of the 17th century.
British travelers, for\nexample, of the 19th century,
before the 19th\ncentury were never
interested in the British\nlandscape in its individuality.
They, rather, went to\ncontrol if the beauty
of the British\nlandscape corresponded
to the classic beauty which they\nknew from the Italian models.
So, in general, travelers\nof the 18th and 19th century
organized their tours\nby mentally identifying
and photographing\nextremely similar--
photographing in their\nminds-- extremely similar
standard landscapes.
The second effect of\nthe aesthetics of nature
had even more\nstriking consequences.
The pictuary style applied\nto gardening and to landscape
architecture went so far as to\nproduce on site an increasing
number of landscapes that\nlooked very much the same.
Worlitz in Germany looked\nlike Ermenonville in France
or Stourhead in Britain.
And they all looked,\nmore or less,
like a painting\nof Claude Lorrain.
You never know where we are.
So you're picturesque.
At first sight, we\nthink these are very,
very highly exceptional\nplaces, very
individual with their owners and\na nice, very complex programs.
But if you start\nto analyze it, you
see that it's almost the\nsame image coming back
again and again.
So from Kent and Brown\nto Repton and Olmsted,
and up to our days,\nwe're faced with the fact
that we build landscapes\nthat have to be close,
that have to be very\nclose to a general model
in order to please.
My point here is\nthat a certain degree
of perceptive and\ncultural standardization
is characteristic for\nlandscape experience in general
and that in dealing\nwith uniformity today,
this has to be waved\nagainst this tradition.
So standardization\nprobably always
existed in the\nlandscape experience.
Take, for example,\nTuscany, Tuscan landscape.
Tuscan landscape as we see it\nand we love it more or less
today is an invention\nof the British tourists
of the 18th century.
Before this kind of\ntrees were not used.
They were used\nmostly in cemeteries.
So this is a\nstandardized landscape.
But today, it is taking as the\ntopical landscape of Tuscany.
Naturally, with time,\nnew categories appeared.
And especially in\nthe 19th century,
there were many other\naspects of standardization.
I don't have the\ntime to enter this,
but, for example, the invention\nof the national landscapes
in the 19th century--
the French, the\nGerman, the Italian--
they invented their\nnational landscapes.
And then they tried to keep--
try to make everything possible\nthat the national landscape
or something identified\nas the national landscape
had never to change.
I will come now to\nlandscape architecture
and to another way to\nspeak about the problem
of standardization,\nanother way to confront it.
Naturally, I will\ntry to give you
some examples concerning\nstandardization in today's
landscape architecture.
But before coming to,\nit there is something
which I always like to mention.
Landscape architecture\nis a strange discipline.
It has existed\nnow for 250 years.
Arguably, it starts with\nHumphrey Repton, 1789.
It's the year of the\nFrench Revolution too.
And it's his business card\nwith a very pragmatic sense.
Every time he found a client,\nhe immediately gave him
this business card.
And he calls himself\na landscape gardener.
So let's say our\ndiscipline existed now
for two and a half centuries.
And the strange thing is\nthat landscape architecture
has almost no history,\nvery difficult
to find a history, a\ncomplete history of landscape
architecture.
Not very strong\nin theory either.
And even the corpus of landscape\narchitecture is not so clear.
So I had the chance\nto travel a lot
around the world with this\nSwiss landscape architecture
exhibition.
And I liked always to ask\ncolleagues, to tell me,
what is your corpus?
I mean, what are 10\nworks which really count?
And even most of them stopped\nat three or if there were--
colleagues who were in\nthe business, world,
they would cite their own work.
Well, this is another work.
But it's very difficult.
So I always say, it's a\nvery strange discipline.
Where if we were in--
I don't know painters--
we could agree, there were some\npeople like Van Gogh and Monet.
And they had some talent.
So we won't start again.
But in landscape\narchitecture, no one
knows what is the corpus?
What is the standard?
What is-- where do we come from?
So this makes it even difficult\nto make presentations.
I mean, what do we speak about?
What is landscape\narchitecture, anyhow?
So I think it's-- it's\nsomething we have to take
into consideration.
So and maybe-- and this is\nlinked to my topic-- maybe
this has an effect\non homogenization
and standardization.
Because landscape architecture\ndoesn't have a clear corpus,
we don't have a\nprogression, take it however
in what sense you want.
But there is not\na clear history.
So very often, we are\ndealing with repetition.
The same forms come back again\nand again and again and again.
And we would like to ask\nsome of our colleagues,
didn't you see that there\nwere some guys like Sorensen
or some other guys who\ndid some good work?
So you should look to people\nwho work before you, but no.
So this is-- I think\nthis is a real problem.
It's not the problem I\nwant to deal with today,
but I want to mention it.
So what about difference,\nindividuality,
and a culture of difference\nin landscape architecture?
So my main example\nI will try to--
I took one example by\nour friend Paolo Burgi.
I think you know his work.
And this is Cardada\nin Switzerland--
in the southern part, in the\nItalian part of Switzerland.
And I like to show it\nbecause I think it's--
it's a polysemic object.
I don't think we have so many\npolysemic objects in landscape
architecture.
So what do I mean by\npolysemic objects?
I will try very, very rapidly\nto give you just an idea of what
I take as a polysemic\nobject, something
which is many things at the same\ntime and marked by difference.
So this is an\nobservatory in the Alps.
There is a first\nplatform and then
there is a second platform.
And Burgi built it.
So this is a beautiful platform.
And the starting\npoint for Burgi was
what happens when\nyou go into the Alps
and you're confronted\nto a place where
you will experience\nsublime landscape
and you'll see\nsomething extraordinary?
And his idea was well,\nwe have to do something
which is not built out,\nwhich is not ordinary,
which is not generic.
He wanted to do\nsomething exceptional,
but at the same time,\nbeing full of respect
for the local elements.
Here you see the context.
It's on Lago Maggiore, not very\nfar from the city of Locarno.
And when he started to\nwork on this object,
he was very much aware\nthat there is a context.
It's a Swiss context, too.
You know, Kenneth\nClark said this
is the first painting in\nEuropean landscape painting
and maybe in European--
landscape painting\nall together where you
can recognize a certain place.
It's a Bay.
It's Lake Geneva.
And you see [inaudible] behind.
And so there is a history\nbehind the discovery
of Alps in general and\nof alpine landscape.
And we have many,\nmany important steps.
And when Burgi started\nto work on this project
to build the platform\nwhere you have
a dialogue with the\nalpine landscape,
he knew that the mountains were\nhated until the 17th century,
that they were interpreted\nas the place of the devil
and of, generally in a\ncompletely negative way.
And only in the 17th century,\nthings started to change.
And then in the 18th century,\nthey become something sublime.
This is Caspar Wolf.
And Caspar Wolf made a very\nimportant career showing us
the sublime quality of the Alps.
So when Burgi\nbuilt his platform,
he related himself to the\nhistory of the sublime
and to the history\nof, we could say,
the modern subject, which\nlike to go to these places
and to elevate\nhimself and to see
the world from upside down,\nwhich was something almost
revolutionary.
But, naturally, Burgi\nworked at this project
in the 20th century.
And there is a history of the\nview of our scopic relation
to the world, which is\nmarked by our desire
to look from upside down.
And in the 20th century, for\nexample, aerial photography
became extremely influenced.
This was a photographer\nand a pilot.
He pretended that he would\nboth photograph and pilot
his plane at the same time.
I think it's impossible with\nhis cameras which were barely,
20 kilogram camera.
But still, he was extremely\npowerful and influential.
And so there is a history\nof our way to see the world
and to relate our world, to\nthe world through a vision.
And Burgi creates this\nplatform by relating
to many, many things.
For example, this is\nhow in the 19th century
our view from the\nmountains was organized.
You see these platforms,\nthese belvederes,
which was very typical.
Quite strange that\nalready people
thought that it's\nnecessary when you arrive
at the top of the mountain\nto have something,
further step to go even higher,\nto have this last step, which
gives you the ultimate\npossibility to conquer,
really, site.
And you see how tourism\norganized this already
in the 19th century\nand how it became
almost a ridiculous something.
So what is-- if\nyou go to the Alps,
you will find hundreds and\nhundreds of these places.
They're quite sad, very\nbadly built, extremely banal,
I would say.
And Burgi wanted to make\nsomething very different.
And I think it's really\nthe depths of his knowledge
which transformed this project\ninto something polysemic.
For example, he knew very well\nthe tradition of the panorama,
of panorama.
When Barker invented\nthe panorama quite early
at Leicester Square, he\nshowed some panoramas
of the mountains.
He remembered that the\npanorama, the idea behind
Barker's project was, there's\nso many people who cannot afford
to travel and even if\nyou can afford to travel,
it's dangerous.
And why use your\nmoney for traveling?
And I will show you the world\nand you come into the panorama.
And panoramas became\nvery, very influential.
And they influenced\nlandscape architecture
and many, many\nother disciplines.
And so people went\ninto the panorama
and then they could have a\n360 degree view of the world.
So Burgi tries to do\nsomething very different.
That's what he had not in mind,\nthese sad constructions, which
we find in the Alps.
And he wanted to do\nsomething poetic and complex.
He was beware of the--
almost the\nresponsibility to do what
happens if we arrive\nto such a platform.
How do we look to the world?
And at the same time, he\nwas attacked by some people.
They said, you're a\nlandscape architect.
You like nature.
And why do you use concrete?
And what about concrete here?
And he said, no\nproblem with concrete.
I think I can live with it.
And there is a\nhistory of concrete.
And concretes are stone.
And stone is my theme.
Because here we are\nin an important place
where two geological\nphenomena, the African
and the European\nplate, comes together.
You see the same landscape,\nbut actually the mountains
are very different.
Because one of the--\none mountain range
is 380 million years\nold and the other one
is 120 million years old.
And as the two--
the African and European\nplate, they touch each other.
That's why we have so many\nearthquakes in Italy and so on.
And he tried to explain this by\ntaking some samples of stones.
And he integrated this\ninto his platform.
So you'll see it's very-- it's\nnot very rhetoric, rhetorical.
It's very simple.
It works with citation\nand with other elements
in order to let us\nenter into this place.
And I think was very\nmuch aware too about what
happened in the Alps,\nand not only in the Alps,
throughout the world.
So in the 19th\ncentury, we destroyed
or transformed almost all of\nour traditional landscapes.
And this is the price, you know.
These are the wonderful five\nstar hotels in the Alps.
So you could here,\nas a bourgeois,
sit there at the old balcony\nand enter into relation
with wonderful landscapes.
But that's the price of the\ntransformation, an extremely
brutal transformation\nof the alpine reality.
And it continues.
For example, we have these kinds\nof platforms and this kind.
And that's what he\ndidn't have in mind.
And I think the\ncomplexity and the scale
and the almost the poetic\nquality of his platform
is really the result\nof a cultural approach
of how you project this.
And naturally, he\nwas very much aware
of the discovery of the\nmountains and of landscape.
You remember Petrarch.
Sometimes we read that Petrarch\nwas the first modern man.
Jacob Burckhardt said this.
And that Petrarch\ndiscovered mountains
when he went to [inaudible].
So the discovery of\nlooking from upside down
is something very specific.
And it has a history.
It's not given for in every\nculture and at every moment.
It's a cultural possibility.
And then take the round\nform, the circular form,
why did he choose it?
I don't think he had\nSorensen in mind,
but we could think of\nSorensen's [inaudible] and
of [? noguchi ?] and\nof many other examples.
I think the round\nform has something
which we'd call agorotic.
It's like a forum.
And therefore, to build his\nobservatory in this way is--
there are many, many,\nit's like a poetics
of citation and suggestions.
So I create something that\nlooks very, very simple,
but it's not simple at all.
And another idea\nbehind Cardada was--
well, this is something which\nseems only to float, floating.
And the idea floating,\nyou know, in Rem Koolhaas
it's so important.
And the idea of architecture,\nthis starts already with
[? burle ?] and\nmany other people,
[? ledoux ?] in\nthe 18th century,
architecture as an elevation\nand the desire to almost float
above the world.
And then the relation\nto stones and to rocks
and the aesthetics of rocks.
This is, by the way, a painting.
It's not a photography.
So I think he had a\nvery keen sense of,
what do I want to keep\nand how do I want to work?
And there are many other stories\nand many other [inaudible] too.
I'm sure many of you know\nPaolo Burgi's Cardada.
So they're iconic\nsigns integrated.
And they have something\nto with history and time,
especially philosophy of time,\nthe very long geological time,
hundreds of millions\nof years, our time,
and the time when you come\nas a visitor and you stop by.
Or this is Monte Verita,\nvery important place
in around 1900 where\nartists, anarchists
from everywhere to Europe\ncame to this place in Ascona.
And they developed modern\ndance and poetry and art
and et cetera.
And it is not very far\naway from Cardada either.
So all these themes come\ntogether in Cardada.
And at that place,\nhe built a fountain.
And this fountain, you see,\nhe wanted to build himself.
And here you see the fountain.
And that's how he choose it.
So that's the history\nof this fountain.
And that's, again, the\nmaking of the fountain.
And that's making of\nthe fountain again.
And then it will\nbe installed there.
So it's something very\nindividual, very particular.
And he spent a lot\nof time to find
the right place and the right--
the right material.
So it's something\ncompletely individual.
And later it was destroyed and\nso he rebuilt it another place.
And one of the starting\npoints of my idea
to speak about standardization\nwas that Paolo is working now
in Geneva at the CERN.
And he works on--
there is a tram here.
And so it's an urban project.
And here you see the plan.
And he wanted to\nbuild a bench here.
And he told me, it's impossible.
I cannot build my bench.
So he wanted to\ndraw a bench like he
drew the fountain before.
And he said, it's impossible.
Because they asked\nme to do benches,
to buy benches in a catalog.
And he said, it's not only\nabout standardization, so,
but it's about certification.
He said, if you don't have\nthe right certification,
then you cannot go on.
And so he had to--
so he couldn't do it.
And it's these kind of\nbenches he had to choose.
So they told him, if you\nwant to have a bench,
we'll give you a catalog.
And it's almost impossible\nfor him to design it,
even in Switzerland.
You know, in\nSwitzerland, we're not
even in a European community.
So we're a very free country and\nwe're very proud of being free.
But it doesn't work\nanymore for many reasons--
certification, standardization,\neconomic reasons.
So this was--
I think this is a\ngood example of what
I mean by standardization and\nthe impossibility of being
original.
Then another example,\na contemporary example
is square in Milan, Piazza\nGae Aulenti, quite recent.
And Piazza Gae\nAulenti is, for me,
an example of a really, very,\na sort of international style
in landscape architecture\nor in urban design.
It was quite a poor quality.
And you see we\nare here in Milan.
But we could be very easily in\nBerlin too on Potsdamer Platz.
And by the way,\nthe Italian journal
said, oh, Milan is\nbecoming now like Berlin.
So they said, finally\nMilan became like Berlin.
So you see how something\nwhich maybe for some people
is something extremely\nnegative, on the contrary,
it was celebrated as well.
We too, we have these new urban\nplazas which are wonderful.
And you see here.
And if you look to it,\nit could be everywhere.
So it's a sort of\nDubaization of Milan.
And this Dubaization, you\ncan find it everywhere.
You see, it's horrible.
I mean, it's a sort\nof urban nightmare.
And people even celebrate it.
They think, wow, it's full of--
and you see no life here, eh?
So they celebrate it, but\nstill, there are some problems.
And then, again,\nPiazza Gae Aulenti.
And you see-- no,\nlet's go back here.
You see the solar tree.
But this solar tree is\nreally something terrible.
I mean, it should be forbidden.
And it's not [inaudible]\n[? stephens' ?] revolutionary
solar tree of 1925,\nyou know, which
was really a scandal, which\nis something poetic, and which
is a provocation, and which\nis many things together.
No, it's really these kinds\nof horrible solar trees.
They should forbid it.
I mean, they're a tree.
We still have trees.
So why solar trees anyhow?
And so you see the\nstandardization in solar trees.
So that's how Piazza\nGae Aulenti works.
Or, for example, I was\nin September in Morocco.
And another standardization, you\nsee the whole lighting system.
You see in the whole country,\nthe same lighting system
everywhere.
So you see the same\nlamps everywhere.
Probably it's a wonderful\nbusiness for the one guy
who does this in\nthe whole country.
But for the whole\ncountry as a totality,
it's an extreme standardization.
And so we go towards\npoor solutions.
Or this is a wonderful\nand completely ironic
faux palm tree.
So now the telephone companies,\nthey hide their antennas
with palm trees.
And you find it everywhere,\nhundreds or even thousands
of these things.
So this, again, is\nstandardization.
So we have in landscape\narchitecture and urbanism,
generally standardization\nis so powerful.
And we have to ask ourselves,\nwhere does this come from?
Why are we confronted with this?
Naturally, there are standards.
And more and more\nstandards become important.
And we have in the US,\nyou have these standards.
But I think it's more--
the whole situation is more\ncomplex, far more complex.
It's linked to globalization\ntoo and to some corporations.
Take, for example, if we\nlook to the important, really
important international\narchitecture firms, et cetera.
Or do you think SOM\nis very proud of this?
I mean, this very--
this is the main example\nfor what they do, huh?
And probably, I think they're\nreally happy about this.
But it could be, you\nknow, this [inaudible]
could be everywhere.
Or if you take AECOM, you\nsee again, it's a plaza.
It could be everywhere too, very\ndifficult to say where we are.
Or here again, you\nsee where are we?
And why do all these\nplaces look the same?
So maybe before coming to\nreally the final remarks,
how can we interpret\nlandscape architecture?
And how can we interpret the\nurban reality all together?
So as you heard,\nI deal sometimes,
I still deal with literature\nand comparative literature,
even if I'm mostly now\nin landscape architecture
and related disciplines.
But I will make a short\ndetour by literary theory.
Because I think what interests\nme is, who is responsible?
Who is responsible\nfor standardization?
Who is responsible\nfor standardization
in architecture?
Who is responsible\nfor standardization
in landscape architecture?
Who is responsible in general?
And I think we need to identify\nsomeone who is responsible,
at least to start to think about\nhow to understand the world.
So if you take literary\ntheory, very, very quickly,
in the 18th and 19th\ncentury, everything
was about the author.
So we had the figure\nwhich was the author.
And the author\nwas always someone
who was the author in the\nvery enthusiastic sense.
So think of the parks of\nthe 18th and 19th centuries.
They're full of these sculptures\nof Edgar Allan Poe and Pushkin
and Tolstoy.
So it's the author.
And what does the author--
well, the author,\nhe writes something.
It's a text and a novel,\nfor instance, or a poem.
And so the author, there is\na causality between the two.
The author writes a poem.
A composer composes\nmusic, and so on.
So the author is\nresponsible for something.
So there is an author.
And we can take him\nfor responsible.
But at the same\ntime, hermeneutics
in the 18th and 19th\ncentury said no.
Everything which,\nEvery discourse
is a result, not only of\nan author, but of a system.
Take, for example, poetry.
Well, when you write a\npoem, you choose a sonnet.
And the sonnet\ndoesn't belong to you,
but it belongs to literature.
And it belongs to a\nsystem of literature.
And in the system\nof literature, you
have the system of\nlanguage, and so on.
So every discourse is\nboth a result of an author
and the result of a\nsystem at the same time.
And then Kant comes\nin the 18th century.
And he says, there is\nsomething which we could call
the autonomy of works of art.
Once a work of art exists,\nit doesn't belong to anyone.
Once the architect finishes\nhis building, it's a building.
And it exists like a poem.
And it's-- well, he goes\non to do other stuff.
And so it's autonomous.
And you have to interpret\nit on its own basis.
And this is the autonomy.
Very important idea comes back\nin the new criticism where
they say, don't\nrely on the author,
don't rely on the system,\nrely on the discourse itself.
And so the author is something\nyou have to be careful of.
The author, anyhow,\nwe don't know anything
about the intentions\nof the author.
And an author is\nsomeone who is living.
It's far too complex to\nspeak about intentions.
And but there is autonomy.
And the system,\nsometimes you have
to be careful with\nthe system too.
And then, in the 20th century,\nwe have structuralism.
And what do I mean\nby structuralism?
Well, if you want to\nunderstand the discourse,
you have to understand\nit on its own terms.
So it's what we\ncall reflexivity.
It means that every object\nwhich we produce, especially
in culture, has to be\ninterpreted on its own basis.
So every novel is the\nimplicit theory of itself.
And every building,\nimportant building
has an implicit\ntheory of itself.
And this is structuralism.
It means in order to\nunderstand that the discourse,
you have to understand\nits structure.
And this became quite important\nwith the Russian formalists
and many, many other people.
And then came\npost-structuralism.
And they said, the\nauthor doesn't exist.
We think that there are people\nwhich we call authors, someone
who wrote the book,\nbut it's never
the author who writes\na book, but it's
the system which writes books.
Because the system\nis something which--
you find it in [inaudible]\nand in many people--
they say there is a general\nsystem of literature
and of the language.
And it's much\nstronger as an author.
You think you're the author,\nbut you're not the author.
You think you're the author,\nbut there's so many constraints
that you're not author.
And then so the actor\ndisappears almost.
And then in the 20th century,\nUmberto Eco and [? wolfgang ?]
[inaudible] and\nmany other people
said, well, there is\nsomeone who is lacking here.
It's the reader.
And there needs to be\nsomeone, the spectator.
And so now, finally,\nwe have a theory
where we take all\nthese things together.
So why do I speak about this?
Because I think it's\nan interesting analogy.
Because we can ask ourselves--
ourself, what happens when we're\nconfronted to standardization?
What happens when we deal with a\nwork of landscape architecture?
Who is the author?
And how strong is the author?
And naturally, we can\ngo from a weak author
to a very strong author.
Sometimes we have strong\nauthorship, even in urbanism.
Think of Niemeyer\nand Lucio Costa
when they designed Brasilia.
It's strong authorship.
And in many other cases, the\nauthor almost disappears.
And then we have the system\nwhich can be very weak
or it can be very strong.
And then the reader.
Well, the reader\nor the spectator
is normally extremely weak.
There is a tradition of\narchitecture and, I would say,
of planning generally that\nthe consumer, the user
doesn't really count.
I mean, we're still\nin a tradition
of architecture and planning\ngenerally as production.
And we're very happy when\nthe production is solid
and when it's well done.
And once we finish it,\nonce we finish a building,
once we finish a square, once\nwe finish a project, well,
we go on to the next one.
So we're never interested in\na real life or what [? jane ?]
[? dixon ?] calls the afterlife.
But we're just in the\nlogic of production.
And [inaudible] the\nreader or the user
is always the poor\nguy in this triangle.
And we have to ask\nourselves, if we're
dealing with standardization\nand homogeneity, well,
where does it come from?
Does it come from the system?
Does it come from the author?
What happens or is\nthere happening--
what happens here?
So I think this model\nis a very simple model.
And it's an extreme\nsimplification of many things
which became extremely\ncomplex in literary theory
in the 20th century.
But it's-- I find it an\ninteresting analogy in order
to ask, who is responsible for\nall this, for standardization?
Who's responsible for the\nquality and the non-quality
or the lack of quality\nof today's spaces?
Who's really responsible?
And, well, I'm afraid that\nall these things will become
a little more complicated with\nwhat I called here the BIM uber
Alles or the super\nBIM or the hyper BIM.
You know that now we\ngo from BIM to LIM.
And landscape information\nmodeling is somewhere there.
And I think things may become\nworse and more problematic.
And I was three weeks\nago in a strange place,
College Station in Texas.
But the good surprise, besides\nthe fact that many students
were armed, so it was a\nbit surprising for me,
even if in Switzerland, we\ncan buy arms very easily.
But there my\ncolleagues told me, be
careful what you say\nbecause many of our students
come with their Smith & Wesson.
So I was-- but I\nwent to their lab.
And I saw the biggest BIM cave\nof the world, so 120 degrees.
And Julian Kang is\nbuilding now 360 degree--
no 300 degree BIM cave.
And naturally, it's\nreally fascinating.
And there is a story behind\nBIM linked to standards.
But in a perspective\nof cultural history,
well, I was amazed\nconcerning what happens here.
Because it's\nsomehow, it's almost
a promise to replace the world.
I think it's both a very old\nhistory and something very new.
Probably we're still in the\nBrunelleschian invention
of modern space.
And this is 16th century.
How people imagined that\nwe can rationalize the idea
of the great or what\nthe Italians call
the [non-english speech],, so\nhow we can rationalize the size,
the view of the world.
So I think the BIM\nand the BIM cave
are representations of a\nway to see the world which
was born in Europe\nin the 15th century
and starts with Brunelleschi\nand many other people.
And then it became this link\nbetween technology and vision.
And one of the examples\nis natural landscape.
I think the landscape\nview comes from here
and from the 15th century.
So this is a BIM cave.
And here you see the grid.
And it's used in the--
back in the 17th century.
But the BIM cave\nor the hyper BIM
we'll have in two or\nthree years, well,
it has to do something\nwith the panorama too.
Because this is the panorama\nin Leicester Square,
Barker's panorama.
And the promise to see the world\nand these were these panoramas,
you went to Leicester\nSquare and you
could see Paris or\nJerusalem or any other town
or any other reality.
And the new BIM,\nwell, it's really
the promise of a\nfull of possibility
to enter another world,\nwhich is our world.
And this will mean that\nfor planners and landscape
architects and architects,\nit's even easier
not to have any real contact\nwith the world out there.
And it becomes even a reality.
This is in Estonia\nwhere people are
very proud that this was done\nwith the last BIM technology.
But at the same time,\nyou see it's panorama.
So how-- and it's naturally\na shopping center.
So how all these\nthings come together--
standardization, BIM, and so on.
And, of course, the\nthing which comes in mind
is Plato's cave because\nthe BIM cave is a cave.
And well, you\nremember that Plato
argues that we'd\nnever see the world,
but we actually\nsee only shadows.
And so I ask myself,\nwhat do we see?
What kind of perception,\nwhat is the influence
of all this new\ntechnology on perception?
And do we see the world\nor do we see only shadows?
So probably the things I'm\nmost interested now is,
how do all these\ntechnologies transform
our perception of the world?
And I think that's where\nwe have to start when
we deal with these phenomena.
Thanks for your attention.
[applause]
Thank you Michael for that\nincredibly generous talk.
And I want to turn directly\nover to the audience.
I know Michael's very happy\nto receive your questions, so.
Please.
Thanks.
I was wondering about\nstandardization in the past.
And I think that, for example,\nin like a medieval European
town as well as in\nHaussmannian Paris,
or something there is\nalways standardization.
So within that, like Siena, for\nexample, all of the buildings
will be built using the\nsame tectonic logic.
And I think it's true\naround the world in a way.
So now that the zone of\nawareness for the people
is global due to\ncommunication technology,
is there any-- do\nyou really think
there's any way to\nstop standardization
without stopping communication?
Well, two observations,\nfirst, you spoke about Siena?
Yeah, well, Siena is\ninteresting because I
don't think it's standardized.
If you look to the\ngood government,
you know, the painting\n1350, you will see that this
is a portrait of the city.
And the city portraits\nitself, very interestingly.
And all the houses\nare different.
And there is a\nsense of difference,
and I would even say a sort\nof pride in difference.
So the reality of the European\ncity in the 14th century
is identity through\ndifference and by difference.
And you have poor\nhouse-- you have
some houses which are very\nrich people and some are
poorer people.
And it's almost programmatically\nabout variety in Siena
And it's quite late,\nI think it's really
in the 18th and 19th century\nthat the idea of uniformity
comes up and that it\nenters the urban space.
So I think it's extremely\nrecent and probably
linked to some ideologies.
And your second observation,\ncan we stop standardization,
can we avoid standardization?
I don't know.
I try to understand\nwhat happens.
So I think I'm interested\nat first in analysis
and try to see, what are the\nphenomena we're confronted?
And it's not easy because\nall these values--
that's one of the ideas\nI tried to express--
is that all these oppositions\nare extremely ideological.
So and especially when we\ndeal with landscape, so
our landscape\npatterns and what we
define as beautiful landscapes\nare always very much influenced
by ideology.
For example, people don't\nlike to hear about this,
but 20th century\nlandscape architecture,
there is a history, a\nvery important history
linked to ideology\nand especially
to far right ideology.
Take, for example, [inaudible]\n[? hamburg's ?] famous
[inaudible],, his book where\nhe speaks about the good
that the bad landscape.
And you see that a certain\nidea of organic landscape
can be interpreted very\neasily as the ideological idea
of some philosophers of\nthe 19th and 20th century.
So I don't think we're--
I think it's far too dangerous\nto think we are against,
we're for standardization,\nwe have to stop it,
we don't have to stop it.
I'm interested in saying,\nwell, we are confronted to it.
And let's understand\nwhat happens.
And let's see, in some cases,\nwe may react against it.
And in some cases,\nit may be OK too.
So I don't think it's far too--
maybe we can do some\nintelligent criticism
once we understand\nthe phenomenon
in its full complexity.
But we're not there.
And so it's the same with BIM.
So I went to this\nlaboratory because I
was interested in the\ncritical impact of BIM.
So I work now on a project, how\ndigital perception transforms
our interpretation of the world,\nand especially in studios.
So we have a project ongoing\nwhere we go into the studios--
architecture studios,\nurbanists, landscape architects.
And I'm interested how\ndrones, programs, satellites,
everything, Google Maps,\ntake everything together,
how the digital\ntransforms the perception,
so that actually people\nsee the world differently.
And so I'm interested\nin these phenomena
before trying to judge it to\nsay I'm against it or for it.
Yeah, thank you so much.
I'm really interested in the\nterm generic as you use it
and maybe to expand your, as\nEd said, very generous lecture.
Many of the examples you used\nto define landscape architecture
seemed to either put it in a\nposition of framing landscape
or viewing landscape or\nmore contemporary examples,
you're looking at items,\nobjects, hard materials that
almost sit on or seem to\nalmost decorate the landscape.
Whereas myself as a\nlandscape architect,
I think generatively\nof landscape
as moving earth and planting\nmaterials and hydrology
and the very stuff of\nthe planet, if you will,
and not the stuff that\nsits on top of the planet.
So I wonder if you\nmight be able to talk
about the generic\nvis-a-vis landscape
architects in this missing\ncanon, which I couldn't agree
more with you about, such\nas [? browers ?] in Holland
or Capability Brown\nin England or Olmsted
in the United States, whereby\nland itself was the design
medium.
So the generic in landscape\narchitecture, in the history
of landscape architecture?
Yeah, vis-a-vis moving\nland, moving and be--
and inhabiting the actual\ncultural landscape as opposed
to the view of an existing\nlandscape or the positioning
of the viewer in terms of\ncontemporary landscape,
which your examples used--
viewing platforms, solar\ntrees, and vulgarities
of patterns, which I\ncouldn't agree more.
However, it's\nmaybe not the stuff
of the very landscape itself.
Well, the first idea\nwhich comes to mind
is that in the 18th century,\n18th and 19th century, well,
you have all these people who\nmove earth as you say already.
Take Repton or Morel.
Morel, who, by the way, an\nengineer of the [inaudible]..
And he became the first\nFrench landscape architect
around 1800.
But the result they had\nin mind was almost always
something extremely generic.
You remember when\nthe [inaudible]
says if as a landscape\narchitect you
want to work, you have to\ncreate a tableau, a painting.
And it's a sort of\ncomplete immobility.
And it has to be\nrecognizable, because it
has to correspond in\nsome way to patterns
which you know from painting.
So actually what they created\nwere living paintings.
And they used all the\nmachinery and shrubs and trees
and everything.
But the result had to be static.
So there is a\ncontradiction there
because the\nAnglo-Chinese garden,
or picturesque garden\nstarts with the philosophy
of moving around and\nfreely creating the reality
where you walk.
But at the same time,\nthe ultimate sense
of a picturesque garden,\nit was the recognizability.
So the possibility to,\nas you said, to frame it
and to freeze it.
And if you didn't have frozen\nlandscapes, that is, paintings,
living paintings, then\nyour garden had no sense.
So I think that's\none of the ways
that standardization\nworked back in the 18th
and then in the 19th century.
In contemporary, well,\ncontemporary landscape
architecture is more\ndifficult because,
as you said, what\ndo we speak about?
So we should start\nto have a corpus.
And who does landscape\narchitecture?
And who are the authors?
And what is-- there is a field\nwhere landscapers and urbanists
and planners-- well, who is the\none who transforms the world?
So what happens in these places?
But I think another\nthing I'm interested in--
I don't answer, but still--
another thing I'm\ninterested in--
or I answered only half--
is the history, the influence\nof software in the last 20 years
on the form, the\nGestalt of architecture
and of landscape architecture.
So what happens,\nhow strongly did
software and the\nrecent software really
create certain realities?
What happened there?
And so what I\nwould be interested
in is, how does everything\nwhich is digital actually
create the reality\non the ground?
And with BIM, it's fascinating\nbecause, naturally, we
can say it goes\nreally from the screen
to the machine to the 3-D\nprinters and everything
and to the production.
So I think we go\none step further.
Because now-- while in\nthe 18th and 19th century
the result was 2D, it\nwas a nice picture,
it was a beautiful\npicture-- now it's 3D.
So you go from 2D to 3D.
Yeah?
Perhaps this is more another\nthought on what you presented,
particularly on the last--
on that little diagram that\nyou are talking about--
the system, the\nforces, the publics.
And I'm wondering if in the\npresent context, if it makes
sense to rethink\nabout the forces
that are producing this generic.
Because exactly these landscapes\nthat you're looking at,
beyond the form and\nthe effects, they
are the result of\ncertain capital demands,
issues of marketing, issues\nof creating a certain image.
So I'm wondering if you have\nfurther thoughts on expanding
the conversation about the\nsystems and the constituencies,
the stakeholders\nthat are generating
these images of landscape\nor perhaps if this
could be a good moment to bring,\nto unpack what system may mean.
Yeah.
Yeah, probably the sort\nof systemic approach,
so going back to what\nwe call the system would
be important because,\nas we all understand,
author and authorship\nbecomes weaker and weaker.
And the reader or spectator\nbecomes weaker and weaker.
And the one reality which\nbecomes almost overwhelming
is the system.
But if we start with--
we have to define what we-- when\nwe talk about the system today,
it's very different than\nwhat the structuralists
and the post-structuralists\ndefined the system back
in the end of the 20th century.
So probably, is digital system,\nfor example, a possibility,
to say that we have a sort of\nauto-referential digital system
which has become so powerful\nthat it doesn't need us
at the moment.
So even we as designers\nwill disappear forever.
And the system will design the\nworld without any need of us.
And this would be a sort\nof totalitarian system
which produces--
even our desire will\nbe controlled by it.
So I think this is probably\none of the directions one
has to inquire.
But I wouldn't have a system\ntheory, a ready-made system
theory which I could cite\nin order to apply it.
But certainly, yeah, maybe\nif you think about system--
in hermeneutics, the\nsystem was the language.
So because probably the\ninventors of hermeneutics
thought that the language\nis the most general way
to define all the discourses.
And language brings\nus back to rhetorics.
So probably, there is a sort of\nrhetorics of the system which
is extremely powerful today.
And the rhetorics\nwould be a sort
of non-written conglomerate\nof implicit rules
which actually shape the world.
So I would-- one of the\ndirections I would look
into is a return of rhetorics.
So that's one of the\nideas I would have.
But I don't have\nany other answers.
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks for your\nextremely generous lecture.
It was really fascinating.
And Q&A sessions is great too.
My question relates,\nI think, to how
you concluded the lecture,\nwhich in my experience,
the conclusion that you\nprovided seemed a little,
a little depressing in a way.
And I'm wondering if\nthat was your intent
or if you think that digital\ntechnologies, BIM specifically,
could perhaps usher in\na new age of, say, even
returning to Brunelleschi and\nhis model of the Florencian
dome and using the model and\nnot the two dimensional drawing
as the means to generate\narchitecture or landscape
architecture.
Whereas now, you know, you\nmake your fancy Revit model,
but you still produce a\ntwo dimensional drawing.
You still hand that to\na construction team.
You are still-- you still have\nthat two dimensional to three
dimensional abstraction.
Whereas, potentially\nwith augmented reality,
you could just live in the\nmodel and design in the three
dimensional and build in\nthe three dimensional.
Is that a positive development?
Would you see a return\ntowards non-standardization
through the ability of the\ncraftsman to potentially
have more influence\non what's being built,
more use of local materials,\net cetera, because you're not
abstracting to the\ntwo dimensional,
but producing a document set?
I don't know.
Yeah, well, first of all, I\ndidn't want to depress you.
And I don't want to sound\nlike an old professor.
You know, already\nPlato, you remember
he said, oh, now all these\npeople start to read.
It's the end of culture.
It's horrible.
Because before\neverything was oral.
And everyone had an\nincredible memory.
And now all these young\npeople, they are all--
all these hipsters, they read.
So it's horrible.
It's always the end\nof culture for--
so I don't-- I'm not interested\nin a sort of straightforward
criticism of our tools.
I think it's like people\nare crying about internet
and everything becomes poorer.
I don't think so.
We have to use it\nin intelligent ways.
So this is clear.
And that's why the link\nwith Brunelleschi, probably
there is something very\nBrunelleschian and extremely
intelligent in\nthese technologies.
But still, they are an\ninterpretation of the world.
They're not the reality.
So it's a very, very\npowerful tradition.
And many people like\nBenyovszky, et cetera
have said probably the\nstrength the extreme power
of the Brunelleschi model,\nin order to simplify,
is because it's an extreme\nsimplification of the world.
If the world becomes\nmathematical and geometrical,
if I can control it, I\nhave a rational model.
And it's so powerful\nbecause it becomes universal
because it's so\npowerful, but it's not
the true model, et cetera.
So when you speak about\nthe local and craftsmanship
and other things,\nI can speak only
about the quality I saw in many\nlandscape architecture studios.
And probably, this is something\nvery real, I would say.
And even as students,\nwhat I say to my students,
you have to be at the same time\nextremely rapid and extremely
slow.
And to be extremely\nrapid means you
have to use all the devices\nwhich you have today.
And you have to be the\nstrongest one when you use them.
So you have to know everything\nand to use everything possible.
But at the same time, you\nhave to close your eyes
and you have to take your time.
And to take your time\nmeans to, probably you
have wonderful ways to use all\nthese technologies of today.
But maybe the next day\nyou go back to drawing,
something which you draw.
And I think many\nexamples show us
that probably the compromise\nbetween slow and fast,
technological and\nsomething which you do,
but I believe a lot in the\nintelligence of the hand.
And because I think it's\nnot only about what you draw
and what you do with your\nhands, but it's about time.
You take your time.
And when you take\nyour time, it means
you reflect, so your reflection.
And I think there is a distance.
And when you have a\ndistance, well, then you
look differently to\nwhat you produce.
And the danger of everything\nlinked to machines,
to the digital is that you\ndon't have the distance anymore.
And so probably, we have\nto be, at the same time,
organic and mechanic\nand fast and slow,
but certainly not depressed.
Festina lente,\nmake haste slowly.
Will you all join me in\nthanking Michael Jakob
for this beautiful lecture?
[applause]
Thanks.
