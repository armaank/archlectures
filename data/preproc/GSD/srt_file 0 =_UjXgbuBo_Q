It's really wonderful\nto see so many of you
here, especially after seeing\nsuch a great group of people
here for Sou Fujimoto--\nvery different,
probably, audience, very\ndifferent presentation.
But to see so many wonderful\npeople here for Bruno,
it's really great.
As you know, Bruno\nLatour is here
as our Senior Loeb Scholar.
Every year, we invite a\nSenior Loeb Scholar who
spends about a week with us.
And this is organized\nthrough the Loeb's office
with John Peterson.
Sally, the whole team\ndo a wonderful job,
and they meet and spend\ntime with the Loeb's.
And in fact, this\nweek Bruno is also
spending time with the MDes\nprogram, with John May,
and some of the students\nwith Anita Berrizbeitia.
So the idea is that the\nSenior Loebs are basically
engaged with the\nlife of the school,
and they don't just\ndo one lecture,
but we really benefit from\ntheir ideas and their interests
in different kinds of contexts.
This program has been going\non for a number of years.
And some of the\nother Loeb Scholars
that include Ulrich Beck, Arjun\nAppadurai, Katherine Boo, David
Harvey, and others.
Before I introduce\nBruno, I also want
to take a minute to let you\nknow that this Thursday,
October 18, the\ncurator Jose Esparza
will speak in\nStubbins at lunchtime.
He is the newly minted Executive\nDirector and Chief Curator
at Storefront for Architecture.
And he will start on November 1.
Landscape Architect and Option\nStudio Faculty Member Marty
Poirier will give a lecture\non Monday, October 22.
And on Tuesday, October 23,\nour next Rouse Visiting Artist
Lecture of the semester features\ncurator Julieta Gonzalez,
and visual artist Fritz\nHaeg, and Nils Norman.
They will be in\nconversation about Haeg
and Norman's recent\npublic art commission
to design a plaza at the\nMuseo Jumex in Mexico City,
and the event will\ntake place at 6:30 PM
here in Piper Auditorium.
In light of last week's\ndire climate report issued
by IPCC, the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change,
it feels really apt and timely\nto have Bruno here tonight
to lecture on Gaia politics\nand the conceptual idea
of the seven planets.
Bruno is no stranger to the\nGSD, and indeed, to Harvard.
He's been working here,\ncollaborating with colleagues
like Peter Galison in\nthe History of Science
for many years here at the GSD.
He's been involved on\na number of occasions.
We had a wonderful event here\nwith him and Peter Sloterdijk
some years ago.
And then we also collaborated\non the beginnings
of what is now our Master\nin Design Studies in Art
Design and Public Domain.
Because Bruno at that time,\nhe was at Sciences Po.
And he was also very\ninterested in the relationship
between what he called the\npolitical arts in France,
and really having people\nwith the background
in the social sciences,\nor maybe design,
coming in to Sciences Po to\nstudy for a Masters that really
prepared them, in\na different way,
to address the question\nof the political arts
in the context of Sciences Po.
I think one of the key\nreasons why many of us
are very keen on having Bruno\nhere is because he's really
a sort of worldly public\nintellectual, who thinks
about philosophy, anthropology,\nand other disciplines,
but with a very\nworldly perspective.
And more and more,\na lot of his ideas
have had connections to the\nway in which he's already
thinking about the planet,\nwhat's happening to the planet,
and our actions, our\nresponsibilities,
and what kind of\nthings can we do.
It doesn't always directly\ntranslate to design,
but I think it has many\nconsequences for us
in the context of\na design school,
where we're really thinking\nabout these broader issues,
where his work is very much\nabout the interrelationship
of things, and the impact that\nthings have on each other,
including humans and non-humans.
One of his-- well,\nhe has also published
so many amazing books.
And I think we want to hear\nfrom Bruno very quickly.
But one of his probably\nbetter-known books--
most of them are very well\nknown-- is the book called
"We Have Never Been Modern,"\nwhich was really an earlier
book.
But I think it's good\nif I read you maybe even
the first paragraph from\nthe back of the book,
to just give you a\nsense of how some
of his thinking in relation\nto science is formed.
He says, the book says,\n"With the rise of science,
we moderns believe the\nworld changed irrevocably,
separating us forever from\nour primitive, pre-modern
ancestors.
But if we were to let go\nof this fond conviction,"
Bruno Latour asks, "what\nwould the world look like?"
His book, An\nAnthropology of Science
shows us how much of modernity\nis actually a matter of faith.
And I think there is a\nvery beautiful description,
in the sense that for Bruno,\nit seems words and themes
like alchemy,\nastrology, phrenology--
they are also part of\nthe very conceptions
of the pre-modern, which\nmaybe we should not
let go of so quickly.
And therefore, I think\nit's really interesting
when you think about the idea of\nus being able to sort of think
through issues or design in\na way that doesn't bracket us
in a very precise\nway, and excludes
other notions, other\npossibilities, and so on.
As I said, Bruno\nspent a lot of time
at the School of MINES in\nParis, and then subsequently
at Sciences Po, where he was\nresponsible for research,
and set up the program, the\nMedia Lab and the program
in the political arts.
We're really, really delighted\nthat he's here with us.
There's a lot more to be said,\nbut would you please join me
in welcoming Bruno Latour.
[applause]
That deafening silence\ncoming from the White House
after the new report\nfrom the IPCC--
as Mohsen just\nmentioned-- two weeks ago,
urging the United\nNations to try,
no matter how hard\nit appears to be,
to keep the global temperature\nbelow the Paris Agreement
target of 1.5 degrees can be\ninterpreted as another proof
of anti-science attitude.
But for the last\nthree years, I've
been more and more convinced\nthat the continuous, coherent
and deeply entrenched climate\nskepticism of the Republican
Party should be seen as\na mark of a great design
in geopolitics, namely\nto redesign the United
States as situated\noutside of Earth,
and moving toward another\nattractor altogether.
What used to be a lame joke--
"But my poor fellow, you seem\nto live on another planet,"
has become the strange goal\nof a new form of geopolitics.
Yes, indeed, we do intend\nto live on another planet.
Cultural historians would\nsay that the US has always
been somewhere else than\nthe rest of the world,
and certainly away\nfrom the Old World
and meshed into it's\nold, outdated attachment,
and that it was constructed to\nbe a land of nowhere welcoming
anybody--
I mean, once the\nearlier inhabitants
had been dispossessed, that is.
But this out-thereness, or\naloofness, or special destiny
was figurative only.
It remains symbolic, as\nin the myth of a city
on the hill, another\nsuch pretension.
Today, it has become literal.
Everything in\npolitics happens as
if a large chunk of the planet\nwas moving somewhere else
than the rest of\nthe world, hoping
to benefit from another\nclimate, and not
to be submitted to the same\nforces of Nature as, let's say,
China or Indonesia.
Prior to recent US\nproclamation, when
historians talk\nabout geopolitics,
they meant different nations\nwith opposite interests
waging wars on the same\nmaterial and geographical stage.
But today, geopolitics\nis also concerned
with wars about the very\ndefinition of a stage itself.
A conflict will be called,\nfrom now on, I propose,
"a planetary relevance,"\nnot because it
has a planet for the stage, but\nbecause it's about which planet
you are claiming to\ninhabit and to defend.
And to register this\nshift in meaning,
I use the word\nGaiapolitics, since I've
been trying over the years to\nresurrect the Lovelock-Margulis
discovery of Gaia, a discovery\ngains great importance today,
in my eyes, at least.
I'm starting from a premise\nshared with Dipesh Chakrabarti
and a few others.
But what I\'ve called the\n"new climatic regime"
organized the whole of\npolitical affiliation.
Tell me what you expect\nfrom the climate,
and I will tell you where you\nstand on all other issues,
including the social one.
In Climate Leviathan,\na political theory
of our planetary future, two\nMarxist social scientists,
Mann and Wainwright, started\nfrom the same premises
as I, ending with four\ngeopolitical scenarios,
very much like my planets.
They have one vivid illustration\nof planetary conflict,
with this image showing\nNew York City in 2012
without electricity,\nin anticipation
of Hurricane Sandy.
I understand you have\na much better one here,
but I didn't know that.
We are just Marxist\nscholars after all.
We don't know anything.
With only the Goldman\nSachs tower brightly
lit thanks to its\nown generators,
the same geographical space\nthat is a cartographic grid
of Manhattan is occupied by\ntwo different climatic regimes,
one submitted to Hurricane\nSandy, the other indifferent
to it.
Banks remain fully operational\nwhen everything else
is coping with a Hurricane.
Like a rocket, it looks-- it's\nvery funny-- at Cape Kennedy.
Goldman Sachs is apparently\nready for liftoff.
The lesson is that on the\nsame cartographic space,
people belong to\ndifferent soils or are
grounded in a different land.
This is typical, I\nargue, of a Gaiapolitics.
The question of which\npeople belong to which land
is foregrounded again.
As I argued at length\nin Facing Gaia,
just as at the beginning of\nmodern political philosophy
at the time of Hobbes, we are\nno longer dealing with humans
in Nature, but with divided\npeople engaged in civil wars,
having to reinvent\nsocial order altogether.
Climate mutation means\nthat the question
of the land on which we\nstand is back into focus.
Everything happens as\nif Games of Thrones
has become a general\nmodel for considering
of the politics,\nexcept, of course
that the threat is Armageddon,\nand not winter, is coming.
In a long investigative\nessay in The New York Times
that confirmed part of\na chronology I proposed
in Down to Earth, Nathaniel Rich\nadds a third detailed analysis
of such a bifurcation.
Just when proof of a\nchange in climate condition
were accumulating as\nearly as during the Reagan
administration, Rich\nshows how efficient
has been the enterprise to\ndeny the coming Armageddon.
Where certainty about\nthe threat, as well
as the denial of the\nthreat have grown together,
some people have seen that the\nplanet will never be the same,
if scientists were right.
And they decided-- arguably\ndecided somewhat consciously--
that it was time to move\nto another one, where
all the dramatic changes\nanticipated by scientists
would not happen, or at\nleast, would not be visible,
or would not modify\nthe social order.
Strangely enough,\nactually, Nathaniel Rich
missed this point entirely\nin his own interpretation
of a document he\nbeautifully shows.
This is why I think we\nhave to link together three
40-year-long episodes--
deregulation, explosion of\ninequalities, and expansion
of climate denial,\nwhich is the subject
of this just-published\nDown to Earth.
Whatever you might think\nof my interpretation,
the crucial point is that\nthe climate question is not
one aspect of\npolitics among others,
but what defines political\norder from beginning to end,
forcing all of us to\nredefine the older
question of subsistence and\nattachment to places, as well
as social justice.
In recent years, if you want\nto summarize the argument,
we have shifted from\nquestions of ecology,
which is about Nature\noutside of social order,
to questions of existential\nsubsistence on threatened
territories.
Nature is no longer\noutside, but under our feet.
And it shakes the ground.
Hence, the general\npolitical disorientation,
especially for the\nleft, who did not
expect to have to talk\nagain of people and soil,
a question mostly\nabandoned to the Right.
I'm sure you will agree that\ntaking kids to a planetarium
is a compulsory moment\nof any education--
to give them some sense of where\nthey reside in the universe,
to introduce them to planets,\nstars, Milky Way, galaxy,
black holes, and other\nsuch esoteric entities.
Well, I wish tonight to take you\nfor a guided tour in my wholly
fictional-- sorry,\nwholly, not holy--
wholly fictional-- English is\ncomplicated for a Frenchman--
wholly fictional planetarium.
It's a fiction, yes.
Although one thing is sure--
whereas all planetary\ninfluences on our horoscopes
have been thrown into doubt\nfor quite some time, there's
no question that the\ngravitational pull
of another seven planets--
in my reckoning,\nwe are seven only--
have an immense influence\non the way you feel, behave,
and especially on the way\nyou may predict your destiny.
So let's take the tour\nas a fictional astrology,
verging on serious geopolitics.
And as Mohsen very\nkindly said, there
is no direct correlation\nbetween architecture and design
in my talk.
You would have to\ndo the job yourself
of seeing the connection,\nbut maybe there is one.
The principle that would\nlead me in such a reckoning
is the link between\nthe territory
necessary for subsistence, and\nthe territory that we recognize
legally, effectively\nas our own, and what
has the source of our\nfreedom and autonomy.
Territory here, not only in its\ngeographic or administrative
depiction, but also in what I\ncall Gaiagraphic definition--
that is, all of the other\nagents, no matter how remote,
that allow a good agent--
human or non-human-- to subsist.
These are what its\nterritory consists of.
So it's a reverse, not the\nterritory administrative,
but give me the\nsubsistence, and I will
know what the territory is.
And subsistence has been\ntaken in a very large sense.
I would start from\nthe assumption
that the present\ndisorientation is
due to a fabulous increase\nin the usual lack of fit
between the two\nsets of constraints.
We inhabit as citizen\na land that is not
the one we could subsist on.
Hence, the increasing feeling\nof homelessness, a feeling that
is transforming the\nformer ecological question
into a new set of more urgent\nand more tragic political
struggles.
People everywhere are again\nlooking for land, a situation
that I\'ve called for this reason\n"the new wicked universality."
The first planet I\nwill show shining
in my little\nfictional planetarium
is what could be\ncalled The Global--
that is, the sphere\nimagined by the attempts
at modernizing the Earth.
If I call it an\nimaginary sphere,
it's for the reason\nso forcefully
advanced by Peter Sloterdijk.
Although that property is\ndrawn from cartography, geology
and some geography,\nit's a sphere of ideas,
since it implies that\neveryone on Earth
could develop according\nto the American way
of life, and forever, and\nin the absence of any limit.
It's the globalization as a\npositive Utopian or dystopian
ideal, which has been\npursued, and still
has some attraction, until\nthe end of the 20th century.
And of course, there's\nanother side of the story
of this Global planet, and\nthat it's entirely colonized,
in the sense that none of\nthe nations composing its map
occupies the official\nspace inside its borders
and frontier.
China, Europe, the United\nStates all occupy territories--
sorry, all occupy the\nofficial space in--
sorry, all occupy other\nterritory in many ways,
either forcibly or\nthrough the partially
hidden means of phantom acreage,\nto use Kenneth Pomeranz'
powerful expression.
And you know many of his\nimages on types of maps.
This is what Pierre\nCharbonnet called
"the ubiquity of a\nmodem," to underline
that there is no\ncorrespondence at all to expect
between the shape of a\nnation-state in a legal sense
and the wealth its\ncitizens benefit from.
Belonging to a territory\non such a Global Planet
is a sure way of\nbeing misled and lost.
Your health or your\nmisery come from places
that are invisible on\nthe administrative map
of your own land.
And in addition to this\nimbalance in space,
there is, as Timothy\nMitchell has argued,
an imbalance in time, since\nthe future in the Global
is entirely colonized\nin advance, so
to speak, by\ndecisions made earlier
to develop infrastructure\nbut putting you forever
in dept. The dispute on\nwhat to do about getting rid
of our carbon economy\nis a good case in point,
since most investment decisions,\nas it has been showed recently,
have already been made.
So paradoxically, no matter\nif they are rich or poor,
inhabitants of this\nGlobal have no way
to influence their own future.
TINA, There Is No\nAlternative, is
a practical result,\nwhich is paradoxical,
of centuries of obsession with\nthe question of emancipation
and freedom.
So the Global is\nsimultaneously that
toward which the whole world\nwas supposed to progress,
and a totally Utopian\nskewed domain, where
time and space\nhave been colonized
to the point of\nrendering it inhabitable,
and of paralyzing any reaction\nto the threat everyone
clearly sees coming.
This is nicely emphasized\nin the well-known argument,
as you know, I'm sure,\nabout the five planets
necessary to develop further\nin a non-American fashion,
or in moving the\ndata of a calendar
earlier and earlier every year\nto celebrate Earth Overshoot
Day.
France, by the way,\novershoot in May 5.
And you would not\nbe surprised to know
that you do that in March 15.
So France has still a little--
a month-- less responsibility.
It is very small.
I've often noted\nthis contradiction.
Even though the\nmoderns are supposed
to be hard-nosed realists,\nand to possess a fully
materialistic\noutlook, their vision
of where they were\nsupposed to be inhabitants
remain entirely ideal all along.
In this imaginary\nglobal sphere, there
were no specified climate\nconditions, no earthly limits,
no idea of the complexity and\nheterogeneity of the soil,
no feel for what allows\nany lifeforms to live.
And I'm sure architects\nfeel the pull
of that planetary attraction.
The paradox is such\nthat this global--
that is, the horizon for\neverything universal,
they say--
is also a cramped space, with\nno people able to really say in
it, "This is where I belong.
And it is from here that\nI draw my subsistence,
and where I find the\nsources of my liberties."
You expect to meet free people,\nand they sit on their butt--
Paradise-- unable to react to\na small question of a climate
transformation.
For the last 40 years, this\nplanet has felt the increasing
gravitational pull, so\nto speak, of another one,
which has been named-- and\nI think it's a good word,
by Chakrabarty--
"The Planetary."
It's different from\nthe Global, precisely
because it began\nto re-materialize
all the elements that been left\naside a bit too fast by those
who had embarked on the\ngreat progressive movement
toward the Global.
All that was externalized\nin one planet
is internalized in this one.
The Planetary is the Global,\nbut where the Earth is
reacting to human enterprise--
no longer a frame, a\nstage, but a powerful actor
with its own agency and its\nown temp, and also at a scale--
and that's where the\nsurprise is coming from--
at a scale that is\ncomparable in size and weight
to that of the\nhuman technosphere.
And its presence\nis now captured--
this is very well-known\nexpressions--
Earth system, or Lovelock\nGaia, or Anthropocene,
or great acceleration,\ntipping point, Earth boundary.
There are many of them.
The whole vocabulary\nthat has transformed what
was to have been\ntheater stage that
could be changed\nby human ingenuity
into a player intervening\nas a third party
in every human activity.
The key point is that\nit's not Nature as such
whose immensity,\nindifference, aloofness,
importance, and other\ncompassing weight
had always been celebrated,\nbut an agent with its own force
and power that requests to\nbe integrated in some ways
into the political domain.
Facing Gaia is altogether\ndifferent than facing Nature.
How to define the Planetary,\nif I use my little reckoning
principle, detect the overlap\nof territory and subsistence?
On the face of it, it\nshould be a great solution
to the radical homelessness\nsuffered on the Planet Global.
The human, now as\nbig as the Earth,
is easily superimposed\nto a planetary system
of comparable size in such a way\nthat all question of freedom,
and governance, and\nrepresentation are also
a question of subsistence.
You depend on the whole\nplanet, while the whole planet
is reacting to your action.
And yet, there is\nno such overlap,
for reasons that\nChakrabarty has tried
to disentangle since his first\nfamous paper On Four Theses.
A good locus from\nwhich to see this
is to consider the\ngreat Anthropocene cry.
As soon as the\nterm "Anthropocene"
was used in geology,\nclimatology, biochemistry,
and stratigraphy by\nnatural scientists,
it was immediately criticized\nby social scientists
for its complete insensitivity\nto the complex history
of human society.
There was, indeed,\na re-materialization
of condition of\nself-subsistence,
and a welcome one, at that.
But everyone agreed that the\nAnthropos of the Anthropocene
was too much of an abstraction\nto provide a real superposition
of the legal and social\nquestions of freedom
and autonomy upon the earthly\ncondition of subsistence,
although it was better to\nlive in the Anthropocene
than suspended in\nmid-air, as in the Global,
with an Earth Overshoot Day\nsomewhere in March or May.
The point was about that\ngeologists and biochemists
were not offering\nany view of an Earth
that citizens and activists\ncould recognize as their home.
Although the principles of\nhomelessness were tackled--
there was now a material earth\nunder the feet of people--
those people had\nno abode where they
could express their conditions\nin terms compatible with role
of social justice.
Humans were mainly plugged in\nas a box in the model developed
by earth system science in the\nPotsdam Institute or the IBGP
or IPCC, a box just like the one\nfor soil, vegetation, or ocean
currents.
So in spite of Gaia's\npull, Planetary Planet--
my Planetary-- could be\nfelt as another attempt
at naturalizing social life,\nbut for social scientists,
at the end of the human world.
And that Planetary\nwas seen as really
the end of a human\ndomination can
be shown by looking at two\nother, darker bodies, which
are coming frighteningly\nclose to the planetary.
Planets, the gravitational\nfields of which
could engulf all the others, as\nin a replay of Lars Von Trier's
"Melancholia."
"Melancholia," as you\nknow, finished badly,
if you have not seen the film.
If you have not seen the\nfilm, I'm sorry to spoil it.
The first of two dark\nplanets to consider
is the one I call "Escape."
Considering that it becomes\nbarely thinkable to imagine
any harmony between\nthe resources
necessary for subsistence\nand the exercise of freedom,
some have concluded that the two\nmain assumptions of modernism
should be abandoned altogether.
Freedom is for the\nfew, not for the many.
Breaking from the\nlimits of Nature
is essential destiny\nof those few only.
Hence, the name "Escape."
Let's forget about\nthe universality
of a modern dream,\nstill entertained
by people on Planet Global.
And let's accelerate the break\naway from early conditions.
If we wanted a simile of\nsuch a liftoff in addition
to the picture of New\nYork's Goldman Sachs tower
I showed earlier, I think\nElon Musk's red Telsa
car sent in space would\nbe a good signpost.
Although it superficially\nresembles the modernist ideal
of expanding in\nscience ad infinitum,
it's much more sinister.
As Musk himself recognized\nwhen he said of his enterprise,
"It is silly, but it\'s fun."
To my ears, with what was\nsupposed to be a joke,
he broke any continuity with\nthe former ideals of progress
for all.
This is, indeed, another planet.
On Planet Escape, the\nplan is that it will soon
be possible to download our\nmortal bodies into mixtures
of robot DNA, clouds, AI--
lots of AI-- situated\nas far as possible
from the humble\nand limited Earth.
Technology, after all,\nit is transcendence.
It needs no Earth, except\nas a provisional platform
before new adventures begin.
On to Mars!
In case those accelerations\nevaporate as so much hype--
if, for instance,\nterraforming of Mars
takes more time\nthan anticipated--
it might be wise to buy a gated\ncommunity or underground bunker
somewhere, preferably, as this\narticle shows, in New Zealand--
a real material,\nwell-protected terroir
down on an old, already\nthere former Earth.
Wherever the gated\ncommunity ends up
being situated the great\ndifference between the Global
and Planet Escape is\nthat there is no longer
any project for the billions of\nhumans who are explicitly now--
explicitly now-- left\nbehind, or to use
this cruel but frank adjective,\nwho have become supernumerary.
It\'s an extraordinary\nword, "supernumerary."
Civilization, in the sense of\na project invented by liberals
at the time of the\nEnglish Revolution,
is now abandoned for good.
The simple question\nremains, where,
will all those\nsupernumerary masses go,
all those left behind?
There is no difficulty in\nfinding where they are heading.
It's in the news every morning,\nespecially after Election Day.
When it's not in\nBrazil, it's in Hungary.
When it's not in Hungary,\nit's in Germany, or England,
or France, or Italy,\nor Bavaria last Sunday.
You name it.
And of course, it\nhappens even here,
in this benighted\ncountry of yours,
that is made\nsimultaneously great again,
and if I'm allowed\nto say, much smaller.
Here, there is another planet.
Let\'s call it "Identity."
That is, actually,\nthe biggest planet
of all, the one that\nover-shadows, it seems,
all the others.
Where do the millions\nof people go?
In one direction and\none only-- wherever
they would like, so long as\nthey remain behind walls.
So they can retain at least one\nelement of a former civilizing
project--
protection and identity.
Although troubling for the\ninhabitants of the other world,
the migration is\nperfectly reasonable.
If prosperity and freedom are\ngone, and if it's impossible,
as scientists insist, to connect\nprosperity and Earth condition
together, then let's at\nleast have an identity,
a sense of belonging.
It doesn't solve a\nquestion of a superposition
between subsistence,\nterritory, and freedom.
Maybe not.
But the promises of the global\nhave been left aside anyway.
Modernization is stuck.
Inequalities are\ngrowing every day.
And to top it all,\nwe have been betrayed
by those, the\ninhabitants of escape,
who are flying toward\nMars without us--
Mars or New Zealand, that is.
They don't even pretend\nto work for our benefit.
Noah's Ark is for\nthem, not for us.
They abandoned us.
We abandon them.
The avant-garde has been\nleft to hang out by itself.
No one follows them anymore.
And you might feel this\nanti-gravitational pull here
in Cambridge.
The leaders don't lead any more.
We have all been\nreplaced by others.
planet Identity's attraction\nseems to be overwhelming.
Everybody dreams of being\ninside a new national or new
local bounded space,\neven though it
might mean abandoning\nany pretense
at maintaining the civilizing\nproject of the recent past.
On Planet Global,\nthere was, remember,
a fundamental disconnect\nbetween the legal border
and the real territory.
We had to come in,\nin order to subsist.
But the horizon remained\nglobal, and the ideal
was still that of coordination\nand shared sovereignty.
They were in an\nawkward position,
to be sure, but\nsort of cantilevered
on top of an abyss.
But we had, at least, the\nproject of coping with it.
And of course, the best\nexample of such intervention
is the hapless, but still\nadmirably fought of the Climate
Conferences, the famous COP,\nculminating in the Paris
Agreement in December 2015.
But on Planet Identity, as\nwell as on Planet Escape,
there is no need\nfor such a horizon,
as we know from the decision\nof the present administration
to withdraw from\nthe Paris Agreement.
Climate deniers consubstantive\nto this project.
Those who criticize\nmodernity are
going to regret it\nwhen considering
the ravages committed\nby that long withdrawal
inside the walls of identity.
While on Escape,\nit's technology that
is supposed to be the\nsaving hand of God.
On Identity, there is\nnot even that hope.
Actually, hope is no\nlonger a possibility.
You cannot even say there,\n"It\'s silly, but it\'s fun."
Above all other attitudes,\nit's rage and despair
that I value most,\nwhich makes sense,
since homelessness is pushed\nto its most extreme expression.
The desperate effort\nto possess an identity,
but without any\nrealist material ground
to settle on and\nprovide with soil.
Populists are people,\nyes, but without land.
If I leave off here\nthe guided tour
for my fictional\nplanetarium, chances
that you are going to\nwitness to the same roaring
scene as in\n"Melancholia--" planets
crashing into one another.
But fortunately--\ndon't despair--
there are three other planets,\nthe complex interferences
of which are making themselves\nfelt in addition to before.
Of course, just like good\nplanets do in our Solar System,
they all act on one another.
So every one of\nour issues today,
no matter if we wish\nto build something,
or design an institution,\nor make any plan,
settle any controversy,\nit's pushed and pulled,
divided and influenced by the\noverlapping, contradictory,
and still-unsettled fields\nof attraction of those seven
bodies--
four that I've described.
There's three that\nI'd like to turn to.
Right now, the\nprobability they will
coalesce to make one\ncommon world is nil--
and I would say fortunately,\nbecause the largest of all,
Identity, is probably the\ndarkest and least promising
one to unify the\npolitical situation.
So what are the others?
Planet World is\nstill influential.
By this label, I\nmean what has been
the project of valued\ncivilization, mainly Europe,
but toward China, India, to\nproject their own boundaries
on to those of the others.
The result of those\nmany and contradictory
globalizations deserve the name\n"world--" not terribly good--
because they are all meant\nto add to their own borders
those of their legal expression\nof freedom and autonomy,
a vastly greater expanse\nof people, lands, mores,
resources, and good, which is\nsimultaneously integrated--
of course, scientific\nknowledge is a good example--
and maintain outside\nas foreign an exterior.
For Europeans, at\nleast, it could
be called the Planet\nGalileo or Descartes
to mark more clearly a change\nin the very composition
of the material with which the\nbody of a planet is being made,
and the new position\nin relation to the Sun.
A type of worldling that\nwas not so detectable
before, what is\ncalled, in quotation
marks, the Age of Discovery or\nwith even more scare quotes,
the Scientific Revolution--
a fabulous expansion\nof the world,
but without any\nsimilar expansion
of the feeling of\nidentity, hence
the strange creation\nor otherness
which has been\nalways co-evolving
with the sentiment of modernity.
The predicament of those\nwho have never been modern,
this has transformed\nthe others into others.
You could object that this is,\nthen, exactly the same planet
as the Global, with\nits growing cantilever
or disconnect between the\nlegal and belief territory.
But this would be to\nconfuse the Earth before
and after the main\nevent, that is,
the introduction of carbon--
coals and colonies, to use\nPomeranz' expression again.
What is becoming clear and\nclear to the historian,
viewed from a Planetary's\npoint of view,
is that there's not much\ncontinuity between the first
and the second\nmodernizing project,
let's say between the 6th,\n7th, 6, 18, and then 19 and 20,
with coal and oil.
The asymmetries in power between\ndiscovering and discovered
people were important\nbefore, but surmountable
compared to those of\na second period where
any encounter ran the\nrisk of annihilation
for the discovered.
Inhabitants of a planet world\nwere pilfering other society,
yes.
But you could not portray\nthem in the new one,
as agent of a six extension.
To use Timothy\nMitchell's expression,
they could not render the\nlink to the Earth invisible.
On the contrary, they\nentrench more and more
the notion of development\nand civilization
within a newly material\nand complex world they're
delighted in figuring out.
Economics were\nstill not of dealing
with prudence and limits, not\nyet what could render invisible
the condition of subsistence\nand infinite profit, which
is Mitchell's argument, as\nyou know, in Carbon Democracy.
It's carbon that\nhas transformed what
was a strike of chance,\na lucky mood, basically,
into a destiny.
Without carbon,\nEurope's expansion
was an intrusion,\nyes, complicating
the ways of life of all\nsorts of other empires,
as post-colonial studies\nhave so elegantly shown.
But with carbon, it became,\nto use [inaudible] term,
an apocalypse of civilization.
Although world seems a\nslightly weakened, outdated,
backward version of a\nGlobal and of a Planetary,
the same cannot be said about\nwhat I've called in Down
to Earth "the Terrestrial."
The Terrestrial is at\nonce that toward which
it seems that all progressive\npolitical movements are
heading.
And yet-- this is funny--
what is terribly\ndifficult to define.
Mann and Wainwright, the guys I\nmentioned earlier, call it "X."
Lantern and I, in a\nrecent paper in "Science",
called it Gaia 2.0.
Anna Tsing called it "living\nin ruins of capitalism."
And Chakrabarty,\nafter all these years,
is still struggling\nto give it a name.
Paradoxically,\nthe main attractor
does not seem to\nbe so attractive.
And yet, using the same grid\nas for the other planets,
it seems to offer,\nfinally, some sort
of a solution to\nthe homelessness
detected as the source of\na general disorientation.
It overlays the strange shape\nof territory-- and remember,
territory is whatever life form,\nthe source for any lifeform
whatever, as far as\nwe know it, as it
is, that allows it to subsist.
Atop a territory, understood\nas what free agent
can decide on their own.
If Anna Tsing's book takes\non more and more importance,
it's because it's probably\nthe first to show,
in enough detail, how such\nsuperposition is possible,
even though "mushrooms\nat the end of a world"
fits none of the earlier\ncategories of nation-state,
sovereignty, capitalism,\nclass struggle,
but renew all of those terms.
Why would it be different,\nthen, from the Planetary
whose presence and influence has\nbeen growing since the 1960s?
Precisely because it\nmight offer a solution
to the great Anthropocene\ncry I mentioned earlier.
You cannot insert into politics\nany sort of natural entity
without transforming the\nsearch for freedom and autonomy
into the simple domination\nof necessity and heteronomy.
I know.
I've tried everything\nfor 40 years.
It never works, believe me.
So to tell humans\nthat they behave just
like a geological force, as the\nCommittee for the Anthropocene
does so regularly\nand beautifully--
and even though it's\ntechnically true--
the scales are\ncorrect, the influence
is indisputable, the\neffect devastating--
it's not something that\nany political agent
can hear, without ceasing to\nbe a human political agent.
In becoming geology,\nit's impossible.
Anthropocenic-- can we say\nthat, Anthropocenic human--
have become as immobile\nand as paralysed
eyes as statues of salt.
But where did we\nlearn that freedom was
reserved to human lifeforms?
Where did we learn\nthat freedom was
reserved to human lifeforms.
This is where the discovery\nof Lovelock and Margulis' Gaia
comes in.
And we wrote a series\nof papers with Linton.
I don't have time\nto get into it.
Gaia is not of system science.
It's a much more interesting\nand astute sort of being.
I've no room to develop,\nunfortunately, the idea fully,
but the key element we\nneed here is the knowledge
that all lifeforms\nhave in common
that they make up\ntheir own laws.
They make up their own laws.
They don't obey rules\nmade as [inaudible]..
The key discovery of\nLovelock and Margulis
is that lifeforms don't\nreside in space and time,
but that time and\nspace is the result
of their own entanglement.
So although reconciling\nthe realm of necessity
and that of freedom\nis a waste of time,
connecting free\nagent with free agent
opens up completely different\nstyles of association,
and allows the building\nof different societies.
Basically, the terrestrial is\nthe same body as the Planetary,
but wherever politicization of\nNature has finally taken over.
So it's a very important shift.
If I'm slightly confident\nin the gravitational pull
of the sixth planet--
slightly, very slightly--\nit's for a reason that is not
visible until you bring all of\nthem together in a spatial--
spatial is a word impossible to\nsay for a Frenchman-- spatial
like space, spatial\nconsideration,
just as fictional as\nthe rest, of course.
But after all, it\ndoes not function
what is needed at this moment\nto focus our attention.
It's a nice diagram, isn't it?
In this diagram, done by\nAlexandra [inaudible],,
you will notice\nthat the Terrestrial
is pulled toward the\ngravitational field
of a seventh planet\nI've not mentioned yet,
and that I\'m strongly tempted\nto call "Contemporary."
Why do I name it that way?
Why do I end up with it,\nalthough it's also clear
that it should have been\nthe first to consider?
Precisely because\nit has never been
allowed to be freed from\nthe retrospective judgment
of the five other planets.
Whenever it's treated\nfirst, it becomes primitive.
Wherever people talk\nabout modernity,
they immediately\nequate, by contrast,
a primeval site, that of\narchaic attachment to the soil,
to the ground, which\nis either ridiculed
as that out of which the\nwhole civilizing trajectory
as been extricating\nitself, so to speak,
or, what is even worse,\nit's celebrated as being
a mythical archaic\nprimordial autochthonous
Ur-Earth, freed from\nall the tragic sins
of civilized humans.
Remember Husserl with the\nEarth that doesn't move,
Heidegger with the lived Earth?
If there's one lesson to draw\nfrom the extraordinary rebirth
of anthropology in\nrecent times, it's
that, for probably the\nfirst time in anthropology
for 200 years--
probably because of\nthe symmetric pull
of the Terrestrial, actually--
the many societies of human\nand non-human that are active
on the Earth are allowed to\nstop having to define themselves
by comparison with modernity, or\nto be taken only as having rich
symbolic views of Nature,\nwhich what has been called,
probably misleadingly,\nthe "ontological turn,"
they are free at last to\nbe our contemporaries--
difficult to pronounce.
Maybe I should find\nanother name for it.
Contemporaries--\n"modern" looks better,
but contemporaries is better--
and maybe also to extend\nsome of the recipes we
might have for composing\nsocieties made of free agents.
As Viveiros de Castro is\nfond of saying, what is sure
is that both societies\nof human and non-human
are expert at survival.
And now, they are\ntheir own planet.
And they can fight back.
It's about time we move from\nmodernity to contemporaneity--
that is, to the present.
Let me now conclude\nthe tour guide
on my fictional planetarium\nwith three very short remarks.
The first is that\nthere is not, as you
see here, one, but three or\nfour different arcs of history.
And modernity,\nmodernity is really very
small, probably something--\nsee, it's a very short movement.
Already here, it becomes--
begins to turn.
And then "chook,"\nand then "chook."
And then here, the attraction\npull, and then here.
So there are many\ndifferent arcs.
So we are getting weight\nof modernity, which is--
I mean, for architect\nas well for philosopher,
it would be so good.
Modernism appears now as\na small parenthesis that
went from world to global,\nand which is now torn apart
by two radically different\ngravitational pulls,
one by what I've called the Dark\nPlanets, Escape and Identity--
even though they have\nthe majority, of course--
and the other by those\nwho are rematerializing
the Earth in different but\ncomplimentary fashion, namely
Planetary and Terrestrial.
Architects and\ndesigners, I'm sure,
may now understand\nthat to having
a project of designing\nfor the planet should
be added some qualification--
yes, but for which planet?
The second remark is that\nit's no wonder that we
feel politically disoriented.
Those seven planets make their\ninfluence felt at the same time
over every one of us, and modify\nthe path of our enterprise
minute by minute.
We are not divided in two--
forward or backward--\nbut at least in seven.
Every time we choose a course\nof action, utter an opinion,
we feel engaged or repulsed\nby the weight of those bodies.
Every act, no matter how\nsimple, has become contentious.
The third and final remark is\nthat if my geopolitics map is
even vaguely coherent,\nit should be clear
that there is a general movement\nnot to go back to the past.
Moving forward or backward was\na typically modernist conceit
during this short\nmoment here, segment.
But we move, I think--
I don't know how you\narchitects, you're
always very good at capturing\nthis sort of mood or style--
we move from more\noutside or more inside.
There is a sort of insiderness\nthat is making itself felt.
And that is visible in\nscience as well, I think,
as in the art, and what I\npursue in serving my project.
And this is a bit of\npublicity for what I'm
doing next week in New York.
Well that's the end.
Thank you much.
[applause]
So hopefully, we can\nhave some questions.
One thing, I think\nthere are some mics,
so maybe people can raise\ntheir hands, and we can--
one thing, Bruno, is\nthat in architecture
and in design schools, the word\n"contemporary" is very common.
And "contemporaneity"\nis very common.
OK, my fault.
Which is very\ninteresting, no, because I
think that their struggle is\nnot the struggle of overcoming
modernity, but it's\nreally the struggle
of addressing the questions\nof the contemporary
or the questions\nof contemporaneity
in a way that addresses\nthe question of spatial.
But the spatial in a way that is\nnot just about space, but it's
about the relationality\nof spatial
in a way that entangles\nthose who are also
engaged in it, so the user or\nthe participant or something
like this.
So that question\nof contemporaneity
with the spatial also\nexists at multiple scales,
because we are designing,\nlet's say a room or a house.
And we have to think\nabout the specificity
of that particular moment.
But we are also thinking\nabout the scalar condition
of the spatial, where the thing\nthat we're working on-- whether
it's a house, or a landscape,\nor a part of a city--
also exists as an exemplar\nof a bigger project.
Therefore, the thing is also\nindicative of a bigger project
of a responsibility, which is\nlarger than the specific thing
that we are working on.
So I think that question\nof the sort of the scalar
is also something interesting.
And one thing that I didn't say\nis that you, as is evident--
it's a pity that the\ndiagram has disappeared--
but you constantly work\nwith visual material.
You work with exhibitions.
And you've been\nusing exhibitions
in a way to also promote the\nkind of ideas that you have.
So one thing that\nwould be interesting
is really for us to\nalso now try to get to--
which is wonderful.
I mean, it was really great to\nhear this kind of description
of conditions, to\nthe moment when
one can also construct a certain\nset of conditions in response.
So that we are not escaping.
We are not moderns.
And therefore, somewhere\naround this space
of the Terrestrial\nto the Contemporary,
there is also a project.
There is something,\npresumably, that is made.
Right?
[laughs]
And how is that?
For us, it's not so funny.
We have to do this constantly.
So--
I guess your life\nis complicated,
because if you have\na project here, it's
pulled and pushed by all\nof these things in between.
Exactly.
But this is also part of\nthe project of design.
So design has to\nnegotiate with this.
So there was some relation\nwith what I said--
So I'm trying to.
Yeah, there is some\nrelation to design.
But I want to ask you about\nthe word "melancholy,"
because in the way that\nyou refer to the movie,
the word "melancholy" is a\ncondition of sadness purely.
And it's the bad end.
But also, melancholia\nhas been used
as a specially induced condition\nwhich can be very productive--
melancholia as a\nmode of reflection,
as a way of producing\na kind of project.
Do you feel that there is a\npossibility for melancholia
to also provide some kind\nof a space of projection,
or a space of sort\nof thinking, that
provides at least temporal--
not solution, but\ntemporal suggestions,
recommendations for\nthe Contemporary
to exist in different ways?
Or how would you--
how would you construct\nthe sort of project
beyond the Contemporary?
How to construct a\nproject, I don't know.
But there is this word by a\npsychiatrist from Australia
called solastalgia,\nwhich is close to--
but it's a specific condition\nthat this guy in Australia
found.
And Australia, as you\nknow, is destroyed
by ecological transformation,\nand doesn't pay any attention
to it, which is precisely\nthe feeling of hopelessness
at home, the feeling that\nthe Earth is actually
disappearing under your feet,\nand that you are paralyzed.
So just my very simple scheme--
I mean, homelessness is a\nvery old and very traditional
question of cultural ideas,\njust like melancholia.
But there's something\nspecific if my argument
that all politics is\nlinked to this question
of a new climatic\nregime is visible.
So that's what I say.
So all of this\nquestion about project,
about multiplicity of positions\nto take simultaneously into
account-- this is as old\nas building anything.
But what is new\nis this situation
that we now disagree,\neven on the common world
in which all of these\nprojects are taking place.
We disagree-- we don't\ndisagree inside space and time.
We disagree about\nspace and time.
And it's different\nif a Planetary, which
is all the sort of big ESS\nscience of system science
is also different\nfrom the terrestrial.
It's also different from that.
This is just a dispute\nwhich is simultaneously
inside the science, inside\nour own psychological makeup.
And that's where the\nsolastalgia can get in,
and which produces what I call\nwicked universality, which
is basically, we talk\nnow to people who
have lost their land in a way--
those that are losing the\nland and move, and those that
come inside.
This is very important for\nEuropeans, as you know,
because of the migration crisis.
And they talk to people inside\nFrance, Germany, Bavaria, et
cetera, who feel also that\nthe Earth is also moving.
And that's a new situation\nwhich is much more tense because
of a Planet Identity, which is\na general movement everywhere
simultaneously in the world,\nfrom Indonesia to Brazil,
which--
I mean, there's a\nmassive phenomenon here,
which is so important\nfor geopolitics
and political\nscience, which is all
of the leaders in all\nof these nation-states
have been eliminated.
Why?
I mean, what's happening?
I mean, the drag before--
no, the pull, the push or\npull, the drag, the pull,
the pull of a global horizon\nhad hidden all of this division.
But now that the pull\nis no longer there,
then no one leads anymore.
So I'm trying just\nto make sense of what
does the new climatic regime\ndo to sort of old questions,
basically, so\nincluding, of course,
melancholia and all of these\ntraditional questions of design
probably are influenced by it.
I mean, it's a very\nsimple argument.
It's not that simple.
Even if it looks a bit strange,\nit is a simple argument.
Don't you feel\nthis homelessness?
Of course, this homelessness\nis very general,
but a specific type\nof homelessness.
If you read, last\nweek, IPCC Report--
do something, 1.5 degree.
Two weeks before, it\nwas 15,000 scientists
saying it's soon too late.
One month before, it was 30%\nof the species are going--
of the insect species, have\ndisappeared, of birds, sorry,
and so on, and so forth.
What does all of this news do\nto the psychological makeup
of people?
This is what this\ndiagram is about.
My argument is that even if you\nare a denier or indifferent,
it eats your brain\nand your heart.
And it does something\nwhich explains, for me,
a brutalization of politics,\nbecause you cannot possibly
understand how you\ncan do anything,
nor can you relate to this\nnews, which non-philosopher
scientists are producing.
Denial and skepticism is\njust one version of it.
I mean, it's a simple\nversion, which is, in a way,
very understandable.
But it has something\nmore psychosocial in it.
And that's what I\ntried to capture,
even though it's\nnot my discipline.
I'm sure I'd like to give\na chance to other people.
Please, go ahead.
Thank you for once\nagain reminding us
of the continuing importance\nof semiotics in science,
both with regard to what\nscience operates upon
and what it produces in terms\nof contemporary culture.
I am astonished, though, that\nyour fictional representation,
your planetarium of\nthings contemporary,
should be connected\nto a climatic outcome
that you describe as a\n"climatic regime," as a thing.
Because the problem with climate\nmodels, as with all models,
is that they are not things.
They are not what?
They are not things.
They are metaphysical\nrepresentations
of what one hopes is reality.
As someone who publishes in\nclimate science journals,
I'm acutely aware of this,\nand acutely disturbed,
that one should elide the\npolitical project, which
has been ongoing for over a\ngeneration, since Earth Day,
with the actual state of\nthe art or the lack of it
in the models that\nto which we attribute
to the future\ncondition of the world.
Thank you.
Well, you are then on planet--
where are you, then, Escape?
No.
The planet where the climate--
I'm Planet Complexity.
Yes, OK, well--
OK.
But the whole argument\nis based on the idea
that there is something about\na new climatic regime which
does make--
you notice that I use\n"new climatic regime."
I don\'t use\n"Anthropocene" so much,
because precisely\nAnthropocene would lead us
into the stabilization of all\nthese models, which are always
models, as you say.
But new climatic\nregime is a word
which is much more closer\nfrom law and politics,
like "new regime--" that is\nfor Frenchmen, old regime,
new regime, it means something.
So this is why I\nuse this expression.
It does something to the way\nwe organize our politics.
And it was-- this is\nwhy Rich is interesting,
because it was seen immediately\nby the Reagan administration.
They immediately\nsaw the relevance,
even though 30 years ago, it\nwas not as certain as it is now.
And they immediately\nlinked into it.
The head of-- I forget\nthe name of the head of--
I don't know what Peter\nthinks of this article.
But it was an interesting thing.
Immediately, the core evolution\nof denial and certainty,
they grow together.
The more you are certain,\nthe more you deny.
That's an interesting\nphenomenon for science relation.
Can you talk a little bit\njust about the diagram,
and the necessity of separation\nversus the relationality
of the elements to each other?
Can you switch it off?
Because I don't want to have to\nanswer this question, because--
You don't?
OK, Peter, you ask the question.
No, but I think it's interesting\nthat within the worldly, which
is contemporary--
That's the problem with\ntalking with an architect
and a designer.
You have identity and\nescape simultaneously,
and you don't necessarily\nalways have them.
So the proximity--
No, no, we are always planet--
every one of us, we are\nalways Planet Simultaneously,
of course, I'm sorry to say.
No.
Well, sorry, he\ntook it seriously.
We want it back.
No, the only thing I would\nkeep from the diagrams
is the interesting curve.
Because what I'm trying to\ninterest you, architect, to be
inside the net.
You see, is it's not forward or\nbackward, or inside or outside.
I mean, what happened was\nwith the pull to be inside,
which is one very\ninteresting thing
I'm doing with\nscientists now, working
on what I call "critical zone."
I'm doing an exhibition\non that, actually.
And I'm interested in\ndeveloping, if any one of you
had an idea, a link with what\nyou would call "landscape"
and what those scientists\ncall "critical zone," which
is an interesting interface\nI'm trying to develop.
Anyway.
Bruno's looking for volunteers.
So there's somebody here.
So one of the things that\nstrikes me about the diagram
is that it's all\ncircles and spirals,
except for the terrestrial--
that there is a way in\nwhich something happens
at the open-ended question\nmark-headed arrow that
leads through the terrestrial.
And the terrestrial has\na kind of superposition
of a cross-section\nof the Earth, maybe,
and a Mondrian painting, a kind\nof "Broadway Boogie Woogie."
And then that put me\nin mind of thinking
of the planets, the planet\nof the sprawl, of the urban
in a transnational way, in which\nwe have all these connections
with airplanes and\ntrains between cities.
And the great\nopposition that we feel,
which is astonishing to\nme at this late date,
between the rural and\nthe urban, that we
feel so strongly in France,\nin Germany, in Brexit,
in Trump's election,\nI mean, constantly
this sense of the cities form\na kind of planet that exists--
Themselves, yeah.
--that is being rejected\nhugely outside of the cities,
and contested in the suburban\nregimes that surround them.
And I wondered, in\nthinking about this moment
of [inaudible] saying ruins of\nour own societies that you put
up late in the talk as you\ncame to the terrestrial,
and how you think about this\noverlay in the Gaia world
of the built environment in\nthere, sort of the world of a--
of a constructed world\ninside this very thin,
this razor-thin layer of Gaia.
It's an artifact,\nactually, of Alexandra.
Alexandra wrote a paper with me.
I mean, she\'s the first author\nin "Anthropocene Review"
on Gaiagraphy, which is this--
so she took it--
it's actually very clever, but\nof course, it's invisible here,
inversion of the\nnotion of a planet.
So she reused that.
I mean, it's completely\nopaque in this diagram.
I'm really sorry, so\nit ends up as a square.
But it's actually a very--
now I feel in what you said\nanother question, which is,
of course, those\nthree, actually,
are, of course, half\ncities, technospheres--
I mean, completely abandoning\nthe position between land and--
but with land, I was\ntalking about the soil.
I was mentioning the Earth.
We don't have the right word.
Of course, all of those\nare, I mean, concepts.
I mean, they are very\nimportant concepts.
It is very difficult, actually--\nthis is a whole part of it--
to represent something\nwhich is realistically
what is the subsistence\ncondition of the people today.
And that's the source\nof this orientation
in my little argument there.
And the disorientation\nis bigger every day,
when we learn about what the\nscientists are telling us.
Please, go ahead.
Hi.
Thank you.
The title of your talk\nreminds of a quote by one
of your peers--
"There is no world,\nonly islands,"
which seems to underscore--
There is no world, only what?
There is no world, only islands.
Only ions.
Ions?
Islands.
Islands.
Islands.
Islands, oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.
So there is no\nworld, only islands,
which seems to underscore\nthe impossibility
for a common ground, which\nis what characterizes
post-modern thinking.
In the wake of 2008, the crash--
Who is my peer here?
I didn't get--
Jacques Derrida.
Ah, OK.
Very honored to be a\npeer of Jacques Derrida.
In the wake of the\ncrisis, scholars
concerned with post-capitalism\nbeyond capitalism
identified the political problem\nof one no, but many yeses.
A new generation of scholars,\ndissatisfied with this aspect
of post-modern thinking--
Sorry, but is there a question?
Yes, so the question--
Could you just ask it\nas a question, though?
The question is--
Because he needs to follow.
Yes, the question is\nif you could elaborate
on the idea of universalism,\nwhich you briefly touched upon
during your lecture.
Well, one of the--
I mean I don't know if we\ncan go very far in this very
strange planetology.
But of course, one of\nthem is that everyone
has a different metrics.
This is what he alluded\nto in the beginning.
I mean, the metric is very,\nvery different in each of them.
And the other thing is,\nof course, the notion
of universality is different.
But the way I used the\nword "wicked universality"
is precisely inside\nthis argument,
that the sharing is not--
we have the same common world.
We will find the solution\nto climate change
and to all the other\nthings, because we have
the same set of principles.
And we have problems,\nthen we have a solution,
because it's a common one.
If this is universality,\nthen it's gone on the island
that you mentioned.
But there is a wicked\n[inaudible] back in,
so to speak.
And I'm doing an exhibit now\non that precise question,
which is, Tsing's argument.
We collaborate on\nthis new ground,
literally, which is\nyou lost your ground.
We lost our ground.
How do you do it?
How do we do it?
And that's where\nopening another--
I mean, "universality"\nis a very different term,
except we share the diplomatic--
I've tried to define the word\ndiplomacy in anthropology
around that.
It's a diplomatic\nencounter of people
who have lost their land,\nbecause many of these,
apart from the two last\nones, I mean, all of them
have lost their land.
It's complete asymmetry or\ncantilever between the two.
So it's an open space of\ndiscussion, and rituals,
and all sort of\nthings to be invented,
and for which there\nare, as you know,
many artists working\non that, which
is, how do we share\nthe condition of having
lost the land?
And trying not to be all\nin the Identity Planet?
This is really-- if we\nare not able to find ways
to talk to the people who\nare massively migrating
to identity, what we do,\nespecially in universities,
is just wasted, so to speak.
So this is why it's so important\nto really find a way to share.
You lost your mind\nand your land.
We do it, too.
OK, now how do we\nbuild from that?
Something-- actually,\nyou mentioned Derrida.
The whole reflection\nof Derrida on Algeria,
its past, et cetera,\ncould resonate with this,
if you are interested.
I don't know what\nDerrida would have
done with the new\nclimatic regime, actually.
It would be interesting.
We'll come to you.
One second.
Thank you very much.
I'm looking at the\norrery model, kind
of the series of spatial\nbodies that are agglomerated
in their relations.
And there's a few things\nthat I've been thinking of.
One is that some now seem\nto be qualified spatially,
and others are yet waiting\nfor a spatial reference,
although maybe that's\nembedded in the way you've
presented them.
So maybe the Escape\nbeing that space capsule,
or the thing that leaves the\nmain body ejected outside,
because I'm a bit--
I feel that the words "Global,"\n"Planetary" and "Terrestrial"
have a strong geographic\nor spatial imaginary,
and Escape, Identity,\nand Contemporary
are still waiting\nfor them to have
a kind of a clearer, and maybe\nspatial reference, a body
that we can imagine.
Is it an island?
Is it a satellite?
Is it a capsule, the thing\nthat leaves or the thing
that rotates?
But what I feel is that there is\nthat void that the blue marble
image has left for us, as that\nfixation of an image of that
which brings us, that synthetic\nimage, and the desire to fill
that void with some reference.
So you mentioned the Earth a\nfew times in that conversation,
and the title of\nyour recent book
is Down to Earth or [inaudible].
And it seems somehow that\nafter the Terrestrial,
the Earth leaves the picture,\nbut the Contemporary stays.
So one question is,\non these bodies,
where's the Earth if it is any\nof these spatial references?
The other is the incentive\nyou, the invitation you,
the underlying invitation\nthat there is a--
the shift to the terrestrial\nrequires the politicization
of Nature as one\nthat has taken over.
And I'm wondering\nwhat acts, what
are possible routes,\ninvitation, what is the arrow?
What is the?
What is the arrow?
What is the actual force?
What is the action\nthat can allow
us to move from one\nspatial body to a next one?
What could be possible actions\nthat allow that politicization
of Nature to take over?
How can we-- I mean, if\nthe image of the revolution
is not any more the\none, or the march,
or the writing, or the drawing,\nor the speaking, or-- you know,
you point to the void\nthat the intellectual has.
What are the actions that could\nallow us to shift the forces?
Hold that thought, and\nI get one more question,
and then you answer\nboth at the same time?
Do you think you can do that?
I'm in your hands.
I do whatever.
And especially [inaudible]\nis complicated,
so if I can get out of that\none, I will be a happy man.
This is two\nquestions, that's why.
Well, I hope I can help you.
I think my question does\noverlap a little with--
Then answer her.
--that complex one.
It would be great if\nyou could answer her.
But I - maybe this will\nbe an escape hatch--
I really loved your\nmapping, your descriptions.
All those worlds had that\ngreat satisfying click
of recognizability.
But except for Identity.
And I felt, because I\nlive on and off in France,
and I felt there was\nsomething really,
really French about\nyour sense of identity
as a kind of enclosed\nconsciousness of rage
and despair.
I have this argument\nall the time
when I'm in France with people.
In the United States, it\nis often a very, very--
the word has very different\nconnotations of community.
OK, just hold on.
Let me just finish.
So of community,\nwhich is something
which is agential, and\ncan often produce changes
that are beneficial.
We are all sitting here hoping\nthat certain communities are
going to at least prevent\nthe deepening hold of fascism
over our government.
Maybe we're crazy\nto, but I just wonder
if you have thought\nthrough your world Identity
in terms of how\nthat concept works
in places besides la Republic.
Now, I understand that.
And if you could help\nme understand it better.
Well, I'm a bit\nFrench, so [inaudible]..
But you're talking\nin universals.
And also because I think\nyou're perfectly right.
I should drop identity,\nactually, completely.
Because I tried\nprecisely to avoid
the word which would be\naccusatory in any sense,
like populism, and so on.
And identity-- you're right.
Well, it becomes\ncommunity, then we
talk about something\ncompletely different.
But I'm aware, now\nthat you say it,
that I projected some\nFrench things there,
and also because the tragedy in\nEurope, maybe, is more tense.
Well, actually, it's\ntense here, too.
But I think, madam,\nyou're perfectly right.
So I will drop Identity\nimmediately from revision.
But I need a better term.
So I mean--
Nationalism.
No, because neo-national, neo--
we want to keep\nthis word positive.
Because I mean, escape, I don't\ntry to be-- because I mean,
I can't be fair with these\nguys, but the acceleration
is of the one who simultaneously\ngo to Mars and to New Zealand.
I mean, it's--
I can't.
But identity, OK.
We'll discuss it.
So what about the Earth?
Well, the Earth\nis the term which
would have been unifying\nthe whole thing when
we had a common world,\nwhich we no longer have.
So that's the environment,\nwhich is, of course,
every one of these\nplanets or representations
had a view of the\nEarth as common.
But we are several,\nso it's gone.
It's gone.
It's gone.
It's up in the diplomatic space,\nbut it's gone in the sense
that if you begin--
I mean, this gentleman, the\nfirst question, obviously,
is on a word in which\nthe models of the climate
is not the big question.
So what it is to\nbe in a situation
where what is the\nmain conditions
of the temperature of\nthe modernist project
is not unifiable.
And you cannot play, again,\nthe goal of saying, well,
this is just archaic and\nobscurantist and anti-science,
because it's inside science.
The IPCC Report of two weeks\nago is inside the sciences.
And we are the\npeople who say, no.
So the whole link,\nalso, between the state,
scientific authority,\nleadership, vanguard,
all of that has\nbeen sort of broken.
So it's very difficult now to\nsay, well, the Earth is this
or the Earth is that.
And yet, every day\nin a newspaper,
scientific or\notherwise, you get news
that it's going to be too late.
It's going to be too late.
It's going to be too late.
It's going to be too late.
And we stay on our butt, with\nthis extraordinary decision.
But it's not a big deal.
I mean, it is solvable.
It's not an enormous thing.
But it is a decision not to act.
And this is something\nwhich breaks down
the unity of the-- of course,\nthe unity was, of course,
fictional, but\nthe apparent unity
of the current world,\nin which everybody
would have the same space.
And then we would find\nsolutions, basically problem
solving.
But you wrote a whole book\non this question, actually,
and which has a stylistic--
one would have this title.
We need not one book,\nbut we need seven.
It will be interesting to see,\nactually, stylistic difference.
And Alexandra is a\nbit working on that.
She's actually now in\nan architectural school
in Manchester,\nwith Albena Yaneva.
And she's doing a\nPhD on this question
of representation of Gaia.
So there's hope for architects.
As long as there's hope\nfor philosophy, I'm sure
there will be hope\nfor architecture, too.
Well, no philosopher would\n[inaudible] that philosophy.
But Bruno--
You have to be French\nto do [inaudible]..
By the way, one word\nthat's used in the context
of the university, in lieu\nof "identity" is "belonging."
Belonging, you need the soil.
I know, but belonging\nis not necessarily--
no, no, it's not only\nreferring to the soil.
Belonging also belonging\nto a community,
a group, which is part of,\nnot dissimilar to identity.
It's not belonging\nto that ground.
It's belonging in terms of--
You need the ground\nto have belonging, no?
Not necessarily.
Belonging is also in terms\nof affiliation, associations,
things like that.
But we can discuss it later on.
Anyway, thank you, Bruno.
Thank you all very\nmuch for coming.
[applause]
