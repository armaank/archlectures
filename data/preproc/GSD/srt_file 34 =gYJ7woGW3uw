Thanks for coming out.
I know it's a very busy time\nand a lot of mid-term reviews
and assignments and things.
So thanks for coming out.
We're here to celebrate the\nWheelwright Prize of 2015.
The Wheelwright Prize actually\nhas a very long tradition
at the GSD.
It was established\nin 1935 in the memory
of author Wheelwright, who was\na class at Harvard of 1887.
So this has quite a history.
And it was established\nas a traveling fellowship
and by now we've done a\nlot of research on it.
We've consulted\na lot of lawyers.
And the way that the\nWheelwright Prize
was written, the only\nthing we couldn't change--
well, two things we\ncouldn't change--
you have to travel, it has\nto be a traveling prize.
And you cannot ask\nfor any deliverables.
Now, we didn't tell that to Eric\nbefore but we actually cannot
ask for any deliverables.
And those were the two things.
And what it did--
it was started at\na time, conceived
at a time, when for\nAmericans foreign travel was
almost out of reach.
Financially but also just--
how do you get there?
And the prize-- its\nwhole intent was
to enable American architects\nto make the grand tour
like the European architects.
So at the Ecole de Beaux-Arts,\nyou couldn't really
be an architect until you had\ndone the grand tour of Rome
and Greece and then come\nback to France, for example.
So it enabled\nAmericans to do that.
And some of the Americans\njust to put the gravity to it:
Paul Rudolph, 1937,\nEliot Noyes, 1939,
William Worcester who was\neventually the dean at MIT,
1942, I.M. Pei, 1950.
So it-- as I said--\nhas a deep tradition.
In 2013 the Endowment had\ngrown to the point that we were
able-- or Mohsen\nthe dean was able--
to propose that we--
Sorry, from the beginning it\nwas only for GSD students.
Since its inception it\nwas only for GSD students.
But in 2013, Mohsen\ndecided he would open it up
to an international competition\nwith awards of $100,000.
And what we kept was\nthat you have to travel,
but also we made it\nthat it would support
travel-related research.
This was a time when the\nGSD was entering into--
or had entered into--
a real interest in\ndesign as research.
So travel-related research.
And the 2015 Prize winner\nwas Erik L'Heureux, who
will share his travels tonight.
Erik studied at Princeton.
And then after a short\ntime in New York,
actually migrated from\nNew York to Singapore,
where he started his\noffice called Pencil Office
and where he teaches\nat the National
University of Singapore.
Actually, he just got tenure.
He's associate professor\nat the National University.
We would like to think that\nwinning the Wheel Prize
helped a little bit--
that's going to be our claim.
But what won him the Wheel\nPrize on the other hand--
Wheelwright Prize--\nwas this thing
about design and research.
A lot of applicants\nwill have some
topic they would\nlike to research
and then they say, oh, and by\nthe way, here's my portfolio.
And they'll have nothing\nto do with each other.
And the ones that\nhave won, and the ones
that we think capture\nthe spirit of the prize--
and Eric's really did this.
Eric had done-- in his office,\nwhich has a kind of R&D
component even if a small one--
a lot of work on\nbuildings in the tropics.
And on building in the tropics.
And he already had\nwork from his office
that was a demonstration\nof that kind of research
and his proposal was basically\nto develop, continue, and
and intensify that search.
Mostly works on mid-scale\nbuildings that combine
challenges of density in\nSingapore-- you can imagine--
and urbanization.
But also the particularities of\nthe equatorial city, not least
of which is heat and humidity.
And his proposal was\ncalled Hot & Wet.
Each project is motivated by\narchitectural techniques-- not
supplements to architecture\nbut architectural techniques--
of ventilation, day\nlighting, thermal comfort.
And in tonight's lecture\nhe'll present his tour--
his grand tour-- which actually\nwas defined by the equator
and looking at cities\nalong the equator.
Five dense cities\nacross the equator
from the kind of megacities\nof Asia and South America,
to the smaller cities\nin India and America.
And we look forward to this.
Welcome, Erik.
[applause]
Thank you, Michael.
So I'm delighted to be here\nat Harvard on a somewhat
cold November evening.
And I hope I brought a\nlittle equatorial air
to warm the auditorium\nfor those of you still
longing for summer.
A very sincere thank you goes\nto the Graduate School of Design
at Harvard University\nfor funding the past two
years of travel and research\nthrough the Wheelwright Prize.
I want to give a special thanks\nto Dean Mohsen Mostafavi, K.
Michael Hayes, Preston Scott\nCohen, Jorge Silvetti, Cathy
Ho.
As well as the entire\n2015 jury panel
who had faith in my\naffectionately-termed grand
tour of the equator.
It's been an exciting,\nchallenging, and inspiring
research project that\nbegan-- as Michael said--
as an extension of\nmy design practice,
having moved from the temperate\nto the equatorial about 14
years ago.
I'm going to show a few examples\nof the outcomes of the travel
research--
I would say in a\nvery much beta state.
It's more of a sharing\nrather than a conclusion.
A sampling rather\nthan a composition.
So I'm going to begin Hot\n& Wet: The Equatorial City
and the Architectures\nof Atmosphere
as I did in the original 2015\npresentation, with a 1956 quote
from Maxwell Fry and Jane\nDrew: "The rapid increase
in population over the\narea of the tropics
presents itself to the world as\na problem of utmost gravity."
What was a pressing\nconcern over 60 years ago
in that quote has become\nan issue of critical--
if not dire-- importance today.
As a large portion of the\nworld's growing population
occurs in the tropical belt,\nthe resulting urbanization,
dramatic territorial\ntransformation,
and rising temperatures\nare altering
the equator in substantial\nand unforeseen ways.
When I conceived Hot & Wet,\nI looked to other architects
whose own grand tours seemed\ninstrumental in shaping
their design sensibilities.
Of course, Le Corbusier\ntraveled through Europe
between 1907 and 1911.
His outcomes being published\nas his Journey to the East.
Or Luke Hahn's own trajectory\ntaking a linear path
terminating in Karnak\nin southern Egypt.
As Michael said, the Wheelwright\nin its original incarnation
encouraged these\ntemperate-centric arcs
of travel--
enabling Paul Rudolph,\nI.M. Pei, and others
whose own parallel\ntrajectory largely
orbited around\nthe Mediterranean.
For me, I saw this as a\nkind of deeply indebted
temperate prejudice built\ninto the grand tour.
And by extension\nrooted in a latitude
of European and American\narchitectural discourse.
And being that I now\ncall the equator home,
I started to look to\nothers for guides.
The amazing travels of\nAlfred Russell Wallace
and his specimen collecting\nacross the Malay Archipelago
suggested another arc of travel\nlooking about the equator.
Not for architecture,\nin his case,
but for the natural world.
We could say eyes wide open.
Or Alexander Humboldt\nwith the equator
in his horizon in his\nfive year expedition
to the equatorial\nregions of South America.
The outcomes of his research\nas isothermal classifications
locate and make distinct the\nhot and wet areas of the world.
And define the area of\nwhere I practice today.
What's interesting in\nHumboldt's original conception
is that the area\nof the temperate
are relatively striated\nto a fine degree.
Understood maybe\nin great detail.
Yet, in contrast, we can see\nthe equatorial region remains
a large pink zone.
It's a crude understanding\nof the equator
as a single climate.
It's a temperate narcissism\neven for Humboldt--
a holdover from pejorative\nunderstandings from Aristotle
onward.
From the temperate\nvantage point,
the equatorial has always\nbeen negatively described.
Perimedes divided the\nearth into five zones--
two arctic, ones two temperate\nones, and a single burned zone.
To Pliny the Elder,\na Greek geographer,
describing the tropics\nas a ring of fire.
To Aristotle in his\ntext Meteoralogica--
claiming the tropics\nas a torrid zone--
asserting that the area was\njust too hot for inhabitation.
Or to Mark\n[? rebullious' ?] drawings
from the fifth century, where\nthe red fire-like center is
later reincarnated in Humboldt's\niteration now as pink.
Temperate ideas about climate\nand the resulting architecture
and urban configurations\nI would say
are largely\nself-referential, reinforcing
one's own climactic\nparticularities as ideal.
And if you think this history\nof temperate prejudice
is an old problem, we can\nfind built-in partialities
in contemporary writing\nabout the equator.
For example, in the 2016\nClimates: Architecture
in the Planetary Imaginary--
reviewing the climate\nof the equator
is a problem to be rectified.
In Eva Horn's\ninteresting essay--
Air Conditioning:\nTaming the Climate
as a Dream of Civilisation--
she begins, and I\nquote, "I had no idea
the tropics were that hot.
When I first exited the sliding\nglass doors at Changi Airport
Singapore--" that\'s\nwhere I live,
by the way "--I stepped into\nsomething I had never quite
experienced before.
This was not air as I knew it.
It was more like a\nsemi-liquid medium--
a gel, moist, hot, suffocating.
Something you inhale but that\nenvelops your body like a mass.
Impatiently dragging my\nluggage through that mass
toward the taxi,\nI started panting.
My head, my hands,\nswollen from heat.
The driver opened the\ndoor and I tumbled
in to the refrigerated\ninside of the car.
For a moment I felt relief as\nmy body escaped the suffocating
atmosphere."
Living in the suffocating\nhot and wet as I do,
I've tried to look at\natmosphere not as a problem
to be rectified, or tempered, or\nturned into a northern climate
through techno science\nor air conditioning,
but rather as a\nkind of potential.
To use another lens that\nconsiders atmosphere--
the hot air, the thick, the\ngel, the moist, the wet,
the semi-liquid, the\nmoldy, the stained--
all as mediums to work\nwith just as architects
normatively work with\nspace, material, and light.
The torrid has also been\ntraditionally understood
by tempered eyes as a place\nof pestilence and fear.
Or a territory of abundance\nand exuberant resources
ready for extraction.
Think colonialism or\neven tropical tourism.
Could we refigure a way\nto conceive architecture
and the equatorial city--
maybe in a more\nrobust and mature way?
My lens for my travels\nfocused on a moment
when modernism confronted the\ntropical right before the onset
of air conditioning.
When the friction of the equator\nrubbed into architecture.
When cities were\nusing urban artifacts
as symbols of independence for\nthe crafting of new societies
and new nations.
This moment-- we could say\nfrom the late 1930s to the end
of the 1970s--
is a tremendously rich\nand complex. period.
A golden moment of sorts.
And clearly the ghosts of\nMaxwell Fry, Jane Drew,
Otto Koenigsberger,\namong many others
are present in the research.
My travel looks upon this\nmoment not as a historian
but as an architect\npeering into the near past
to project a future--
for maybe selfishly\nmy design practice--
looking at artifacts\nas vessels that
embed the contestation\nbetween city, space, material,
atmosphere, maybe even politics\nand capital wrapped together.
My torrid tour took me\nnot only to five cities,
but eventually to eight\nacross the equator.
Four in Southeast Asia, one\nin India, one in Africa,
and two in South America.
I traveled close to\n100,000 kilometers,
sweating probably\nthe entire time
and enjoying it all the way.
My travel began as a\nseries of small arcs
from Singapore\nemanating outward.
Each one gaining in\ndistance following
the winds of the Northeast\nMonsoon east to west,
returning to Singapore\nafter each tour.
Semarang to Jakarta\nand Yogyakarta
and Bandung in between.
To Palembang and to KL and\nthen Pondicherry, Accra,
and then Sao Paulo and Joao.
I traveled back multiple\ntimes to cities maybe
nearer than far.
I would also say the\nhot and wet implies
a climactic specificity.
Typically with temperatures\nabove 80 degrees Fahrenheit,
usually in the mid\n90s in the afternoon.
With humidity exceeding 80%,\nan annual rainfall of a meter
or more per year, with some\ncities exceeding 2.5 meters--
that's eight feet-- of rain.
Numerical quantification\ngives only a partial sense
of this atmosphere for it\nreally needs to be felt,
walked through,\ninhaled, experienced.
Not simply understood as data.
So I was interested not in\na strict maybe climactic
geography--
Sao Paulo was really\nkind of an outlier--
but a range of\nhot and wet climes
that contained a spectrum of\narchitectural ideas suited
to their specific urban and\natmospheric environments.
I also want to say this\nisn't a solo project.
Numerous individuals\nimpacted the research.
From colleagues and\nfriends met along the way,
to architects and\nstudents assisting
directly and indirectly.
Allowing me to navigate,\ngain access or simply
converse about ideas that I've\nhad over the past two years.
I produced a--\nmaybe we could say--
ridiculous amount of data,\ndocumentation, photographs,
and footage.
All of which I'm still\ndigesting, editing,
and curating.
Hence the kind of beta\nstate of this lecture.
So I'm going to begin with a\nlittle preview of my travels.
[rain]
[thunder]
[faint singing]
[thunder]
[city sounds]
OK, I will begin now.
My travels commenced in the\neastern city of Semarang
in Indonesia.
A relatively small\nsoutheast Asian locale
of 1.7 million people.
Seven degrees south of the\nequator on the southern edge
of the Java Sea.
Semarang is really two cities.
A northern flat\ncity, a coastal city
with it's southern\ncity as a tail--
that you can see here--
is one of topography class\nand contrasting status.
The flat city runs out as a\nblanket of roofs, streets,
and courtyards.
A desakota in visible\nterms, were landscape, roof,
and object blend together in\na continuous field of urbanism
and vegetation, motorbike and\nshop, house and school, Mosque
and factory.
The topographic city\nfolds in on itself--
filling valley and\nhill alike, making
visible the class differences\nby elevation and section
rather than by\nplanned proximity.
Large volumes dominate\nthe volcanic hills
as they look to the growing city\nthrough the heavy atmosphere
of the afternoon sun.
Semarang is also a city\nof trade and markets.
Its access to the\nhinterlands of central Java
link it to the trade\nroutes of Asia.
Historically, this\nhas been reflected
in the large Chinese diaspora\nand its own Chinatown.
As is its demographic\nmix combining Malay,
Javanese, Arabic, and\nIndian ethnicities
throughout the city's fabric.
Here we can see the\nedges of Chinatown
in a series of middle class\nparty wall shop houses--
located just adjacent\nto the Dutch Kota
which was an important\nVOC and colonial trading
port during colonialism.
Jewelry and gold markets\nare adjacent to food
and dry good markets.
And here in this original\ndistrict now in decline,
the city moves further\nand further inland--
retreating from the\nfloods of a rising sea.
The buildings here have\nbeen largely abandoned
except for the perimeter\nshops on the ground floor
and a lively street\nlevel daytime trading.
The developmental\npressures of Semarang
are great as this city continues\nto grow outward and upward.
The density of the shop\nhouses are being transformed
into the rise of mid-scale\ntowers that have begun to make
their mark in the distance--
transforming the\ncontinuous large roof
into the city of elevations.
As an extension of\nthis trading fabric--
and central to\nSemarang's identity
as the role of the market--
a typological big roof that\naggregates and condenses
the diversity of\nsmaller traders,
shopkeepers, and merchants\nunder a single and identifiable
surface.
In Semarang there are\nover 20 large markets,
each one serving a neighborhood\nat the district scale.
The largest and most dramatic\nbig roof is the Pasar Johar,
built in 1932 by the\nDutch-Indonesian,
Herman Thomas Karsten--
an engineer and\nplanner by profession.
At the time of its\nopening, the Pasar Johar
was claimed to be the\nlargest covered market in all
of Southeast Asia.
And like all good\ntorrid grand tours--
a little drama\nbegins my research.
After receiving Michael's\ncall sometime in April,
I think it was, of 2015--
and before I could even get\non a plane to Semarang--
this vessel of study\nsuffered a horrible fire.
Fire ripped through the\narchitecture in May 9, 2015,
rendering the market to ashes.
It was a great way to\nbegin my research--
all going up in smoke.
But I was determined\nto go, and when
I arrived the market was still\nsmoldering with ash, soot,
and the remains of\nlivestock and livelihoods
strewn about the floor.
The fire caused over 4,000\ntraders to lose their venues,
with many more\ninformal kiosks being
erased in the fire's wake.
Because of this\nprogrammatic erasure,
the architecture was rendered\nas foreground rather than
background, and its role as a\ndramatic atmospheric framework
became even more self-evident.
The market is composed\nof three sections
oriented on a north-south axis.
Rectangular in plan\nwith a slight chamfer
for the open air market at the\nmost southern of the squares.
While the market scale is vast\ncompared to the small scale
aggregation of the Chinatown\nfabric just adjacent.
In the large open courtyard--\nhaving just burned--
contained a series\nof steel structures
of pitched and flat roofs\nwith small dry good merchants
beneath.
You can see Raman here--
digging through the remains of\nthe market on the lower right,
his stall having been\nincinerated just weeks before.
The central square extends\nthe roof across the square,
covering it with four\nlarge concrete planes
all in equal size.
The market that had just been\nbefore under the concrete roof
quickly re-established itself\nexactly around the perimeter
of Pasar Johar, encasing the\nembers in a ring of trading.
The burned market\nis to the left--
which is here-- and the\nnewly established market
was established under a series\nof orange and blue tarpaulins.
We could say a\nsymbol of resilience
if there ever was one.
The displaced merchants rebuilt\ntheir networks as quickly
as the market burned.
For their livelihood\nis intricately
linked to the central\ntrading area of Semarang.
Back under the burned canopy,\ntraces of each merchant store
littered the plan--
ceramic, pottery, and\ndishware are all visible
as though it was an\narchaeological site.
Flanking ramps on the\nnorth and south elevations
allowed goods to move easily--
vertically-- for Karsten had a\ndeeply embedded social agenda
in the architecture.
The market was, as\nI understand it,
designed for the small-scale\nlocal and largely female
merchant class even from\nits incarnation in 1932.
A series of cast-raised\nplinths allowed merchants
to place their goods off\nfrom the contaminated floor.
The large two story columns\nmarch across the double volume
from veranda to volume alike.
The central square was\nonce the wet market--
where we can imagine smells of\nraw meat, fish, and vegetables
percolating through the space\nrequiring the most ventilation.
Each wing contains 24 columns\nrising above the floor
about 8 and 1/2 meters.
The volume of contained\nair is grand in proportion.
A large swimming pool of thick\nJavanese air and moisture
slowly moving from\nstreet inward and upward.
One cannot help but make\nparallels between the Johnson
Wax headquarters designed by\nFrank Lloyd Wright from 1939.
Only that Karsten's\nPasar Johar was completed
some seven years earlier.
The similarities are\nshockingly close--
interior veranda,\ndouble height space,
and marching capitals alike.
We could also trace the\nwork to Robert Maillart's
first mushroom slab structure\nin the warehouse Giesshubel
in Zurich from 1910.
Or his grain storage of the\nSwiss Confederation in Altdorf
from 1912.
Karsten clearly appears to have\nadopted Maillart's techniques--
articulating column to\ncapital in a smooth arc,
while capital to slab\ninterfaces contain a series
of stepped transition planes.
Karsten also removed\nthe continuous perimeter
to allow for a full ventilation\nof the interior space
laterally.
Inside the light oscillates\nbetween the intensity
and the bleaching quality\nof the equatorial sun,
and the dark undersides\nof the lower market.
Sound of the nearby\nmosque, roaring motorbikes,
and street-side merchants--
rooster caws\nincluded-- percolate
through this roof assemblage.
Traces of the\nrattan formwork are
imprinted into the\nunderside surface
of the concrete between\nthe oculi, which illuminate
and ventilate simultaneously.
So you can see the rattan was\npart of the original formwork.
The big roof is layered--
stacked upon stack\nslipping over one another--
bunker-like as a\nseries of layers
evacuating hot air and smell.
Side vents suck in air, light,\nand sound penetrating deep
into the underside\nof the market.
This architecture works with\npressure in a figural sense
to squeeze and open, push and\npull, shade and illuminate
in a calibration of air itself.
For the Pasar Johar, air\nand all of its contaminants
are as mediums and fundamental\ncomponents of the architecture.
I've worked with other\ndevices of capture
from thermal imaging--
where traces of the\ncolumns shown in green
are contrasted to a\nsurprisingly cool roof--
and developed a\nlanguage of drawing
to document the equator's\nspatial and climactic impacts
on architecture.
Especially at the detail.
For much of equatorial\narchitecture,
the deployment of\nthe overhang and roof
conceals the\nelevational complexity.
And can only be\nunderstood by looking up
through the worm's eye\nas a primary device
of understanding.
Karsten used the layering of\nplanes of concrete horizontals
to make up the roof.
But it is also the\nthick massive assembly
of air captured by the perimeter\nveranda and oculi that layer up
to construct the architecture.
The volume of air between\nthe roof and ground--
I'm thinking of a large maybe\npillow here being compressed--
under pressure that\npushes air out.
It's an exhalation.
An architecture that\ngasps and breathes.
The Pasar Johar is the\nmost dramatic and formal
of the Karsten markets.
I visited four of\nthem in my travels.
Even in its derelict state,\nit creates a very real sense
of inhalation and exhaust.
As though the building\nmoves air in and out,
pumping through a gigantic\narchitectural lung.
It's also a lung for the city.
A center of positive\nfriction and a pole
of gravity for trading and\nbusiness and livelihood
that anchors the city.
Of course, this\nisn't just a story
about atmosphere\nwithin the market,
but also about power\nstruggle for the market.
The frictions at the city\ncenter and the political agency
of the merchant class\nas older artifacts
confront developmental\npressures.
Throughout my\ntravels to Semarang,
rumors persisted that\nthe fire in May of 2015
was started by the\nusual suspects--
developers, the city\nofficials, whomever.
But it was clear that\nmost laypersons believe
power was at play to evict.
As a means to clear\nout land and open up
prime area of the city\nfor future development.
Even if the official explanation\nwas an electrical short.
It took a second\nfire also started
by dubious circumstances\nin February of 2016,
almost a year later--
and here I'm standing\nin this photograph
where that second\nfire occurred--
to displace the ring of\nstreet-side merchants
shown in those previous images.
The relocated market-- designed\nas a sponge to absorb this
dislocation--
is positioned at\nthe edge of the city
some three and 1/2\nkilometers away.
Though it was almost\nentirely rejected
by the Pasar Johar merchants--
the obvious isolation,\nits shoppers
dislocated, its supply\nchains rerouted,
its agricultural\nperimeter that doesn't
align with trading, selling,\nand buying for merchants
whose livelihood depended on\nthe market's central proximity.
The story doesn't look\nlike it's ending well--
a displaced merchant class,\na miserable relocaci--.
Though civic society\nhas rallied to preserve
in some form the\noriginal Karsten vesse,
a recent trip now\nshows a perimeter
of hoarding plastered with\nphotos of the market's earlier
and largely colonial days.
It's an interesting comment on\nthe nostalgia for the market
as Indonesia reinterprets\nand reincorporates
her historical legacies.
Even if they were part colonial.
Official word has it that the\nmarket will be resurrected
by 2020, though\nthat's a long time
for these small-scale\nmerchants to wait.
And rumors persist that\nit is really a land grab.
For the plans of the\nrehabilitated market
and its intended use are\nvery hard to come by.
My interest in Karsten\ncontinued to grow as I traveled.
And I visited the Pasar\nRandusari and the Pasar
Jatingaleh and the Pasar\nCinde, all of which
deployed the big roof as a means\nto aggregate the small scale
merchant class.
Karsten's worked as a\nplanner and architectist
throughout Indonesia.
And I traced his influence like\na detective to the Pasar Cinde,
in the city of Palembang on\nthe grand island of Sumatra.
My interest was to see the large\ntwo-story market in operation--
to view the convergence of the\narchitectural, the atmosphere,
and the inhabitational that\nI was denied in Semarang.
As I caught onto the winds that\ntraced westward to Pasar Cinde,
it to--
as I was soon to find out--\nwas to suffer a similar fate.
Palembang, a growing city of 1.5\nmillion, is a city of export.
A city of moving hinterland\nresources to river
to ocean ship.
It's a [? map ?] urbanism of\nroofs with tremendous traffic
and an upward middle class\nmade visible by its automobile
ownership and the\nunder-construction elevated
metro train system above.
The Pasar Cinde, dwarfed by\nthe coming infrastructure
is a vessel for the contestation\nof population growth,
developmentalism, and the\nlegacies of modernism.
This is the Pasar Cinde\non the bottom here.
I arrived just in time in 2016\nto find a reductive Karsten--
understood to be an\nadapted design by
Abu [? cousonno ?]\n[inaudible],, the head
of Public Works Departments\nof Independent Indonesia.
Skylights as simple\nrectangles, fluted columns,
perimeter verandas, all speak\nwith a Pasar Johar sensibility.
The market was full\nof smell and sound,
lively in the trade of the day.
The tropes of Karsten are\nthroughout-- column capitals
that merge slab to\nvertical in an almost
stalactite configuration.
The business was brisk, the\narchitecture crude, layered,
simple, and direct.
Basements had little\nof the ventilation
of Pasar Johar or the\nnatural illumination,
though the scale and size\nof the columns were robust.
A burly physicality to\nthe transfer of load.
The clear story layering\naccommodated ventilation
about the veranda,\nyet the market
foreshadowed the\ncoming realities
of developmental forces.
Just two months ago\nthe market is now
not only abandoned, but in the\nprocess of being destroyed.
It is as though the\nfate of Pasar Johar
has percolated\nwestward to Palembang,
as another city transforms from\nthe horizontal to the vertical.
Where the logics of walkable\nstories, small-scale merchants,
and the big roof are replaced\nby boxes, sealed envelopes,
and large-scale capital\nseeking rental income
on a return on investment.
The ruining of Pasar Cinde\nhappened without fire.
Believed to be due to its\nsmaller internal population
and thus diminutive\npolitical force.
But it's ruined no less--
an eviction in spatial\neconomic in historical terms.
In Palembang-- like Semarang--
the market was seen as a pole\nof social, cultural, economic,
and architectural value.
With protests outside\nthe Mayor's office,
posters of resistance, and\narticles in the newspaper
all illustrating a\nrobust, we could say,
civil society engaged\nin the politics
of architecture, modernism,\nand the city's future.
Just weeks ago, I\nwas provided photos
from on-the-ground activists.
The market subjected to\na complete demolition.
Only the capitals seem\nto remain as a resistance
to full erasure.
The proposed replacement\nin a token historicism
applies a ring of\nKarsten columns
to the Aldiron Plaza\nCinde's entryway--
which you can see here.
An applique that raises the\nquestions of preservation,
history, developmental\npressure, and the shift
from the horizontal and\nnaturally ventilated
to the massive and\nartificially conditioned.
Jakarta, in many\nways, is further
along this transformational\npath from the horizontal
to the vertical.
And the ventilated\nto the conditioned.
The city defies\neasy categorization
being the largest in Indonesia--
the capital of the nation.
It is the center of\npolitical and financial power
for the vast archipelago.
Jakarta's larger region\nis a rolling environment--
a village, dense city,\nland form, and agriculture.
The origin of Terry McGee's\ntext as the original Desakota--
that traces in plan from\nJava's northern coastline
along a series of 14\nrivers percolating
southward to the volcanoes of\nMount Sorak and Mount Gede.
The city has grown in bands\nof expansion southward
and its current\nform is a collision
of informal settlements,\nkampungs, urban villages,
middle class aggregations,\nhighways, commercial towers,
and super-scaled\nshopping complexes
all in close proximity.
Here growth occurs in\nsprouts and volcanoes,
erupting side-by-side\nto small singular homes.
The kampungs largely penetrated\nby motorbike, bicycle, or foot
produce the consistent ground\nof Jakarta punctuated by larger
figures of modernisation--
national monuments,\ntransportation,
infrastructure, and\nobject buildings.
For the vast majority\nof the residential--
architecture opens to\npedestrian streets of one
to two meters in width.
Front terraces merge\nwith passageways.
Inhabitants bound\nfrom another interior
to another across\nthe ground plane
of political and\nspatial porosity.
And when it floods--
a liquid porosity,\nall the more dramatic.
This foamy-like\nspace coats Jakarta
as a field of inhabitation.
The contemporary city which\nemerges from this foam
is not a model of integration\nin interpenetrability
but of large scale bubbles.
Towers and blocks of\nmassive proportion
contain a plethora of uses\nin inhabitational practices.
They are self-contained\nclimates unto themselves,
accessible by air\nconditioned automobiles.
Searched and sanctified by\nsecurity guards and gates,
perimeter private roads, and\nlarge-scale parking decks,
only after traversing\nJakarta's infamous traffic
where even president Jokowi\nwalks in the sun for two hours
to reach his meetings.
Just happened a few months ago.
The scale of such\nbubbles can be massive.
For example, in the grand\nIndonesia shopping town
that spans almost 7 million\nsquare feet a single building.
It's about a million more than\nthe United States Pentagon.
The adjacent kampung of\nthe streets of Mata Pura
just to the south rise only\na story or two or three.
Crossing from one spatial\nexperience to another
is a radical transformation\nof scale, density, porosity,
and organization.
My interest in Jakarta was\nnot in this shocking spectrum,
nor in the informal settlement\nto occupy the horizontal.
But rather in the mid-rise\nbuilding known as the Sequis
Center located south\nof Jalan Sudirman.
It was completed in 1978,\ndesigned by the architect
Hassan Roland Vogel--
supposedly of Swiss origin.
Located in the bottom\nright of this photograph,
the diminutive 12-story\nmiddle scale block
sits on a northwest orientation\nover the large boulevard.
To the left, the large civic\npark and national stadiums
of independence--
built for the 4th Asian games\nfrom 1962 under [? serkarno ?]
and financed by\nthe Soviet Union--
dot the landscape.
The Sequis Center has been\ndwarfed by its larger neighbors
as capital has\naggregated in the area,
and towers have grown\nlarger and more massive.
The building's\ndistinctive feature
is a perimeter envelope of\nparabolic fiber-reinforced
concrete, whose deep\nspatial envelope serves
as a thermal buffer\nseparating heat
gained from the building proper.
The fiber panels\nprotrude outward,
also shedding the interior\nfrom the ubiquitous monsoon
downpour.
The mass barely protrudes from\nthe large-scale vegetation
along Jalan Sudirman, yet\nsuggests an alternative vision
of architecture\nfrom its neighbors--
a hairy, opaque\naesthetic that works
with atmosphere expressively.
From above the building\nreads as a solid mass,
an assemblage of the\npointed and pitched roof.
A common trope of Indonesian\nvernacular architecture
that in this case had been\nminiaturized, multiplied,
and arrayed across the\nbuilding in elevation.
From below the\nbuilding's porosity
is revealed a window wall\nglazed without coatings
or reflective films,\nas the role of shading
is done through solidity itself.
The building and elevation reads\nas a series of subtle slits--
a strong equatorial aesthetic\nof opacity and materiality--
across the vertical plane\nthat is a resistance
to the temperate\nand the transparent
immediately adjacent.
The dramatics of the equatorial\nsun play across the envelope.
Looking out through\nthe eye-like profiles,
the view peers down to\nthe vegetated ground.
By doing so the windows shed\nthe normative requirements
of expensive embedded\ntechnologies,
shifting the role of\ntechnoscience and performance
to a simple material with\nexpressive architectural
agency.
The building stands as a vessel.
An urban artifact\nsymbolizing-- and maybe
even monumentalizing--\nan alternative vision
for the equatorial city.
Dark rather than light.
Deep rather than thick.
Perforated rather than closed.
Material rather\nthan transparent.
But growing in the background--
the new Sequis Center\nTower by the same developer
speaks of another\nmore common narrative
in the equatorial city.
The new building designed by\nKPF is a glass-enclosed block
with all the trappings\nof global fluidity.
A symbol that context\nis universal rather than
local in a city of\nproliferating bubbles admiring
New York, London, or Singapore.
Such manifestations\nindicate an entire mindset
of the eradication of the\nequatorial and architecture
decapitated from its\nown atmospheric context.
A neo-internationalism\nof displaced aspiration.
This narrative has continued\nnorthward across the equator
to Kuala Lumpur--
a parallel city to Jakarta--
where we find more of these\ntraces of global networks
and ambitions.
KL is a city of mini cities--
a city of clusters--\nsituated between the resource
extractions of an earlier\ntime in tin mining
and rubber production\nalong this Selangor River.
The city today oscillates in\nfolds across this topography--
known as the Klang River--
as a collage of shoots\nwith tremendous density
contrasting with compact\nlow-rise buildings and jungle.
The high-density aggregations\nhave led to a series of podium
blocks-- towers and volumes--
set in extreme\ntight juxtaposition.
Clad in symbols\nof contemporaneity
with an equatorial amnesia\nvia the curtain wall
as a system of enclosure.
The ubiquitous of the\ntemperate corporate towers
throughout KL--
as many Southeast Asian cities--
as they race to assert\ntheir symbols of wealth
even in the most background-like\nin uninspired buildings.
Indeed the\nspectacularity of glass
symbolizes not only an\naspiration of New York
or Chicago, but a potent\nsignification that we too
have a robust infrastructure\nthat provides excess energy
to cool the buildings.
There was a counter\nhistory here,
of course, where the modern\nproject in the equatorial
produced friction between\nthe aesthetic aspirations
of modernism and\nclimactic context.
Two projects, the\nFederal building
of Petaling Jaya and the\nKuala Lumpur Hospital--
these are really two\namong many in KL--
speak of this earlier\nmoment at the confluence
of global networks of modernism,\nthe end of colonialism,
and the impacts of\nequatorial calibration.
The Federal building shown\nhere-- designed by H.I.
Ashley and S.P. Merer of\nthe Colonial Public Works
Department in 1958--
in the new town\nof Petaling Jaya.
It's a suburban model about 10\nkilometers south of KL proper.
The building known as\nthe National Registration
Department is a long\nhorizontal bar--
brawny in its opacity--
and it's positioned on an\neast-west axis following
the arc of the equatorial sun.
It's a six story\nrectangular block--
10 meters by 100 meters--
with a double-loaded corridor\ndown each of its floor plates.
The northern elevation continues\nthe grid-like checkerboard,
though larger in\nscale than the south
shown in the previous image.
Composed of a perpendicular\ngrid and vertical brise soleil,
opaque to the west
The thinness of the concrete\nbreeze block, the simplicity
of the pattern, and\nthe opacity produced
by a frontal orientation suggest\nan equal alternative aesthetic
sensibility.
While the west brise soleil\nmore open erroneously receives
the majority of the heat gain--
it's no wonder that the\nglass there is tinted black
as compensation--
the northern perforated envelope\nspeaks to a finer degree
of orientation.
The building was also\ndesigned, in this case,
with air conditioning\nfrom the very beginning--
as did the Sequis Center--
and suggests a hybrid\nbetween the opaque envelope
and the cooled interior.
Both buildings-- here in KL\nand what I showed in Jakarta--
foreshadow the shift of\natmospheric calibration
to a symbolic rather\nthan a performative one.
To which architecture begins\nto relinquish its capacity
to construct atmosphere,\ngiving it slowly away
to mechanical conditioning.
The aesthetics of\nopacity find perforation
in simple platonic\nforms, though still
for me suggest a friction\nand a possible permeability
with the city and its air.
I see here a scaffolding that\nsuggests both visual opacity
yet atmospheric porosity.
We see similar attempts\nin the KL hospital--
the most Le Corbusien\n-inspired of projects
throughout my travels.
Designed by Wells\nand Joyce, to which
Maxwell Fry was the\ncompetition judge who
selected this scheme in 1961.
Maxwell Fry and\nJane Drew, it should
be noted, worked with\nCorbusier to enable Chandigarh
and later established\ntheir practices in Ghana--
which I'll show a little\nbit in a few minutes.
The hospital must be\nseen in this lineage
and was built from 1962 to 1968.
The largest building is the\nGeneral Operations and Surgery
Center being a composition\nof bars and blocks,
overhead linkways, and pilotis.
Corbusien touches are found\nthroughout the egg crate
envelope--
curve and linear light\nfittings on the bases,
compositional arrangement,\nand the scale and depth
of the brise soleil makes\nthis building stylistically
aligned with the larger\nmovement of modernism
as it confronted the tropical\nfrom the late '30s onward.
But the scale of the envelope\nalong with the relatively deep
floor plates became\nrepositories.
Repositories for excess,\nfor excess furniture,
excess compressors, excess\nhumidity, and excess hot air
itself.
The details maybe are\nsomewhat generic by now--
deep elevations in screens\nproud of the building masses.
But operating as a\nthick blanket of air
evacuated from the interior\nrather than buffering
the heat load of the sun.
The [inaudible] building, just\nadjacent to this Le Corbusien
manifestation, seemed\nmore banal but suggests
a more complex narrative\nof atmospheric calibration.
A thin bar building--\none board deep,
largely naturally\nventilated-- even today
suggests a tighter\nintegration to atmosphere.
The [inaudible] windows\nbehind the concrete screen
work in unison with\nthe larger exoskeleton
to ventilate and calibrate\nthe atmosphere that moves
across the narrow floor plate.
The symmetry, narrow plan depth,\nand relatively deep screen
illustrate an\nelevational building
confronting its context.
Imagining a hospital\nof natural integration
rather than mechanical\nconditioning.
All with a nice shade of\npink to top it all off.
The campus is slowly\nbeing aggregated together
into larger building volumes,\nas a continuous interior is
demanded by doctor and patient\nexpectations of modern--
a.k.a.
temperate-- sensibilities.
By doing so, architecture\nis rendered in this case
as a purveyor of increased real\nestate, floor plate capacity,
and fire egress\ncompliance, rather than
enabling friction between\npeople, atmosphere,
and architecture.
The traces of modernism\nand the brise soleil
that we find in the\nelevations of Jakarta and KL
are picked up again in one of\nthe most delicately preserved
and thoughtful artifacts that\nI discovered during my travels.
Located four hours\nsouth of Chennai
on the east coast of India,\nfacing the Bay of Bengal
and the city of Pondicherry.
The small city of\n3/4 of a million
was a colony of the French East\nIndia Company from 1674 onward.
The legacies of\nFrench colonial rule
are imprinted deep into the\ncity's formal structure.
A grid plan running\nperpendicular
to the sea with an\noblong ring road
marks the separation between\nthe formal French corridor
and its expanding\nTamil periphery.
The city is split between\nthis visible French influence
and the higher densities\nof aggregation to the west.
Between neoclassical buildings\nwith generous courtyards
and the party wall\nconstruction of density
where the majority of the\nresidential and business areas
are located.
The city is not a\ncity of roofs as we
found in Semarang or\nPalembang, nor elevations
as in Jakarta or KL, but a\nseries of mid-scale masses.
Three to five stories in\nheight, a tightly-compacted
high-density arrangement.
The gridded city has a\nstrange emptied feeling.
For over 100 buildings are\nnow owned by the Sri Aurobindo
Ashram--
one of the most important\nashrams in India.
Imagine a city of\nwhispering yogis--
this is Pondicherry.
The Golconde dormitory\ndesigned by Antonin Raymond,
Francoise Sommer,\nGeorge Nakashima
between 1935 and 1942, marks\nthe first modern cast-in-place
building in India.
The design deploys a series\nof tropical modern motifs
that we found in KL, though\nthey were developed here almost
20 years earlier.
A bar building displaced about\na vertical stair core, situated
precisely along a\neast-west axis in alignment
to the tropical sun path.
The collision of the building\nagainst a tilting city grid
appears object-like,\nyet a perimeter wall
with a single entry door\ncamouflages the intelligence
behind.
The superimposition of\nthe two orientations
creates three courtyards--
two northern hot courtyards\nand a southern cool courtyard.
The northern courtyard heats\nup in the afternoon creating
a low pressure, while the\nsouthern courtyard as shaded
creates a high pressure because\nof his lower temperature.
The differential\nbetween these volumes
creates a velocity of\nair moving laterally
across the architecture.
The building still operates\nas a dormitory to the ashram
and getting access was\nextremely cumbersome.
With profuse self-chastisement\nin the basement
as a prerequisite\nfor my entry, I
ended up bowing for\nforgiveness to a sin
I wasn't quite aware of to a\nvery large rotund Indian woman
named Suman.
It was really hard to\nget into this building.
The asbestos cement\nscreen set in a grid form
is all in off-white concrete.
Surprisingly thin and easy to\nmove by cast brass hardware.
Two gaps on the\nground floor allow air
to move between the bar\nat relatively high speeds,
making it the ideal foyer for\nresting in the hot afternoon.
So there's a gap there\nand there and everyone
sits there to cool off.
Ventilation is throughout,\nproviding shade even
for the casual street-side rest.
Within the architecture\nproper, a lamination
of screen, veranda, corridor, a\nsliding panel, dormitory room,
and window bay all\nfunction holistically.
The finishes are\nlargely natural allowing
the thermal mass\nof each material
to comfort the interior.
Exposed slabs modulate\nair temperature
while dark floors\nminimize glare.
The furniture within the room is\nconstructed in teak and rattan,
speaking of a language of moving\nair around and about the body.
Designed by George\nNakashima, it directly
foreshadows his future\nas a furniture maker
in Pennsylvania.
The staircase-- open in the\ncenter and ventilated on both
sides--
drives air and light deep\ninto the architecture.
Details are expressive\nand subtle simultaneously.
Even brass inlays-- you can\nsee them in the plaster here--
allow the wall to breathe\nbetween it's hot outside
and cooler inside,\nmitigating thermal expansion
of the plaster itself.
Screens when adjusted\nallow light or view
and can be closed for\nthe tropical rain.
The roof likewise a doubling--
an enlarged tile roof\nwith integrated drainage
and perforated ends\nto cross-ventilate
the main building mass.
The details are exquisite\nin their execution
and the superb upkeep\nthanks to Amra Nemenberry,
who inherited the\ncustodianship from her father--
the original caretaker\nof the building as part
of the early ashram.
When I visited only\ntwo other guests
were staying in the dormitory\nwith a contingent staff
keeping the operation running.
The roof washing area--
elevated, shown here--\nto catch the thermals
off the ocean in the\nafternoon, drying clothes
on a series of cables with\nintegrated drainage below.
The solidity of the\narchitecture camouflages
a perforated envelope\noutside and in.
But it is also the integration\nof the components from the RC
slabs--
the reinforced concrete slabs--
to the doubling of the roof\nas a cushioned thermal buffer,
to the dynamics of\npressure differentials
across the courtyard that\nembolden the atmosphere
and architecture alike.
The building speaks of\nanother important narrative
of contemporary equatorial\nurbanization discussed
during my travels.
The exquisite construction of\nthis building in the late 1930s
sits in contrast to the\nrelatively crude fabrication
recently underway\nin nearby Pondi.
Or in Chennai from\nwhere I landed.
The narrative is\nthat as craftsmen
became replaceable labor, as\nthey saw higher laborers wages
in Dubai, Saudi Arabia, or\nSingapore from the '70s onward.
The result has been that in\nthis part of Tamil, India,
construction knowledge\nhas been emptied out
by the global flows of\ncapital and labor alike.
And the transference\nof expertise
through apprenticeship ruptured.
Today local architects\nclaim that the Golconde
would be near impossible.
For the basic\nbuilding intelligence
has been shipped elsewhere,\nand the knowledge and care
of building exported across\nthe equator without return.
This is a photograph\nin Singapore
of labor coming from India.
We pick up the traces of\nthe Golconde dormitory
in the city of Accra, Ghana--
on the north of the Gulf of\nGuinea, five degrees north
of the equator.
The city has a\npopulation of 2.5 million
in the sprawling metropolis\nof mid-scale architecture
with Ghanaian, colonial,\nand now Chinese influences.
The city is pregnant with\nmid-century experiments that
decorate and sheathe big\nroof and deep elevation
buildings, with a variety of\nbrise soleils, breeze blocks,
overhangs, and patterns.
From mid-scale towers\nto academic campuses--
from government compounds\nto the single family home--
the city was a laboratory\nfor tropical exuberance
during its hangover\nfrom colonialism.
When Kwame Knrumah, Ghana's\nhis first prime minister,
recruited architects to\nconstruct an identity
in physical form for his\nscientific socialism.
A making of a country through\narchitecture and making
of the city.
The traces are\neverywhere in Accra.
From Nixon [inaudible] and\npartners National Archives
building from 1959, to\nthe delicate breeze blocks
of the Accra Central Library--
financed by the British Council\nin 1954 by the same firm.
For the naturally\nventilated reading
rooms and bookcases\nalong the perimeters
allow hot air to move across\nits elevation, illustrating
invention and adaptation even\nif wall-mounted fan coils seem
a new contemporary addition.
Even if they don't\nwork when you visit.
So ventilation\noccurs really here
and these are the new additions.
The legacies of Maxwell\nFry and Jane Drew--
like many other largely\nexpatriate architects
are throughout Ghana, both\nfrom British, American,
and Eastern Bloc countries.
Here in Cape Coast,\nby Fry and Drew,
where a road slips\nunder academic block
as we saw in the\nKL General Hospital
half a world away\nbuilt a decade earlier.
Or the generic screened\nmid-century apartment
buildings, where the aesthetics\nof concrete, modernism,
and climate merge together.
Even if it's coated in a\nfine shade of weathered mold.
Two projects represent\nthis intertwining
of international networks\ncolonialism and independence,
with the politics of\nthe Cold War played out
in spatial and\narchitectural terms.
The first project is the\nInternational Trade Fair
building from '62 to '67--
designed by Vic [? agabi, ?]\na Ghanaian, Jacek Chyrosz
and Stanislaw Rymaszewski.
The later both being Polish.
Built through the Ghana National\nConstruction Corporation
as a statement of Ghana's\nshift to the Eastern Bloc
as it tried to balance\nits influencers
in a Pan-African sensibility.
The large modernist\ncompositional plan
located on the northeast of\nthe city near the airport
flanks Labadi road to the west.
So we're going to look--
Archival images\nfrom the Trade Fair
illustrate a composition\nof modernism, foregrounded
by an indigenous hut and a\nBucky Fuller geodesic dome
with a glowing\nUSA sign included.
The current fairgrounds reflect\nthe traces of these legacies
and the embedded\nconfidence of independence
shown in large bold letters:\n"Buy made in Ghana goods."
The fairground entryways,\nramps, and bridges
speak of a moment of\noptimism, paralleled
in the architectural\nmilieu of the time.
Maxwell Fry stated, and I quote,\n"I have practiced architecture
at a time when architects were\nfull of hope and optimism.
At a time when we\nfelt that the changes
in planning and in architecture\nwould change living conditions
and improve the world.
A time when there was\ngreat hope for the future."
Today the buildings remain as\ntraces of their formal selves,
though still used for political\nand religious gatherings.
Or for the banality of storage.
The trade hall\nbuilding is composed
of a large-span reinforced\nconcrete structure that
holds up a lightweight\ncorrugated metal roof
exaggerating by its doubling.
Similar to what we saw in\nthe Golconde dormitory.
The diamond shaped profile\nof corrugated metal sheet--
itself a ubiquitous\nequatorial material--
works here as a double.
Top for thermal,\nbottom for rain.
Between the layers the hot air\nis exhausted out the diamond
profile, as though architecture\nis placing the thrusted hot air
onto a pedestal.
The dramatics of the cantilever\nand strong visual identity
are throughout the architecture,\nextending and pushing
air as though it's a cushion\nto be squeezed and pulled.
The seven meter long\ncantilevers extend
toward the edges of the\npodium on both sides,
ejecting rainwater from the\ndouble roof to the perimeter
beyond.
The mediums of atmosphere--
rain, air, and breeze--
suggest a palette of elements\nworking together with material
to construct the architecture.
The open-ended profile\nimplies that the roof system
could continue onward, covering\nthe fairground in its totality.
While the emptiness\nof the grounds
and the westward neighborhood\nbake in the hot afternoon,
for architecture\nand vegetation is
belittled to the scale of sky.
The heat is in contrast to\nthe relative comfort of shade
provided by the big roof.
The podium is highly opaque\nyet perforated at its base--
pressurizing air to create a\ncontinuous cross-ventilation
within the hall.
Traces of Ghana's\noptimism and independence
remain throughout\nthe architecture,
as though sign and symbol.
As architecture imagined\nas a positive force
and an ambitious future.
It's a dramatic\nlanguage of atmosphere
through a pillowed roof,\nexpressive drainage,
and the ambitions of a nation.
The second building-- located\nwithin the political dynamics
of Ghana--
is the Ministry of\nWomen and Children
in the former US\nEmbassy building,
designed by Harry\nWeese and Associates.
The building is\na big roof type--
overhanging and protecting\na second story office
set back from the street in\nthe tropically calibrated
low-rise aggregation\nof the center city.
The building's\nsquare form is set
on a series of\ncruciform concrete legs,
the second story mahogany\nenclosure perforated
by a screen of timber.
The blue roof is a new addition.
The large pilotis veranda\nsits as a thick pad of air--
performing as a vestibule\nto the ministry above.
The large overhanging roof\ninsulates the building
in shadow, while\ntraces of the temperate
in the original design have\nbeen compensated for by a canopy
that was added above the stair.
Drainage by that\nthick blue roof--
which you can see\non the edges here.
A plexiglass parapet\nprotecting the interior veranda
from wind-driven rain\nis also a new addition.
And as the original\nclear story seemed
perfectly dimensioned to\nhide a series of fan coils--
along with a lovely\nMerry Christmas sign
blazing in the hot afternoon--\nsuggests a curious mix
of climactic visions.
But like the International\nTrade Fair building-- air, sun,
and material are\nthe main mediums
that produce the architecture.
The detailing is\nexpressive and considered
throughout with tapered\nstair treads picking up
the sensibility of the\nfolded plate profile we
see in the Trade Fair building.
Accra, because of its historical\ntrajectory, is in many way
a collection of these\nmid-century modernist pieces.
At a particular\nconfluence between Africa,
the Cold War, where\narchitecture became a device
to construct identity in\nthe production of symbols
of nationalism, independence,\nand political agency.
The critique, of course, is\nthat the resulting architecture
is a form of cultural\nand global imperialism--
largely from the\ntemperate-- given
that the vast majority of these\narchitects were not from Ghana.
Were male, largely white,\nmaybe with the exceptions
of Max Bond and Jane Drew.
All of these stories, though,\nare intimately intertwined,
I would say in this\nplayground the tropical.
I just have two more, I'll\nbe done in a few minutes.
My travels continued to\nSao Paulo as my interest
in the deep envelope and\ntransformation of the city
from the horizontal\nto the vertical.
Sao Paulo is a city\nof infinite towers,
a field of points\nseemingly undifferentiated
across this geological plateau.
The city defies\neasy categorization.
A city of massive proportions--
economic disparity\nof immense range--
yet the city is a\ntreasure trove of
the modern, thick, heavy\narchitecture exploring
density, climate, and context.
The legacies of which\npercolate from west to east
across the tropical\nin countless ways.
Where undulations of density\nare almost imperceptible due
to the continuous\nextent of the city.
In Brazil I travel to\nmore known projects
in my desire to understand\nthe Brazilian experience
with the tropical.
The Edificio Copan\nfrom '51 to '57--
designed by Oscar Niemeyer\nand recently published
in The New York Times--
marks a resurgence of the city.
Not just as an artistic\nartifact that we may say
was glorified by Andreas Gursky\nand his well-known composition
from 2002, but really as a\nsocioeconomic marker of a newly
cleaned up center city.
In my own experience, cleaned\nup is a relative word.
And as though I\nwasn't mugged, it
was clear that the neighborhood\nwas still highly challenged
and my camera was really\nan object of envy.
The building is dramatic,\nthough, not just
for its curvilinear\nprofile or its size,
but architecturally at the\ndepth and scale of its envelope.
A two meter deep by\none meter high band
of horizontal louvers--
three high per apartment--
coat the northwest elevation.
These are enormous--\nas space itself.
As a separate element\nthe brise soleil
does not transmit heat\nload into the slabs proper.
And it's relatively\nlight color acts
has both a sunshade, light\nshelf, and wind funnels
simultaneously.
This blue netting\nis a new addition.
The building is currently\nveiled to contain the falling
ceramic tiles that were\noriginally deployed
on the concrete to resist\nthe mold and algae.
Though now is a kind\nof hazard to passerbys,
as you can imagine\nthe tiles falling off.
The apartments of a variety\nof one and two units deep,
allow air to move from\none elevation to another.
From the unified deep\nelevation we saw with the blue,
to the melange of\nthe compositional
of the southeastern\nfacade shown here.
The building as a vertical city\nworks as a pole of population--
a barometric vessel of the\ndownward or upward trajectories
of the city's fortune.
Aggregating and\nspilling populations
into the nearby neighborhoods.
In contrasting context from\nthe Edificio Copan building--
the faculty of\narchitecture and urbanism
at the University of Sao Paulo\nis situated in a garden campus
setting.
Designed by Joao Vilanova\nArtigas from '61,
it's located in the western\nside of the city in a canopy
of large rain trees.
Which ironically have\nbeen imported to Singapore
where I live, and populate\nthe majority of the campus
at the National University\nof Singapore where I teach.
The building is stunning\nnot for its large commons
as a social space or the\ndramatic ramps that provide
for vertical circulation.
These are all well known\nin architectural circles.
Nor from the big roof that\noperates as a structure,
drainage, and lighting device.
It's really a super\nstudio imagination
if there ever was one.
But for the subtle details\nof the thick big roof
as a device to\nplunge air vertically
rather than horizontally.
The big roof\nselectively isolates
and modifies\natmosphere filtering
through the architecture.
It's a subtle performance\nlargely overlooked
in published descriptions.
The large studio space is\nreally two double trays.
One is a kind of roof\nand exterior wall,
the second has an\ninterior tray--
an internal wall-- that squeeze\nhot air between the two.
And I'll give you a clue\nof this little trough
that you see along the length.
This trough gives rise\nto the performance
as a gap runs along\nboth the elevations.
And you can see it again here.
Air plunges downward and\nupward through this gap
between those two walls--
an exhausting of moving air\nand sound and smell alike.
The [inaudible] high inner wall\nof the slippage, which is here,
dampens the sound to a whisper--\nso basically air is moving up
and down across\nthese two walls--
while traces of the\ninterior gives clues
to the inhabitation above.
It's as though the architecture\nis a lung that breathes.
Inhaling and exhaling on\na 24 hour student cycle.
A subtle puckering of exterior\nwall to interior kiss--
imagining merging the\ntwo trays together.
And the porosity of the\nentry operates not just
for circulation, but rather\nas a large-scale plunger
that pushes air within.
Exhausting through those\nslots along its perimeter.
The final location I visited\non this long arc of travel
is Joao.
A small city 400 kilometers\nnorthwest of San Paulo.
A city of 150,000 people.
An agricultural town\nreminiscent of the Midwest
in the United States.
And like the slow emptiness\nof a Jim Jarmusch film,
we find in Joao's center another\nbig roof project by Artigas
from '73.
The draw bus depot fits into\nthe [? overa ?] of Artigas' work
as the big roof--
as an urban bus exchange--\nnavigating a sloped site
and connecting one block\nto another by architecture.
One city to another\nby transportation.
The large roof of\nArtigas' depot contrast
against the surrounding\nsmaller scale aggregate
fabric and the horizontality\nof the geography.
The city has grown both\nlaterally as well as
vertically.
But it's the large big roof\nthat has a compelling presence,
reinforcing an almost Wrightean\nvision of a broad acre city.
Within the perforation\nof the horizontal plane
by skylights and the formal\nand structural gymnastics
of the column, capital,\nand slab intersect
with the broad and long ramps--
speak of a parallel sensibility\nwith the FAU building.
Air moves laterally\nwhile sunlight
is diffused vertically.
The bus depot is a doubling.
A deep occupiable volume\nof ramps and circulation
as a second story.
Perforated by two\nlarge flanking entries.
One for pedestrian,\nbus, and air alike.
The top roof-- layered above and\nset proud with torque columns--
squeeze air and light between a\nkind of tight 2.7 meter space.
The ramps and openings\nbetween these layers
operate as a thermal\nand circulatory straw--
moving air and people\nacross the topography
and mixing them in a dynamic\nzone of interference.
Pedestrians, cars, streets,\nsidewalks, and busways
all intermingle in this space\nof congestion in compression.
Where people in circulation,\nticketing and selling,
air and large buses\ncriss-crossing the vast
agricultural\nhinterland of Brazil--
all mix together.
It's a big roof typology.
Not for the buying\nand selling of goods,
but the moving of\nbodies and things.
I see the legacies of\nKarsten in Semarang--
traveling to Joao\nacross the equator--
in an interplay of\nair, atmosphere,
architecture, in the city.
As bookends to my grand\ntour of the equator,
I was impressed\nby the simplicity
and robust physicality of\nthe large roofs of Karsten
and Artigas alike.
The reductive quality of the\nbig roof as a public and social
project, the integration\nof architecture,
the economy of\nmaterial, and the mixing
of architecture, the\ncity, and atmosphere
simultaneously suggest a\ntheory of equatorial porosity
and maybe contamination.
A friction with the expansive\nmediums of architecture
and urbanism alike.
In both Karsten\nand Artigas I find
an atmospheric\n[? poshay ?] of sorts.
A viscous, almost aquatic,\npresence to the air.
Heavy and full of\nphysicality that
is netted by the\narchitecture of the big roof
or between the deep elevation.
Whereas the temperate thickens\nwith stone, masonry, concrete,
or insulation--
or utilizes technology to\nmake separate and distinct
the atmospheres of\ninterior and exterior--
the equatorial medium\nis the hot and wet air.
A vocabulary for\ndesigning architecture
and refiguring the city\nas permeable rather than
separated.
Perforated rather than sealed.
In the cities that\nI traveled to I
found a great and often\nvery intense struggle.
Rapid demographic pressures,\nimpacts of climate change,
and capital aggregation are\ncreating immense pressures
across the equator.
And it's easy to\nsee these places
at sites of temperate fantasy.
For easy importation of\nconstruction systems,
mechanical and\ninfrastructural implants,
and transformations into\nvisions of the global north.
But by resisting\nclimactic replacement
and working where architecture\nconfronts the issues of density
growth and permeability, another\nvision for the equatorial city
is possible.
I've painted through\nthis arc of travel
as though there is a kind of\nlarge meta narrative here.
Maybe in some ways there is--
a narrative of the\ninterplay between modernism,
internationalism, atmosphere,\nand developmental pressure.
This sets the foundation for\nurbanism across the equator.
But it's also a collage\nof the micro narratives--
of friction and struggle, of\ninterference intelligence,
of the equatorial which\nrubs up against the flows
of global homogenisation.
The long histories\nof colonialism
and the contemporary challenges\nof rapid growing cities.
Mid 20th century architecture on\nthe equator offers a complex--
sometimes inspiring and often\nconflicted-- history lesson.
All of which are being\nstill played out today
despite its rapid erasure.
My travels have in\nmany ways just begun,
as there are so many\nfascinating projects in cities
that I have yet to\nextend my research to.
From [? pompen ?] to Colombo\nto [? dar el ?] Salam to Lagos.
To Belem and Manos.
I look forward to a\ndeeper investigations
of the hot and wet.
If atmosphere is the glue\nthat permeates both the city
and architecture-- that\nin equatorial urbanization
it's imperative to think\nof this city architecture
and atmosphere together.
As a climactic and\ncultural medium
that impacts both\nthe aggregation
of building and maybe the\narchitectural envelope.
This research for\nme has just started.
My practice is still\nwrestling with these concerns
in each of my projects.
But this amazing grand\ntour of the torrid,
enabled by the\nWheelwright Prize,
has laid a foundation for\na life of future work.
Thank you.
[applause]
That was beautiful.
It's an enormous\namount of material.
You took most of\nthe photographs?
Oh, do we have runners?
Yeah, we do.
You took most of\nthe photographs.
Did you take all\nof the photographs?
Not all of them.
Some of them were taken also by\nsome students that I travelled
with.
You mentioned one Gursky,\nbut that's not the Gursky--
No, no, that one--
He took the photograph\nof the building.
Yes, yeah.
So that photograph--\nthose are taken by drones.
Some of these shots\nare taken by drones.
I would take some of\nthe photographs myself,
sometimes students\nwould help me.
Also, especially to get\naccess that was very helpful.
But the photographs\nof the Edificio Copan
are all taken by a drone.
That way I was able to get\nwith people in Sao Paulo,
so we were able\nto fly it around.
The photographs of the\nmarkets, for example,
are now invaluable it seems.
And that was just\nluck of timing?
Yeah, it was kind\nof an amazing story.
I could probably give\na whole lecture just
on the Semarang market\nor the Pasar Cinde.
Because it just happened that\nthe timing was like this.
I mean, literally, in\nthe original proposal
I wanted to go see the market\nin its kind of operation.
And I'd just heard about it and\nliterally a few weeks after we
spoke on the phone there was\na huge fire and totally kind
of changed maybe the\nlens in which I went.
But yet it opened up so many\nquestions because of it.
Because it became such a site\nof contestation in the city.
Some of the buildings--
the architects are\nknown if not famous.
But in the existing literature,\nare the climatic issues
talked about at all?
Like in Artigas-- does\nexisting literature
treat it purely as a sort\nof Brazilian modernism
and talk about it in\ntypical art history terms?
I'm definitely not an expert.
Let's say that.
I don't come at it from a\nhistorical point of view.
There might be techs who\ntalk about it, but in my kind
of cursory reading--
it's talked more about\nthe social space, the kind
of muscularity to the concrete.
And rarely is those\nslots and the way
that it kind of\nperforms atmospherically
really discussed.
And I thought that was such an\nimportant part of the project.
In the readings-- when I was\ndoing some kind of preliminary
research and also actually\nstarted drawing it--
there's no real\ndiscussion on that.
And it was only by looking\nat other photographs--
I said, hey, that\nlooks kind of weird.
I'm curious what that was.
And then by going there\nit kind of revealed itself
to the kind of\ninherent performance
that is going on inside.
So your description of the\nway the buildings breathe--
this is all through\njust observation then?
Yes.
And how did you--
are those measured drawings?
Or those are guess\ndrawings from photographs?
Because the drawings\nare also extraordinary,
almost as extraordinary\nas the photographs.
Some of it's measured.
The ones that I could\ntake quick dimensions.
But it wasn't like I was\ngoing around doing an accurate
survey.
Just from photographs--
It's from photographs.
From my own experience of going\nthere, taking quick dimensions,
getting a general sense and\nkind of reconstructing it.
I had a bit of a hard time at\nfirst reading the drawings.
I thought they were--
and were they-- sometimes\nmultiple folded?
Or were they always--
So I think the details always\nhave two-- one is a worm's eye
and one's at an\nax in the metric.
Especially on the roof\nprojects because--
to see the top of the roof\nis also really important
as to see the underside.
So those kind of oscillate.
The other drawings are\ntypically worm's-eye.
Some of them are obliques.
I keep working with\ndifferent projections
to try to foreground the\nway the architecture is kind
of integrating with atmosphere.
And taking the projection\nwhich shows that
the most compelling way.
So let's have some comments\nand questions right here.
Yeah.
Thanks.
And thanks for that really\nnice trip around the globe.
That was really fun.
And I agree the photographs\nand the drawings
were really amazing and\nreally brought you there.
I think my question is--
as you mentioned and\nit was just discussed.
It's a collection of buildings\nby northern hemisphere
architects, by and large, in\nthis particular post-colonial
mid-century moment.
And that made me wonder--\nfirst of all, if they
were universally successful.
Or if there was a little\nbit of an element of a North
American or European\narchitect coming and doing
a tropical project, and\nmaybe making a mistake
because he's not familiar\nwith that atmosphere?
The other part of my\nquestion is about looking
at this very specific\npoint in time,
where all these buildings\ncame into being.
And what were some\nof the antecedents
and where did that\ngo afterwards?
Is there a second generation of\nperhaps indigenous architects
who adopted some modernism,\nwho were influenced
by these buildings locally?
Did you see any of that?
And are you expanding\nthis sort of time horizon
of the entire research to look\nat before and look at after?
So the first part\nof your question
is whether there were some\nkind of failures, let's say.
And obviously there\nwere-- for instance,
the kind of most obvious is\nthe Harry Weese USA embassy,
where all of a sudden these new\ncanopies go on because you had
rains and they only stair up.
If it doesn't have a cover,\nit kind of doesn't work.
I think there are\nthose kind of frictions
between the kind of modern\naesthetics, let's say,
that come from the temperate.
And when they hit the\ntropical, that's not always
a logical combination.
And so where that struggle\nhappens is actually for me
very interesting.
Predominantly, I think more as\na kind of personal reflection
on myself.
I grew up in the temperate, I\nwas educated in the temperate.
My kind of\narchitectural vocabulary
was largely temperate centric.
And that in a way\nI've had to kind
of unlearn certain languages as\nI've practiced on the equator.
Definitely some of my\ncolleagues in Singapore
would say that I still\nhaven't unlearned enough.
But maybe that's\nan ongoing thing.
The second question was--
what is the larger context?
So, yes, most of\nthese projects are
done at that moment where\nmodernism confronts.
And I think that that was\nsomething very interesting
for me.
Rather than going into the\nvernacular or the very local
architecture which has a\nlong and robust history,
and I would say two things.
One is maybe just as a\nkind of mode of research--
is a little bit more difficult\nand more inaccessible.
Either due to language or\nnot enough research on it.
Or it's really not\nmy area of expertise.
And I also thought that those\nmaybe more indigenous projects
are--
at least let's say\npre- this period--
deal with architecture not\nso much in an urban way.
That might be in\nthe kind of village
and don't offer a kind of\na language, let's say, that
works with the contemporary\nissues of the city.
So I was kind of really\ntrying to be selfish in a way.
Maybe it's also retrospectively\na kind of reflection
on myself having moved\nnow to the tropical.
So I was maybe looking at some\nof these as more of lessons--
positive and negative.
There is, of course, a\nwhole robust conversation
after this period.
Done by-- let's say more, I\nwould say local architects.
Or architects who kind of\ncame out of colonialism
and develop their own\narchitectural languages.
It's a huge field\nonto its own and goes
in many different\ntrajectories depending
on what nation you were in.
And each one kind of\nwent in their own way.
For this kind of research--
I haven't talked about that.
I think there's tons\nof research being done
on that kind of later period.
And I think this period is--
at least from maybe\nmy own generation
or at least in my own\neducation, I would say--
not so discussed.
And I think it was discussed\nbecause in post-colonialism
there was--
in a way, this was a kind of\nstill caught up in colonialism.
And so people didn't\nwant to talk about it
because they were\ntrying to construct
a kind of new sense of identity.
So they looked to their own\narchitects or other sources
of inspiration.
So I'm kind of maybe going back\nand reflecting on this period
a little bit more intensely.
Is there a question here?
Oh, oh, you have mic.
Sorry, sorry, I thought--
Thank you so much for\nsharing your wonderful work.
My question is whether\nyou were able to perceive
noticeable differences within\nthe concrete from country
to country?
I'd like to think of concrete\nas a sort of native material
because it has the\npotential to be produced
within each country,\nand sort of transcend
the global economic\nsupply chain.
Definitely.
I think the whole\nway that it's cast,
the way that it's\ndealt with is all
done in a very different\nway in each country.
So for instance, in the\nPasar Johar literally
you see the rattan\nformwork and the imprint
of all of that patterning into\nthe underside of the slabs.
Where in Brazil you see kind\nof wide plank board form
concrete because of the kind\nof accessibility to timber
that is there.
So there is a kind of--
let's say local vernacular--\nembedded into the concrete,
depending on where\nand how it was done.
And it's probably a research\nproject all on its own.
Probably, yeah, maybe if I\nwent back as a second tour
I could look more\nclosely at that
but it's definitely evident.
Here we know because\nthis building has just
been-- some of the\nconcrete had to be
replaced, along with\nthe reinforcing steel.
That this climate,\nI think, is not
great for\npour-in-place concrete.
But the tropics you don't\nhave the same kind of--
the steel doesn't seem\nto rust so quickly.
Is that true?
It seems like a very good\nmaterial for the tropics.
I've never heard of\nthe rebar rusting.
I always say that--
this is my own little thing--
I always say like\nPaul Rudolph is really
a tropicalist at heart.
And the Boston government\ncenter building--
you know, it's\nhorrible in Boston
but it would be\namazing in Singapore.
And actually the\nirony is that he's
started to do some of his--
after being\nlambasted by Venturi,
kind of had a second\ncareer in Southeast Asia.
And did some amazing projects\nin Singapore and in Indonesia,
where the kind of language\nin which he was working in
was so--
it just makes total sense.
I was even walking this\nmorning to the Carpenter Center
and it makes total\nsense on the equator.
It doesn't make\ntotal sense here.
All those underside plazas\nwould be occupied all the time
on the equator, but\nhere maybe they're
occupied in August if that.
Yeah, yeah, if that.
Another?
Thank you, Erik, for your\nreally amazing research.
And I just have a quick\nquestion about whether you
have sort of research on\nthe on the local level.
Have you done any\nsurvey on the people?
For example, not\njust their opinions
on those sort of alien language\nof architecture but also
they're sort of\ntypes of behavior,
the sort of the change?
Or whether it's a good\nor bad kind of thing
brought into the vernacular?
Because it is like a\nvery alien language
and I am wondering\nif that vernacular--
when we talk about\nvernacular architecture--
is it just dealing\nwith the atmosphere?
Is it just dealing\nwith the climate?
And how do people or\nthe locals sort of
respond to that on a\nexperiential or mental level?
I know you talked about\nthe Semarang market a lot--
the type of rendering\nthat's going on there.
For other projects,\nhave you done?
Of course I had a\nlot of conversations
during my travels.
And each location has\ntheir own kind of take.
The Karsten projects are\nvery conflicted because they
were built at the\ntime of colonialism--
this is pre- World War 2.
And for me what I thought was\nthe most interesting thing
was that they are now being seen\nis kind of important vestiges
to hold onto.
I almost sense that probably\nthe generation before
would probably have\nbeen fine to erase it.
To erase those legacies\nof colonialism.
Now they look back almost--
at least the people I've talked\nto-- almost in a nostalgic way.
And want to preserve.
So the Semarang market\nwill be preserved.
Well, we saw what happened\nin Pasar Cinde, that's
not being preserved.
In KL-- that kind of\nmid-century modernism
is also being looked at by\nlocal architects and people
in a kind of celebratory way.
The Malaysian\nInstitute of architects
actually did a\nexhibition just recently
on some of these projects and\nhas a kind of wonderful book--
I think it's called\nLiving Machines.
So clearly they are\nalso looking back
at this moment with\na kind of fondness.
In Accra, I think there's\nthe beginning of that.
Pondicherry-- that building\nis just so wonderful.
I think it's really celebrated,\nbut because it still
operates as an ashram\nit doesn't have
that kind of public\naccessibility.
So it's seen a little\nbit from a distance.
In Brazil, of course, there's a\nlong legacy of the celebration
of the [? polis ?] [? de ?]\n[? school ?] and the work
there.
So it's looked on\nquite favorably.
Again, we come back to\nthis question of even
like this building--
was seen as brutalism\nas a kind of problem.
In the tropics\nit's not a problem.
They work so well.
So it's never seen in those\nkind of pejorative terms.
And also I think because it is--
let's say contemporary--\nthere is a kind of, let's say,
legacy of the\ncontemporary meaning
the country is modernizing.
I think where it gets conflicted\nis when predominantly--
maybe more like in the\nGhanaian experience,
where the architects were\npredominantly from Europe--
either from the Eastern\nBloc or the Western.
Which maybe the volume of those\nprojects is a little too much.
Like there wasn't enough--
let's say Ghanaian voice--
in the work.
Of course that changed later.
I know in the case in\nChandigarh with Le Corbusier--
in Chandigarh or\nwith Le Corbusier--
not just the capital but\nthe whole city was designed.
Or [? khan ?] in\nDhaka Bangladesh.
In both those cases,\nI know too there's
real pride about\nthat architecture.
Because they call it:\nChandigarh is our planned city.
As opposed to sort of what\nwe would call informal.
And I think the fact-- and this\nis a case in the market too--
that it was built\nby locals, even
though it was designed\nby Europeans or America,
it was built by locals.
I think that probably\nmakes a huge difference
too in the acceptance, no?
Yeah and I think also--
definitely in the\nSemarang-- case
because it housed so many\nsmall-scale merchants.
It was the center.
And it served that way\nall the way up until 2015.
And it was such a\nrobust economic engine--
like as a kind of scaffolding.
That people really--\ndespite in photographs
I saw-- even in a worn\ndown state was still
seen in a very positive way.
And to develop it into a\nmall or some version of that
is seen as a kind of horror\nby the local merchants.
They just want their\ndamn market back.
Eric, thank you so much.
This was really great.
I hope you can come again\nand share this again.
Thank you.
[applause]
