Hello.
I'd like to-- is it working?
OK.
I'd like to thank you\nall for joining us
this evening for a talk\nby the British architect
Amanda Levete of Amanda\nLevete architects, or AL A.
But first, there are\na few announcements
to be made about a few upcoming\nevents as part of our larger
public lecture series\nhere at the GSD.
Please join us tomorrow\nat 6:30 PM right here
in Piper for our annual\nJohn T. Dunlop lecture
with Raphael Bostic,\nwho is the president
and CEO of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Atlanta.
Raphael will be discussing\nthe future of fair housing,
as this year marks the 50th\nanniversary of the passage
of the Fair Housing Act.
And then again on Thursday\nat 12:00, April the 12th
at noon in Gund\n123, there's going
to be a lecture by\narchitect Eric Parry.
He\'s going to deliver a\nlecture entitled "Webs, Plates,
Fists, and Gloves--
Designing with Metals\nin Architecture."
So it's truly an honor\nto be able to introduce
Amanda Levete this evening\nto the GSD community.
Amanda is founder and\nprincipal of AL A,
an international, award-winning\ndesign and architecture
studio in London.
Levete studied architecture at\nthe Architectural Association
and worked for Richard Rogers\nbefore joining Future Systems
as a partner in 1989.
At Future Systems, she realized\ngroundbreaking buildings,
including the Media Centre\nat Lord's Cricket Ground
and Selfridges department\nstore in Birmingham.
Here, I would like to underscore\nthe term "groundbreaking"
and to situate her\nwork in the context
of an architectural\ndiscourse at the time.
In the mid-'90s, while American\nacademics and architects wrote
and debated blobs and\ndigital processes,
something else was happening\nin the United Kingdom.
Levete's practice was\nrealizing a new architecture,
with double curvature,\ncomplex geometries,
and abandoning architecture's\nmodernist paradigms
of the past.
She challenged\narchitecture's fabrication,
and constructability, and\nultimately, its image.
Since its formation in 2009,\nAL A has completed projects
at the Victoria and Albert\nMuseum in 2017 in London,
the V&A's largest building\nproject in over 100 years;
the MAAT, Museum of Art,\nArchitecture, and Technology
in Lisbon in 2016,\ncommissioned by the EDP,
one of the world's\nforemost energy companies;
the Central Embassy in 2017,\na 1.5 million-square foot
luxury shopping mall\nand hotel in Bangkok
on the former grounds\nof the British embassy;
and then a 13-hectare\nmedia campus
masterplan in the\nheadquarters building for Sky
in 2016 in London and the\nMPavilion in 2015 in Melbourne.
While it is evident that\narchitecture and the practice
of building is at\nthe core of AL A,
other designworks such as\nlighting, seating, shelving,
cutlery, tables, and\nfurniture allow the studio
to advance form, material,\nand fabrication, which
has direct impacts back\non her architecture.
One additional\ndistinction that I
would like to make\nabout her work
would be about the role\nof architectural effects
in the real.
When fully constructed\nand inhabitable,
meaning real glass, real\ncladding, real surfaces,
real mass, her architecture\nreads less like a building
and more akin to a\ndigital rendering.
I believe to make\nthe real appear
unreal is no easy task,\nfueled by imagination,
rigorous detailing, and\na conceptual attitude
towards materiality.
Examples of these\narchitectural effects
include thousands of\nglittery disks glowing
in the context of\nBirmingham's industrial city,
or the elongated land form,\nplinth, and window massing that
reflects a Lisbon\nwaterfront, or the insertion
of a pleated plaza into the\nGrade I-listed V&A museum.
All of her architecture fits\ninto its immediate context
but suggests a new, incredible,\nculturally engaging world
unto itself.
Levete's accomplishment in\ncontemporary architecture can
be noted by the many\nawards she's received,
including the 2018 Jane\nDrew Prize for women
in architecture; a CBE, which\nI am going to spell this out--
it's Commander of\nthe British Empire--
in recognition of her\nservices to architecture
recognized by the Queen of\nEngland; and an RIBA Stirling
prize in 1999.
Please join me in\nwelcoming Amanda Levete.
[applause]
Well, thank you so much, and\nthank you for inviting me.
I was actually here\nmore than 25 years ago
with my former\npartner, Jan Kaplicky.
And we came to give a talk.
And they'd forgotten\nthat it was, like,
the day before hand-in,\nand there was just
a handful of people.
And it was so difficult.
But here I am,\nback in a new guise
as principal of my own office.
I say my own office, but I\nhave three directors from three
different continents.
It's a very-- we are 50 people.
It's a very collaborative place.
And for me, this slide\nspeaks of who we are
and the culture of our office.
It's a messy pile of shoes.
It speaks of the very\ndifferent individuals
that make up our studio.
But it also talks about a\nsense of common endeavor
and common purpose.
And when you take off your\nshoes, you strip away a layer.
It creates a very\ninformal way of working
and maybe an informal\nway of designing.
And there's a kind of\nsubliminal message to clients
as they come in the door\nand they're politely
asked to take their\nshoes off, which
is, you're not in\nfor a passive ride.
We're all in this together.
And for me, that is\nincredibly important.
And it underpins the\nculture of our office.
And by the way,\ntaking your shoes off
also keeps the carpet cleaner.
So I'm going to start with\nMAAT, the Museum of Art,
Architecture, and\nTechnology, which we
completed in October of 2016.
It's in the most\nfantastic site in Lisbon,
the westernmost part of Europe.
And Lisbon is a\ncity whose identity
has been formed\nthrough its geography.
So it's a very\noutward-looking society.
It's a very tolerant\nsociety because it
looks back not just to Europe,\nbut it looks to Africa,
to South America.
It's from where the\ngreat explorers set off.
So it has this sense\nof outwardness.
And yet, it is also\nthe waterfront,
which is so extraordinary\nbecause it is facing due west.
It's cut off from\nthe rest of the city
by railway tracks and\na four-lane highway.
And one of the first\nthings that we did,
the [inaudible] question that we\nasked ourselves when we started
this commission--
and it was, by the way, a direct\ncommission, which is so nice.
It wasn't a competition--
was, how can this building\nspeak of the openness?
How can we use the\ntopography, the geography,
to drive the building?
And more importantly, how can\nwe use the design of a building
to reconcile a city whose\nwaterfront is cut off
from the historic heart?
And you can see in\nthis photograph also
the relationship to the\nold electricity power
station, a very important\npart of Lisbon's
industrial heritage.
But here is this artery that\ntotally bisects the waterfront
from the rest of the city.
But we resolved this by\nmaking a very simple move--
to design a bridge which is\na segment of a curve which
starts on a square, the other\nside of the railway tracks.
And you land on the\nroof of our building.
The bridge is almost\nopen, not quite open.
The building opened\nbefore the bridge.
But this act of connecting\nit not just literally,
but metaphysically back to the\ncity, was a very important move
and began to suggest a way of\ncirculating on the building.
It also creates a really\nsignificant, new, public
outdoor space on the roof.
And we have created additional\npublic outdoor space
by taking the steps\ndown into the water.
And at high tide, they\nflood so that there's
a very kind of\nvisceral relationship
between the geography of\nthe place and the building.
And we had to also find a\nway to integrate an existing
substation which is\nbelow the topography
of our building, which powers\nstill part of the city.
This is the opening.
Like I said, this is not the\nbridge that we have designed,
but this is the bridge on the\nopening weekend of the museum.
There were so many people\nwho came to the opening
that the bridge had to\nbe closed because it
was in danger of collapse.
But I realized that we'd\ndone something right
because we'd captured\nthe public's imagination.
And this is the first\nweekend of opening.
And what you see on the\ntop of the building,
it's not just planting.
That's people.
80,000 people came over two days\nfrom a city whose population
is less than half a million.
So it was a really\nextraordinary kind
of endorsement of taking a\nradical view with a building
but being extremely\nsensitive to its context,
and to see the museum not\njust as a cultural project,
but as an urban one,\nand an urban one
that resolves very complex and\ndifficult issues of access.
And the Electricity\nMuseum next door
is part of the kunsthalle\nor part of the art campus.
We took a decision very early\non to create a building that
was very low-slung in relation\nto the power station partly out
of respect for the muscularity\nof that industrial heritage,
but more importantly, so\nthat the views from the city
would not be impeded\nby the building
and the views from the other\nside of the river looking back
to the city would not be\nimpeded by the building.
So it was, if you\nlike, counterintuitive
to put the galleries\npartially below ground,
but it was that\nmove that allowed
us to use the building as\na piece of urban fabric,
to knit it into the city, and\nto create a sense of presence,
but one that has a\ncertain modesty, perhaps.
The light that you get\nin this part of Lisbon
is quite extraordinary, and\nit bounces off the water.
And we wanted to find a\nway just to capture this
and to amplify the\nextraordinary effects.
So this is the\nroof, which has now
become a real destination\nin its own right in Lisbon.
So it's a place\nyou can hang out.
It's a place from which you\ncan look over to the river,
or you can look\nback to the city.
And really, it's one of the most\npopular destinations in Lisbon
now.
You can go running there.
You can just hang out.
But more importantly, you\nhave, for the first time,
a different perspective of\nthe city because you look--
it's a perspective\nthat people of Lisbon
have not had before,\nwhere you look back
at the city because\nof this aspect
that you get from the roof.
So this is looking\nback across the city.
So this is the kind\nof metaphysical link
and then the physical link\nwith the bridge itself.
And here, you see it in\nrelation to the bridge,
and also in relation\nto the power station.
So there's a very kind\nof soft relationship
between the orthogonal\ngeometry of the power station
and the topography\nof the museum.
And from the roof,\nat sunset, you
have the most fabulous view.
So it's a place that people\njust gather to take photographs.
The presence of the\nbuilding completely changes
according to the sun,\naccording to the time of day,
according to the time of year.
And you can see here how\nwe've taken the steps down
into the water to really\njust heighten its siting
on the edge of the river.
And it's an extraordinary\npart of the river.
You actually can see that moment\nwhere river becomes ocean.
There's literally\na line in the water
that signifies the change.
So we wanted to--
having taken the decision\nto make a low building,
it had a very\nstretched elevation.
So how do we deal with a\nfacade that's extremely long
but break it down\ninto a series of tiles
that have a human scale and that\nreally will catch the light?
So we worked very closely with\na fantastic family business
called Cumella, who are based\njust outside of Barcelona.
We actually looked to work\nwith companies in Portugal,
but they didn't have\nthe technical ability
to mechanically fix the tiles\nin the way that we wanted to.
So we worked with Cumella.
And we're extremely\nlucky when we
find a maker or a manufacturer\nwho is prepared to experiment,
who is prepared to explore\nthe limits of something
in order to advance\nthe debate, perhaps.
And these tiles are a little\nbit three-dimensional so
that sometimes, the\nsun catches the edge.
Sometimes it just\ncatches the front.
And according to the\ngeometry in plan,
the tiles either match up,\nor they begin to offset.
And so you create this kind of\ntextured pattern to the facade.
And it feels very different\naccording to the angle
that you view it from.
And this is the tile.
They're handmade.
And we wanted to choose a\nglaze that was very neutral so
that it would pick\nup the sun, that it
would pick up the changing\nweather conditions
and give a different presence\naccording to the time of day.
And we also wanted\nto add a layer.
So we added this crackle glaze\nbecause a crackle glaze speaks
of history.
And it creates a\ncertain depth so
that when you get\nclose to the building,
there's a depth that you\ncan discover that you
wouldn't otherwise be aware of.
So at different times of day\nwhen the sun is bouncing off
the water, and then this\nis what happens at sunset.
Literally, the whole\nbuilding turns gold.
And the water turns gold.
It is a really wonderful moment.
And because the climate\nis so great there,
you experience it many,\nmany months of the year.
And then as dusk falls,\nit becomes almost a kind
of silvery black.
What we couldn't have imagined\nand was incredibly gratifying
is how people would appropriate\nand use this building.
And here, people are using the\nfacade, because it's so long,
as a musical instrument.
And what we didn't design,\nbut I wish we had--
but now we'll know\nfor next time.
But we discovered it by\nchance after the building
was finished, that if you\nstand at a certain point
below the overhang of the\nroof, the sound of the waves
are amplified in that moment.
And it's a very poetic\nmoment to come across it,
but one of those really nice\nthings that I could have
pretended we designed\nit but we didn't.
But it's there.
What we did design was this.
And knowing how\nstrong the sound was
and how we could use\nthat to advantage--
so the sun hits the\nwater, bounces off
the water onto the underside of\nthe overhang of the cantilever,
and then down through a roof\nlight into the galleries below.
And this is during construction.
But so during the winter months\nwhen the sun is not so strong,
we allow shafts of daylight\nto come through the roof
light, which can also\nbe completely cut off
if a curator doesn't want\nto work with daylight.
Or during the summer months,\nthe geometry of the roof light
is such that it is\nself-shading, and you just
get indirect north light.
At a certain time of\nday in the winter,
you'll be able to see the\nreflection of the water
on the floor of a\npart of the gallery.
And then when you're in the\ngallery itself, you look up,
and you see the sky.
But you also see the edge\nof the overhang above you.
And because this is a\nmuseum of three disciplines,
of art, architecture,\nand technology where
three disciplines coincide,\nwe wanted all these spaces
to flow one from\nanother, for there
to be no barriers, for there\nto be no doors between spaces.
This is as you come in.
It's the big, oval space.
It was really for installations.
And because the power station\nis part of the art campus,
all the exhibitions here are\nsite-specific and are designed
in response to the\nspaces in the building--
so a very technical ceiling,\nand then ramps or steps down
into this oval gallery.
And this was the\nfirst installation
by the artist Dominique\nGonzalez-Foerster to coincide
with the opening, where she\nput a net over the space
so that the visitor becomes\nthe protagonist of the space.
And then smaller spaces\noff that space that
are used for new artists,\nfor exploring technology,
and a room designed specifically\nfor triple video projections,
and a space that is called\nthe Project Room, which
is for up-and-coming\nPortuguese artists.
And it has become a very\nInstagrammable and Instagrammed
moment, but that has certainly\ncontributed to its kind of--
it's in the\ncollective imagination
of the people of Lisbon.
And it's not just the gallery.
It's also become, in the\nyear and a half since it's
been opened, one of the\nmost visited museums
in Portugal, which is really\nquite extraordinary given
that it doesn't even\nhave a collection.
So I used to go to Lisbon\na lot and was always trying
to find nice places\nto eat, quirky places.
And one time, we went and\nfound this place called
Sol e Pesca, which was a tiny,\nformer fishing tackle shop that
only sold tinned fish.
And there was something\nabout this little place that
just caught my imagination.
And when we were back\nin London and we'd
lost a number of competitions,\nand we were really
just down-hearted about losing\ncompetitions-- and you all
know that a competition is a\nhuge and emotional investment,
a huge financial investment.
And we thought, OK, enough,\nenough losing of competition.
Let's invest in ourself.
Let's, why not, open a\ntinned fish restaurant?
So what started off as\nlunch became a project.
So this is a pop-up restaurant\nin Soho that was open for 3
and 1/2 months--
badly-timed, actually,\nbecause it wasn't summer.
It was the winter.
And you can't sit outside\nin London in the winter.
But it became very much an\nexpression of who we are.
We sourced the tins.
The dominant nationalities\nin our office
are Spanish and Portuguese.
And so through\nfamily connections,
we sourced the best sardines,\nthe best anchovies, the best
tuna.
And we turned the humble tin\ninto an object of desire.
And with our obsession\nwith the V&A and vitrines,
the window of the restaurant\nbecame the vitrine
for these beautiful tins.
And in fact, there is\na place I went to--
I've been to twice since\nI've been here in Boston
called Saltie Girl, which\nhas some of the tins
that we sold in Tincan.
And so the shop\nwindow is the vitrine.
And then we did everything.
We did the furniture.
We ran the restaurant.
We kind of got a taste for being\na little bit entrepreneurial.
And we designed this light\nto showcase the OLED film
technology, very thin\nfilm, and persuaded OLED
to give us the film for free.
And then we assembled\nthe lights ourselves
in the office with\na view to turning it
into a business, which, of\ncourse, hasn't happened.
But we got the taste for a kind\nof self-generating project.
And I do think that--
I don't know what the\nsystem is in America as much
as in Europe, but I feel that\narchitecture, as a profession,
we're becoming\nquite marginalized.
And the competition\nsystem is getting
a little bit out of hand.
So much is asked of so many\npeople for so little money.
It is not sustainable,\nand it's not right.
And so the more that we can\ngenerate our own projects
and get back in control--
and there's so much opportunity.
And there is so much\nmoney to do things.
So to be\nentrepreneurial, this is
a project called Pitch/Pitch.
We have quite a sporty office.
And the team liked to\nplay five-a-side football
after work, but it\nwas really difficult
finding a pitch\nthat was available.
And so we thought,\nOK, then we'll
design a system\nusing carbon fiber
of removable, stackable,\nfive-a-side football pitches
that can be put on sites\nthat are vacant temporarily
and that will meet\nan unmet need.
And we've presented it\nat various conferences,
and it's had a lot of traction.
And we're now putting\ntogether a business case
to see if we can't just\ngenerate our own projects.
So it can go in any\ngritty, urban site,
or it could even go on\nthe roof of a high rise.
And we're working with\nARUP, the engineers.
And this has really been\nstress tested to a high degree.
So we're confident\nthat the business
plan will come to something.
Talking of carbon fiber,\nthis is a project, MPavilion.
It's in Melbourne.
It's Melbourne's answer to\nthe Serpentine commission.
And the site is a\nreally beautiful park
in Melbourne, Victoria Gardens.
And it felt to me\nthat to do a pavilion,
it's not like doing a building.
There's an opportunity to take\na different kind of slant on it.
And we wanted to\ntry and recreate
a tree canopy and the\npoetics of a tree canopy
that you would let some light\nin and dappled sunlight,
and that it could\nalso move in the wind.
And that is-- you don't have\nthat liberty of something
moving in the wind\nin a building.
But with a pavilion, you do.
So we thought we\nwould explore it
and designed a system\nof a series of petals
that we imagined would be in\nresin with carbon fiber that
were supported on very slender,\n4-meter high carbon fiber
tubes, but all\ninterlinked together.
We had a hunch how to do it.
This was the render that we did\nand presented to the client.
But we didn't know\nexactly how to do it,
and we didn't know who we\nwere going to work with.
And Australia is a\nvery long way away.
But on one of my first visits\nthere to develop the project,
we were introduced by ARUP\nto a company called mouldCAM,
who started off in the\nnautical engineering business
and were moving into using\ncomposites in building.
And we were so\nfortunate because they
were a partner who were\nprepared to explore
this idea of creating ultra\nslender petals with up
to five-meter span.
So with them, we started\nto, through trial and error,
figure out how to create\nthese petals because we wanted
the resin to have a\ntranslucency so that you'd
get this beautiful\nlight under it
and for the strength to come\nfrom carbon fiber strands that
would be part of the\npattern of the canopy.
These partners we worked\nwith were so extraordinary.
I mean, this looks quite kind\nof Heath Robinson, and it was.
But this was to build\na very simple jig
to wind the carbon fiber\nstrands and then figure out
the right degree of set\nof this translucent resin.
And that was the\nreally tricky bit.
What they discovered\nwas if you let
the resin set too much\nbefore you put the carbon
fiber strands, they would\njust float to the top
and have no structural\nperformance.
If you put them in\nwhen it was too wet,
the whole thing would\nbe completely floppy.
And the only way\nthey could do it
was to work double shifts,\nfrom 7:00 in the morning
until 9:00 at\nnight, to make sure
that the carbon fiber strands\ngo in at the exact right moment.
So the commitment from this\ncompany was really phenomenal.
And that is-- but we're very\ndemanding of our partners,
but we're very giving as well.
And we received incredible\ncommitment from them.
So you can see, these\ncarbon fiber rods
are actually developed\nfor camera tripods,
came from Finland.
The resin, the\ntranslucent resin,
came from France used\nin the surfing industry.
And you can see here, the\ncarbon fiber spans, which
connect each of the\npetals together,
the ribs, and then\nthe strands, which
give the petals the strength.
And so you really do get this\nkind of quite dreamy quality
of a tree canopy, and beautiful\nshadows and reflections
on the ground.
And then at night, it became\na little bit more blingy.
And the lighting was within\nthe cables of the columns.
And the petals themselves,\nworked as amplifiers.
So it was a really great\nspace for performances,
and it was hugely atmospheric.
Some projects really are\nkind of created and sculpted
with atmosphere rather\nthan through form,
and this is one of them.
This is a competition\nwhich we lost--
so I don't understand\nwhy we lost, but we did--
for a mosque in Dubai,\nwhere the mosque--
and it's in the shadow\nof the World Trade
Center designed by Foster.
And we wanted the whole\nkind of conceptual thinking
to express this journey from\nthe everyday to the spiritual.
So it starts as a\npark, and the park then
becomes the roof of the mosque.
And really, the atmosphere is\nthrough the extraordinary light
effects that you would get\nthrough this aluminium,
self-shading structure,\nbut that is calculated
to allow light in where you\nwant in this great moment
at the end.
On a very different scale, this\nis the building in Bangkok,
which opened last year.
The shopping mall\nhad opened before,
but the hotel only\nopened last year.
So it's on the site\nof what used to be
or was the gardens of\nthe British embassy.
It was the most expensive\npiece of real estate
to change hands--
seven-story shopping mall\nwith a luxury multiplex
cinema, and then\na 35-story hotel,
which is run by Park Hyatt.
And we'd never worked\nin Asia before.
And I was really keen\nthat we would try and find
a way that the building\nwould speak of its place
and that it was something that\njust couldn't be done anywhere.
The topology of the building\nhas this very typical plinth
and tower.
And we were very restricted\nby how high we could
go with the tower and where\nwe could do the tower,
and restricted by the\nheight of the plinth.
And so it became, how can we\nuse the form of the building
to integrate the\ntower with the plinth?
And how could we\nuse the cladding--
and the cladding on a shopping\nmall is largely opaque.
How could we use that--
and it's a developer's budget--
but to somehow reflect\nthe chaos of the city
and reflect the\ncity back to itself.
And Bangkok is chaotic\nthe entire time,
but in a really beguiling way.
And so we designed a very simple\nsystem of aluminum shingles.
There were four\ndifferent tile types.
And it's literally just\na folded aluminum plate,
incredibly low-tech\nbecause in Asia,
the socioeconomic condition is\nthe exact opposite of the US
and Europe.
So labor is extremely cheap, and\ntechnology is very expensive.
So how can we kind of play\nto that as a strength?
We would never be able to afford\nto do this in the US or Europe
because the hundreds\nof thousands
of tiles and the labor\nneeded to fix them.
But it meant that we\ndidn't have to use
a cheap, standard\ncladding system.
And it meant that we could\ncreate a kind of moir  effect
on this very massive facade.
And then having done this, the\nexpectation, the kind of drama,
has to play out inside as well.
And there are some great\nmoments when you're looking up
through the atrium of the mall.
From the biggest\nproject we've ever
done to the smallest\nproject we've ever done,
this is the ceramic table.
And this project again came out\nof our obsession with ceramics.
We were working on\nthe V&A and the museum
in Lisbon at the same\ntime, both using ceramics.
And I wanted to\nexplore how could we
design a sort of small, modest,\nubiquitous piece of furniture,
but, through its\nmateriality, change it
into something completely other.
And could we design and\nmake a table in ceramic?
Well, of course, our first\nexplorations into this
were just--
I mean, they were\nreally quite amusing.
In the kiln, the legs\nwould totally buckle,
and it took us a long time to\nrealize that we couldn't just
use a typical ceramic.
We would have to look\nat high-tech ceramics.
So we looked to\ndifferent industries.
And there's\n[inaudible],, a company
who used ceramics\nin the aerospace
and the medical industry.
And we used a material,\nsilicon carbide,
which is an incredibly dense,\nstrong ceramic, but wanted,
then, out of\ncomplete perversity,
to change this table\ninto something other,
to apply a glaze that\nspoke of history.
And the crackle\nglaze was developed.
It was the result of an\naccident in the kiln in the Song
dynasty.
And when they\ndiscovered it, they
realized it was a\nthing of such beauty
that they worked out\nhow to replicate that.
And so how could we apply a\nkind of artisanal crackle glaze
to a very high-tech ceramic?
And what is extraordinary,\nwhat happened
when we did that--\nand first of all,
the glaze would just\nkind of slip off.
It took a lot of\nexperimentation and work
with our partners to figure\nout a way of doing it.
But somehow, the\ncrackle glaze speaks
of the kind of fractal,\nmolecular makeup of this silica
carbide.
And it was a real\nmoment of revelation.
Now, the only problem was that\nwe went through six prototypes
because after the\ntable had been fired,
and nobody had glued\nthis silica carbide
and then fired it again before\nwe got to the perfect table.
But then it had to be glazed,\nand it was taken somewhere else
to be glazed, near [inaudible].
And while the final\ntable that was
going to be the subject of an\nexhibition was in the kiln,
there was an\naccident in the kiln
where the plate above\nthe table just failed.
The connections failed,\nand it fell on the table
and smashed it into\na thousand pieces.
So the table that\nnever happened,
but it was a piece\nof research where we
were following our own illogic.
And one day, when\nwe have the energy,
we're going to pick it up, and\nwe're going to make it happen.
And the final project\nthat I'll talk about
is the project for the\nVictoria and Albert Museum
in London, which opened\nin summer of last year.
This is our site.
It's between, on the\nright-hand side, the Henry Cole
wing, the first\nbuilding of the V&A,
on the left, the Aston Webb.
It's on Exhibition Road.
It's a lost site that had never\nbeen used by the museum before.
And the V&A is part of\na much bigger vision
by Prince Albert--
Albertopolis-- to\nhave, if you like,
a campus of three museums.
So there was the V&A,\nthe Science Museum,
and the Natural History Museum.
And we wanted to\nfind a way, how could
that sort of idea of a campus\nthat the three museums was
to bring culture and art\nto the people-- that was
the vision of Prince Albert?
Was there something there\nthat would inform what we did?
This is the photograph\ntaken in 1863
of Henry Cole, who was\nthe founder, if you like,
of the V&A, and his\narchitectural and engineering
team standing in front\nof the Henry Cole wing.
And more than 150 years later,\nstanding in the same place,
is my team and our\nengineers from ARA.
So we've moved.
We've moved on.
It's worth putting this\nproject into a little bit
more recent context.
So this is-- you may\nremember Libeskind's scheme
for the exact same site.
He won the competition in '97,\nbut it was abandoned in 2004.
And remarkably, during that\ntime, it got planning consent.
But for one reason or\nanother, it never happened.
And obviously, I'm\ndelighted because otherwise,
we'd never had had the job.
But for me, this\nbuilding marked a moment,
and the demise of this\nbuilding marked a moment.
And it was the end of\nthe building as icon.
And so when we were invited\nto do the competition,
we took a completely\npolar position.
And I wanted to speak about\nthe iconography of place
rather than the\nbuilding as icon,
that in the intervening\nyears, the V&A had restated
their brief and decided that\nwhat they actually needed
was a vast gallery\nspace below ground.
But we took this to\nits absolute limit,
but saw it as an\nopportunity to really
reimage the relationship\nbetween the city and the museum,
between the street\nand the museum,
because I believe very strongly\nthat the role of the museum
in the 21st century is to\nengage in contemporary life
and to go beyond the\nconfines of its buildings.
So we took a very\nradical and rather daring
position when we did\nthe competition, which
was to suggest that we open up\nthe Aston Webb screen, which
previously was completely solid.
So in the context,\nthis is the street
that goes from South\nKensington to Hyde
Park, the Natural History\nMuseum, the Science
Museum, and the V&A.\nSo you see, here,
the vision that it was a\ncampus of three museums,
but each one felt\nextremely isolated.
So our first move was to take\nthe street into the museum
and take the museum\nout onto the street.
But to do that, we had\nto negotiate a big level
difference of two meters\nbetween Exhibition Road
and the entrance, the\nground level of the V&A.
So we created an area\nof high courtyard
that then just bleeds into\nan area of low courtyard.
And this was about\nwanting to maximize
the outdoor public\nspace, to maximize
the amount of courtyard so\nthat the courtyard could become
appropriated by the public for\nany number of installations,
for a place just to hang\nout, or for parties.
And this was our\ncompetition render,
where you can see that we had\ntaken this very brave move
to challenge the opacity of\nthis Grade I-listed screen.
And Grade I listing is the\nhighest level of protection
that you can get for a historic\nbuilding, and rightly so.
But I think because there\nis only one thing in life
that you can't design,\nand that is heritage.
And so we have a\nduty to be incredibly
respectful and sensitive\nto our heritage,
but we also have\na responsibility
to breathe new\nlife into buildings
and to make radical\npropositions.
And if we can do the same,\nto do both at the same time,
then I think we can\nbegin to move forward.
So when we first went to--
this was the screen before.
When we had won the\ncompetition, and we
went to English Heritage\nand the planning authorities
and presented our scheme,\nthey simply said no.
And well, they would\ndo, wouldn't they?
Because the presumption with\nGrade I-listed buildings is you
do not touch them.
You just don't mess with them.
So we went away.
We did not change what\nwe designed at all,
but what we changed was the\nway that we argued the case.
So we did a huge\namount of research,
and we had seconded two\nresearchers from the V&A.
And we argued that this\nscreen was originally
designed to hide, and now the\nsocial imperative is really--
it's the opposite.
We must reveal these fabulous\nelevations of the museum
to the public.
But it was a very\ndifficult argument to make.
And then we found this drawing.
And this drawing is the\noriginal competition drawing
that Aston Webb did\nfor the V&A. And what
it shows is that screen was--
although it was still\nsolid at the bottom,
it was much more open.
And there was a\ngarden behind it.
And once we'd\nfound that drawing,
we knew we had the argument,\nbecause what had happened
was after Aston Webb\nhad won the competition
and during the construction\nphase, same old--
they've run out of money.
And the boiler rooms, which were\nintended to be below ground,
they could no longer afford\nto have them below ground.
So they had to move\nthem above ground.
And he redesigned the\nscreen at the last minute
to conceal the boiler rooms.
So we had our argument.
It was originally designed\nto conceal the boiler rooms.
The boiler rooms\nhave long since gone.
Now we can go back to\nhis original vision.
So nine months later, we got it.
And it has had a very\nradical effect on the way
that people enter the museum.
The main entrance\nis in Cromwell Road,
which is a quite busy highway.
And there's a very grand\nentrance, and it's wonderful.
But you go up a\ngrand set of steps.
And it's a little bit overawing\nIt can feel intimidating,
whereas this is a\ntotally different way.
You just drift in\noff the street.
You don't have to\ngo to the museum.
You can hang out in the\ncafe that we've put there.
You can just hang\nout in the courtyard,
or you can go into the museum.
But to create that courtyard,\nwhich looks now very
effortless, was an\nunbelievably challenging
structural operation\nbecause we had, in effect,
three historic\nelevations where we
dug a very deep basement of 15\nmeters that wanted naturally
to fall in.
So they had to be\nliterally propped up
with these massive props.
And we also had to\nunderpin a wing of the V&A
while the museum remained\nopen to the public
and while its very precious\ncollection remained in place.
And we had piling rigs within\none foot of historic stone
cornices.
We had to pile down 50\nmeters with tension piles.
Because when you dig\na very deep basement,
you normally put\na superstructure
on top, a multi-story building\nor a high-rise building.
But all we had was a courtyard.
And so the grounds\njust wants to lift.
Because all the earth\nhas been taken away,
the slab wants to lift.
And Cambridge University,\nwho work closely with ARUP,
came to the site and was so\ntaken with the structural drama
that they have installed\nfiber optic monitoring
cables in the tension piles\nand the [? rough ?] slab
because they believe that the\nmovements that will be recorded
over a number of\nyears may disprove
the elastic theory, which is the\ntheory on which engineers make
these calculations.
And if that is the case, we\nwill have advanced knowledge
in a way that we simply couldn't\nhave imagined at the beginning.
And it's a huge\ncredit to the V&A
that they allowed\nus to, in effect,
use this project as a case\nstudy, which will be published
when the data is complete.
So we have the cafe which\nwe put in the area of sun.
The one kind of--
there was a paradox that\ndrove our thinking of this.
And this is that the big\nevent, the really great moment,
is the gallery below ground,\nbut you can't see it.
So this idea of how do we\nmake visible the invisible
became a driving\nforce in the way
that we design, both at the kind\nof macro and the micro levels.
So we wanted the\ncourtyard somehow
to speak of what was below.
And the V&A is a very\ndidactic institution.
Its buildings are didactic.
Its mission is didactic.
And its collection is didactic.
Could we take that, that idea?
Could we literally\nreflect it through design
and, in doing so,\nreveal to people why
things are like they are?
And for me, narrative\nin architecture
is really important.
And it's important\nbecause it helps
us to make sense of things.
It helps us to understand.
So this is an oculus\nthat we designed
that allows dramatic\nshafts of daylight
into the gallery below if\nthe curators want to use it.
And the curators are\nincredibly conventional
and generally don't, but\nhoping that they will open
their eyes to the potential.
But this oculus\ndoes more than that.
It also reveals\nthe very structure
that supports the courtyard that\nis the gallery ceiling below.
And the structure of the\ngallery ceiling in itself
is a huge piece of engineering\nbecause it spans 38 meters,
and it's a folded steel plate.
And so what you're seeing here\nis that steel plate revealed.
We've conceptualized it as\nthough it's an empty museum
vitrine.
We painted the inside of\nthe lining of the plate
red in a kind of reference to\nold-fashioned museum vitrines
that used to have red velvet.
And you see down into the void\nof the gallery space below.
And then on the inside\nof the balustrade that
is highly polished, it reflects\nthe structure back to you.
So you have this very\nkind of visceral reading
of what is below.
And because of the\ncomplexity and the evolution
and the way that the V&A has\ndeveloped over centuries,
we wanted to kind of reference\nthat as much as possible.
What you see here is\nthe redundant lift
overrun from the\nLibeskind scheme, which
was put in before the\nproject was abandoned.
And it'll always be there.
We thought, wouldn't it be\nnice to kind of reflect it
so that somehow,\nthis building speaks
of a very complex and\nrich evolution of design?
This is one of the drawings.
I can't tell you how technically\ncomplex this project was
as a piece of engineering,\nas a piece of coordination,
as a piece of reconciling\nhistoric fabric
with new technology, but\nit was extremely difficult.
But here we want to make\nit look as easy and as
effortless as possible.
So by creating three new\nentrance doors into the museum,
we've cut through the stonework,\nthrough the fenestration.
And by doing that, you reveal\nthis really beautiful profile
that you weren't really\nable to understand before.
And it is a kind of classic\ncase of through subtraction,
you reveal more.
This, you're now entering\ninto the new entrance
hall in the existing museum.
So we opened up the windows.
We let the light in.
There's a completely different--
there's no big,\ncentral entrance desk.
There are the interactive\nscreens at the back.
And V&A staff greet you\nand ask how they can
help you enjoy your journey.
So it's this sort of idea\nof informality, which
starts in the courtyard, is\nthen played out in the entrance
itself.
And there's a very\nnice detail here.
If you can see, there's\na great tradition
in the V&A of marble floors.
And we had do-- oops, sorry.
We had to take up the mosaic\nin order to do the project.
And so we kept all the mosaics.
We washed them,\ncleaned them, and have
used them to repair other\ngallery floors in the museum.
But then we then had made new\nmosaics in the same colors
and at the same size, which\nwe have relayed as a border
because these borders\nare very traditional.
But the border is a reflection\nof the tiles in the courtyard
that I'll speak about\nin a bit, which,
in turn, are a reflection of\nthe geometry of the structure.
And what was a very funny\nparallel, coincidental
parallel, the mosaic\nfloors of the museum
were allegedly installed\nby female prisoners
in Holloway Prison.
And the group-- there\nwas a cooperative
that was formed just for\nthis project in Italy,
an all-female group.
There was a filmmaker.
There was a graphic\ndesigner, who
laid these mosaics\nonto mats before they
came to be installed in London.
So they're not in\nprison, but it was just--
I thought the female\nthing was quite nice.
And we did something else\nthat was very radical.
And again, none of the other\ncompetitors had done that.
We proposed that the stair\ndown in the new gallery below
would happen within the museum.
Now, it was much easier and it\nwould have been much cheaper
to have put that stair down\ninto the gallery directly
from the courtyard, but we\ndidn't do that for two reasons.
One, this project was\nall about maximizing
the amount of\nfreespan gallery space
below because that's\nwhat the V&A need,
and maximizing the amount\nof courtyard space above.
And of we put the\nstair in the courtyard,
the whole courtyard\nwould be filled
with a kind of paraphernalia of\nentrance halls and cloakrooms.
But there was another reason,\nthat we didn't want this
to be seen as an extension.
We wanted there to be an\ninextricable relationship
between history and modernity.
And by putting the stair\nin the existing museum,
I think we create that.
But to do that was far\nfrom straightforward,
and we literally had to\nsupport the weight of history
and underpin while the museum\nwas still in operation.
These new beams and\ncolumns, originally, we
had designed them to be white.
But when I came to the\nsite and I was just so
struck by the\nenormity of the task
that they were doing,\nthat they were holding
the weight of history, that\nit was very clear to me
that we had to paint\nthem in a color that
spoke of that kind of\nstructural prowess and drama.
And so we have painted them\nin International Orange.
And International Orange\nhas a great provenance.
It was the color that first\naircraft were painted in so
that they would be\nseen against the sky.
It's the color of the bridge,\nthe San Francisco bridge.
It's a color that has meaning.
And you understand here, I\nthink, this inextricable link
and the kind of conversation\nbetween history and modernity.
And we're able to-- because\nthis space is so vast,
we've let in light.
And it just animates\nthe experience
because going down below ground\ncan be very disorientating.
But if you always frame views\nof where you've come from,
and if you play and\nmanipulate daylight,
your descent feels\nextremely comfortable.
And we have two stairs, one\nto go down and one to go up.
And the reason\nfor that is partly
the kind of drama of\nkind of passing ships.
But it's also so that you\nexit through the shop,
but you do not enter\nthrough the shop.
My big critique of the\nV&A is that to come in
through the main entrance, you\nhave to go through the shop.
And it's always\nfelt a little bit--
I'm a purist.
I think your shop is the\nreward, the end of your journey,
not the beginning.
And then the daylight\nwe play with so
that there's this moment.
When you get to the\nbottom of the stairs,
there's actually more daylight\nthan when you came in.
So there's this kind\nof magic moment,
and you're drawn down into\nthe underworld by the light.
And this is the folded\nplate that spans 38 meters.
And it's an extremely\ntechnical ceiling
that's doing a huge amount.
And this is the kind of\nlight that you can get.
And depending on the time of\nyear, it can be very diffuse,
or it can be used\ndramatically to highlight
a certain sculpture.
So we've calculated\nexactly where the light
falls at every day in the year.
And really, this kind of very\ntechnical scene from which you
can suspend a car, which has all\nthe AC, the lighting, the AV,
it comes from very heroic\ntradition of steel and iron
galleries at the V&A. And in\nfact, the gallery spaces that
were used for their headlining\nshows, which have now
moved to a new gallery, are\nthese two galleries that
have had, for years and\ndecades, suspended ceilings.
So their next project is\ngoing to be to reveal these.
So by doing our project, they\nthen get to more projects.
So it was a really clever piece\nof master planning from the V&A
to have a very strategic\nvision for the museum.
And then you've\nbeen to the show.
You've seen what\nyou came to see,
and you're drawn\nup by the light.
And as you go up,\nthe views open up.
And this sgraffito wall, which\nwas done by art students--
because the Henry Cole building\nwas the original Royal College
of Art Building--
had never been seen\nby the public before,
and it's been nearly cleaned.
And we wanted to frame it\nand reveal it as a moment.
And also, through the\nefficiency of the folded plate,
we created a mezzanine level\nin the void of the structure.
And that is where we put the\ntoilets and the cloakroom.
So all of that kind\nof paraphernalia
is put within the void of a\nhighly efficient structure.
So on a rather gloomy day,\nbut this is the sgraffito wall
that you see.
And then to come back into the\ncourtyard, this idea of making
visible the invisible,\nhow can the character
of the surface of\nthe courtyard, how
can that speak of its place?
How can we invest it with\na character that could only
come from its position in V&A?
And we wanted the\ncourtyard to read
not as a series of\northogonal tiles,
but to read as a\nkind of color field
where the lines between\nthe tiles become blurred.
So we took the three-dimensional\ngeometry of the structure,
and we extracted from\nit-- we flattened it,
and we extracted from it\na two-dimensional pattern
that we then\nrationalized that would
become the setting-out\npattern for the tiles.
And this is actually\nthe setting-out drawing
for the people who\nhad to lay the tiles.
So it feels like it was\na difficult thing to do.
But again, we had\nfantastic craftsmen
who were working on it.
But the tile, there's a story\nbehind the tiles themselves.
And the V&A has one of the most\nimportant ceramic collections
in the world.
And I became very\nobsessed with ceramics
and got taken around\nthe ceramics collection
by the keeper of ceramics,\nwho knows more about ceramics
than anyone else in the world.
And it was an extremely kind of\nhumbling and privileged moment.
Anyway, how could we use that?
We have to use that access\nto knowledge somehow
to invest in the courtyard.
And these really\nbeautiful Chinese glazes
where the pigment pools\nwhere you have depth,
could we find a way\nof capturing that?
So we embarked on\nwhat we thought
was going to be a\nsix-month piece of research
but turned into 2 and\n1/2 years research.
I just want to make it clear\nthat the building was not
delayed 2 and 1/2 years because\nthe research took longer.
We had the latitude in the way\nthat the program was phased.
But there was a moment\nwhere the V&A wanted
to know what plan\nB was and could
we design plan B if this\nidea of the ceramic courtyard
wouldn't work.
And I said, no, we're\nnot going to do.
We're taking on a massive amount\nof work at our own expense
to do this.
But if it doesn't work,\nwe'll just have granite sets
and be done with it.
But we had to believe\nthat we had the tenacity
and that we would find the\nright partners to work with.
And we did.
We found a company\nin the Netherlands
called Tichelaar, who\nare actually the oldest
company in the Netherlands.
And they are again\na family business.
And with family\nbusinesses, there's
a different relationship\nwith your work.
It's a much more\nemotional relationship.
And you need that kind\nof emotional connection
to persuade people to\nembark on a journey
that you don't quite\nknow where it's leading.
And Tichelaar, we\nchose them in the end
because they use porcelain.
They use porcelain on facades\nas a kind of [inaudible]..
But I've never used it\nin a public courtyard.
And in fact, porcelain hasn't\nbeen used in public spaces
before.
It was used in the Victorian\ntimes as kind of porches,
but they're extremely slippery\nand just at a domestic scale.
So you couldn't\npossibly do that.
But there's something about\nthe base color of porcelain
which is so much\nmore beautiful and
nuanced than a typical ceramic.
It's got this kind of\nwhitish, grayish blue,
whereas a typical ceramic\nis more biscuit-y.
And these are tiles,\nsix tile types,
all made by hand so that\neach one is slightly
a different size.
And they're not\nrectified afterwards.
They are parallelograms\nin shape because that's
the pattern that was extracted\nfrom the three-dimensional
structure.
And by having\nparallelograms, you
begin to lose the sense\nof orthogonal joints.
And we further\ncomplicated that visually
by putting a diagonal\nthrough the tiles
and then having grooves in\nthe tiles because we wanted
to also introduce\ncolor and for the color
to be glossy like that\nbeautiful Chinese glaze.
But of course,\nglossy is slippery.
So by having a thin groove\nand putting the glaze--
all of the glaze was done by\nhand with a kind of pipette.
Your foot doesn't\never touch the glaze.
So through a lot of testing--
and we had to go through an\nextremely rigorous process
of getting this certified\nbecause it had not
been used before--
we came up with these tiles.
And so you can see how white\nthe base clay and the kind
of subtlety of the blue glaze.
We then thought, having achieved\nthat, well, we just push it
one little bit further.
And we would use porcelain\ntiles to clad the cafe roof.
And we thought, well,\nthey're smaller.
They're more straightforward,\nand we'll extrude them.
So the die was made.
And there's a reason you\ndon't extrude porcelain,
and it's because\nit doesn't work.
So we pushed it as far as we\ncould and then had to retreat.
And the cafe roof tiles are also\nmade in the same slipcasting.
It would have just been\na lot cheaper and faster
to extrude them,\nbut maybe next time.
And then we had a different--\nbecause you're not
walking on the tiles on\nthe cafe roof, obviously,
we wanted to play with\nthe subtlety of the glaze
and with a kind of\nreflection on the glaze.
But the glaze was so subtle\nand the color was so subtle
that the people who\nwere glazing them
kept forgetting whether they'd\nput the glaze on before they
put them in the kiln.
So they had to spray them\nwith this copper oxide
to remind themselves that\nthey had been glazed,
and the copper oxide just\nburns off in the fire.
But there's something about\nthe alchemy of ceramics
and the process in the kiln\nthat I enjoyed about that.
And I don't know if you can\nsee here, but in the sunlight,
you really see the\nsubtlety of this glaze.
So there's porcelain\ntiles there,
and all this porcelain,\nand this is white concrete.
Just coming back to the\ngates and that screen
that we opened up\nand altered, it
was full of emotional resonance\nbecause it has shrapnel damage
from World War II.
And when we were trying--
having got the permission\nto open up the screen,
we were then faced\nwith a kind of paradox
of having to close it at night.
Because although\nit's a public space,
it belongs to V&A. The\ncollection's priceless.
It has to be secured at night.
And it was the piece\nof design that took us
almost the longest because\nit was so hard to come up
with a solution\nthat somehow spoke
of the gravitas of\na museum gate, also
that would allow you to\nstill see through them.
We looked at glass gates that\nwould go into the pavement.
We looked at conventional gates.
Nothing seemed to work.
We commissioned a survey\ndrawing because we had to label
and number each of the stones.
We had to remove the entire\nscreen in order to do the work
and then put it back\nin its altered form.
And the stones that\nweren't being put back
were stored for posterity.
But when the drawing came\nback from the surveyors,
they had mapped the imprint\nof the shrapnel damage.
And at that point, we knew\nhow to resolve this problem.
So we designed the gates to be\n35-mil thick, solid aluminum,
anodized aluminum, that\nare then perforated.
And we designed a\npiece of software
that would calculate the\ndifferent angles of perforation
so that from certain\nvantage points,
you would be able to see the\nimprint of the shrapnel damage
in the exact place, the\nstone that had been removed.
And in that way, we're not just\nmaking the invisible visible;
we're memorializing absence.
And you can still\nsee through it.
And as you pass along it, it\nfeels something incredibly
modern and dynamic, but it has\nthis kind of reference back.
And you can see here that\nwhen the gates are open,
you understand where\nthat shrapnel damage was
because the base of\nthe columns is new
because the structure\nof the columns
is now completely\ndifferent, having taken away
the base of the stone plinth.
And then there's a\nvery nice detail.
After the bombing, there\nwas this inscription
that talks about the\nenduring values of the V&A
despite the blitz.
And we are now--
we've got a new inscription\nthat speaks about the reference
to the shrapnel\ndamage and how that
can be read in the new gates.
And then finally,\nwe weren't asked
to incorporate the royal crest.
It wasn't part of our brief.
But I was very\nstruck by something
that the then director of the\nV&A, Mark Jones, said to me.
He said, no, you don't\nhave to, but I just
think it's important\nthat we remind
people of why this museum--
and particularly politicians,\nwhy this museum is here.
And it was something\nthat stayed with me.
And I said, no, he's right.
But this is a particularly ugly\nrendition of the royal crest,
so could we breathe new\nlife into the royal crest
and to make it more relevant.
And so we have picked\nout the royal crest.
We've made it even\nbigger, and this time,
in perforations that are\njust perpendicular because we
didn't have to play with the\ndepth of the shrapnel damage.
So you can see\nthrough those gates,
but you can read, very\nclearly, the royal crest.
And this is to say goodnight.
Thank you.
[applause]
Thank you so much, Amanda.
We're going to take\nquestions from the audience.
But while we're\npreparing the questions,
I might start with one.
OK.
I think what was really\ncompelling about the work
that you showed tonight,\nwhich is not something
I would have thought about,\nis the way in which you
use bare minimum architectural\nelements in the two
main projects.
So roof steps and an oculus\nin the case of Lisbon,
and-- or the flip, so ground\nsurface steps and an oculus
in the case of the V&A.
And I think this is really\ncounter to the way in which
maybe riverfronts\nare being populated
or public spaces are being\ndone, I think, in America.
Or this might be\na generalization,
which is about packing of\nprograms in kiosks and events
and public architecture.
So can you speak to\nanything of this kind
of bare minimum which--
Well, I think there are two\nways, really, to answer that.
One is about materiality.
And I think there's\noften, in architecture,
a proliferation of\ntoo many materials,
too much discord, too many\nthings coming together,
and that the more\nreductive you can be,
the more coherent a piece of\narchitecture you can create.
But at the same\ntime, it's really
important to add depth and\nrichness and narratives.
So you have to choose\nyour materials well
that you can really mine\nthem for what is there.
But the other side\nof your question,
which has to do with urban\nspaces and riverfronts
and public spaces, I\nreally feel strongly
that we should not\noverdesign them,
that you have to let\nwhat will happen happen,
and that you have to\nsee and understand
how people are going\nto use the space
and appropriate the space.
Both in the riverfront and\nthe courtyard at the V&A,
we could have massively\noverdesigned it.
We could have done\nall the benches, and--
but we deliberately pulled back.
And that's what makes it\nfeel a very informal space,
because there is\nvery little there.
And so you invest it with\nyour own interpretation,
if you like.
[inaudible]
You seem to use surface texture\nas a very important element
in your work.
What does the\ntexture of surfaces
mean to you in terms of the\narchitectural expression?
Well, it's a way of--
I think surface and texture is\na way of playing out narrative.
So in the case of the\ncourtyard at the V&A,
it's this idea that the\npattern of the tiles--
and it comes from something.
It comes from the\nthree-dimensional structure.
It's an attempt to add a\nlayer of narrative which
will give you this kind\nof intuitive understanding
of a kind of palpable\nsense of what is below you.
So it's to kind of elaborate a\nstory, elaborate a narrative.
And then in the case of\nLisbon and why do we apply
crackle glaze, why do\nwe go to that extreme--
why not just a\nplain, white tile?
Well, in order to\nget to that tile,
we had looked at maybe\n50 different glazes,
different textures.
And there comes a moment\nwhere it just feels right.
And sometimes, there is no point\nin trying to overexplain it.
You just kind of\nhave that intuition
that that is the color,\nthat is the surface, that
is the texture that is going\nto allow you to use the surface
to amplify the light\nand to really root
this building in its geography.
How do you compare\nthe [inaudible]??
Excuse me?
How do you compare the\nporcelain with marble?
How do I compare the?
Compare the porcelain\nwith marble.
Oh, how do--
What do you--
Well, first of all,\nwe wouldn't have
been able to afford marble.
And porcelain--\nmarble isn't really
part of the history of the\nV&A. The thing about the V&A
is not only does it have a\nfantastic ceramic collection,
but it also has ceramics\nembedded in the building
itself.
And that's part of the\nbuilding as a didactic piece.
And so for me, it spoke\nvery much of its place.
It's not because I don't love\nmarble, and I do love marble.
But for the next project maybe.
But porcelain is--\nalthough we associate it
with kind of things of great\ndelicacy and chinaware,
it's actually an extremely\nhard, strong material.
It's completely vitreous,\nso it doesn't absorb water.
And it's harder than\ngranite, and it's
harder than [inaudible] stone.
So our associations with it\nare something of delicacy.
But actually, it's\nextremely robust.
Thank you so much for showing\nsome incredibly beautiful work.
And it strikes me that it\nhas a kind of refinement
to it that very few other\npractices are able to achieve.
In its refinement\nin service of what
I would call a kind of\nremarkable entrepreneurial
spirit--
so even in the way that you're\ndescribing the work to us,
it's as though these\nbuildings are instruments
that are doing real\nwork that the city can
concede that you're\nsort of giving them
something in exchange.
And I'm wondering if--
this is entirely a kind\nof open-ended prompt.
But I'm wondering if you might\ntalk to us a little bit more
about architect as\nentrepreneur and architect
as sort of self-initiator, and\nmaybe the kind of relationship
that that might have to the\nsorts of forms that you're
designing and the search for a\nvery high degree of refinement.
Well, first for all, thank\nyou for describing our work
in such beautiful terms.
It's really, really nice.
I suppose what we're doing\nwith materials is trying to--
for me as an architect,\nwhat really drives
me is to advance the\ndebate a tiny bit,
just a little, tiny\nbit in every project,
to move something forward.
You don't always succeed,\nbut to attempt that.
And I think it's our\nresponsibility as architects
to do that, to make progress.
So if you accept that\nposition, then you
have to take on a\ncertain challenge.
You have to form relationships\nwith consultants,
with makers who are going to\ngo on that journey with you,
because it's very difficult.
It was even very difficult\nwith the V&A to say, trust me.
It's going to be fine.
I'm an architect.
We can do this\nporcelain courtyard.
It's never been done before.
It's not easy, and it took--
so you have to collectively\nhave a huge sort of self-belief
that you can answer the\nquestions that you don't yet
know that exist.
So yes, that's a kind of\nstrand of entrepreneurialism,
if you like.
I talked about being\nentrepreneurial
in order to kind of get out\nof this cycle of a system that
is eroding respect.
And I feel strongly about that.
And I think that large\npractices have the opportunity
to do that.
I mean, we're a\nrelatively small practice,
and we really push it.
And we really try, but if\nonly the larger practices
would get behind that.
But they probably won't because\nthat's not how they make money.
They're driven by a much\nmore commercial agenda,
which is an agenda that\nI'm not interested in.
And to do things that have\nkind of richness and depth
and refinement takes\na lot of commitment
and a real commitment from\neverybody in my office.
You have to be prepared\nto fail and fail again
before you get to the point that\nyou think you want to get to.
But for me, that's\nthe excitement
of being an architect.
And therefore, the people\nthat we attract to the office,
they have that too because it's\nwhere you get your feedback.
Hi.
About more than 20\nyears ago, I listened
to you give a talk in Cambridge,\nwhich was very impressive.
You had, like, a\ndouble slide deck
thing going on with two images.
And I specifically\nremember you being
very angry, I think,\nabout some of the things
that you guys were\ntrying to do, some
of the things that\nyou felt other people
were doing that you\ndidn't appreciate.
And you hadn't built as\nmuch back then, obviously.
And here you are, having built\na significant set of work
more than 20 years later.
So kind of joint question--
do you still feel you are\nsomewhat angry at anything?
And how do you feel\nthings have changed
for you over these years\nwith what you've been doing?
Well, I hope I didn't\ncome across as too angry
20 years ago.
I really had no need to be.
When I started with\nJan as Future Systems,
it was a really,\nreally slow trajectory.
And I guess-- and I know\nthe point that you're
making, that I used to put up\nslides to kind of demonstrate
that we got there in,\nlike, 10 years ago,
and they're just copying\nus, and you know, just
trying to make a point\nbecause it frustrated me
that we were doing all this\nkind of advanced guard work,
and others were\nprofiting from it.
But actually, so what?
That's just life.
You just have to be\nconfident that you
can be ahead of the game.
So no, I'm not angry now.
But maybe my frustration\nhas shifted to something
that I've already\nspoken about, which
is that I do think\nthe system that
exists at the\nmoment, the pressure,
when you're going for work, to\ndrive down your fees to suicide
levels in order to win\nthe job, it's wrong.
There are very few\nother professions
that would accept that.
And I think as a profession,\nwe have allowed ourselves
for respect to be\neroded, for our position
to be marginalized.
And I think it's about\ntime that we reclaim that.
The other thing that I'm really\ninterested to reclaim that
isn't really answering\nyour question,
but is this idea of risk as\na kind of positive force.
And I know that the kind of\nlitigious culture in America
is--
it doesn't exactly\nencourage you to take risks.
But if you look\nhistorically, you
can only advance\nby taking risks.
And the nature of\nbeing an architect,
most things that you build\nare totally kind of bespoke,
one-off.
And clients want that.
They demand it.
And yet, they want\nit to be risk-free.
So there's this real\nkind of built-in tension
that I just think we have to\nbe a bit more upfront about.
But I see being entrepreneurial\nas something hugely positive.
One of the biggest issues\nin the UK at the moment
is housing, affordable housing.
There isn't enough of it.
And what there is so low-grade.
And it's just wrong.
And why aren't practices\nlike ourselves,
why aren't we invited\nto do something?
OK, we're not.
We probably never will be.
So let's just accept that, and\nlet's create our own project.
Let's find a group.
Let's get people together.
Let's identify the unmet need.
Let's find the site.
Let's raise the money\nand propose something
as a test case.
So I think we can take something\nreally positive from that
and just drive it a bit more.
We've become too\nmuch the passenger.
One more question.
Oh.
Hi.
I have a question regarding the\nresearch work in the office.
I've seen some of\nyour projects are
more self-driven of a research,\nwhere kind of a research
branched out from a\ncommissioned work.
I was just wondering,\nhow do you balance
that in your practice of the\nresearch work that you do
and the commission work you do?
And also, how do you think that\nbenefited your ongoing projects
in the short-term\nand in the long-term?
And when you decide to\ninitiate a self-driven research
or the research derived\nfrom a commissioned project?
Thanks.
Well, yes, in a way,\nit's a kind of balance.
But when you-- there's a sort\nof impulse to do a research
project, a self-driven project.
And if you try and be too\nkind of pragmatic about it,
and too businesslike\nabout it, and can we
really afford to do this,\nyou'll never do anything.
So we are--
I'm sure we could be much\nmore commercially successful
if we didn't embark\non these things
and if we took a\ndifferent position,
but that's not the kind\nof practice we are.
And we're not going\nto be like that.
So it goes with the territory.
And the rewards\nthat you get are--
they're not commercial\nrewards, but they're
rewards in terms of the\nsatisfaction that you get,
the kind of intellectual\nfascination of pushing
something to its limits,\nand what you learn.
And it always becomes--
whatever you do becomes\npart of your repertoire.
And it's something that you can\nthen use again, refer back to.
And each project you do,\nyour repertoire gets bigger,
and your work gets\nricher as a result.
So for me, it's incredibly\nimportant to do that,
but it's not really--
I mean, the ceramic\ntable was, in a sense--
it was kind of perversely--
it was a little bit perverse,\nbut there was an impulse there
that just came because we were\ndoing all this work in ceramic,
and how could we\ntake that forward.
And I'm not sure how\nwe can, but I think
we'll come back to it one day.
And it was a great\nprivilege to work
with these extraordinary people\nwho work on aerospace projects
normally.
So it's part of\nour DNA to do this.
All right, so we want to say\nthank you very much, Amanda.
Well, thank you for having me.
[applause]
