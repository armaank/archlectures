All right.
So let's start.
It's really a great\nhonor and pleasure
to have Dr. Yvonne\nCagle with us today.
And I'm Fawwaz Habbal\nI'm the Executive
Dean of the School of\nEngineering Applied Sciences.
This activity here is under the\nauspices of our joint degree
with the Graduate\nSchool of Design.
Some of you know about it.
It's called a master's\ndegree in design engineering.
And it's very different\nfrom any degree at Harvard.
It's a collaborative degree.
And "collaborative degree"\nmeans both professors
from two different schools come\ntogether through the class,
and work together,\nand teach together,
which is really kind of a\nvery interesting experience.
I teach myself,\nthere, and it's quite
useful in many different ways.
This degree was built ground-up\nby faculty from both schools.
We believe this is\nthe best way of trying
to educate a cohort of students\nto learn how to problem solve.
And they come up with\nall kinds of solutions
for all kinds of\nopen-ended problems,
including things related,\nfor instance, year year,
we did food systems as\na business, as a waste,
as nutrition, as many things.
This year, we're looking\nat problems related
to technologies for\nthe elderly, including
things like loneliness, aside\nfrom other medical problems.
So we think this\nis a great degree.
And it's unique in its scope.
And it's unique also\nin its own students.
The students come from\na different cohort
of people who come\nfrom different areas,
including engineering, business\ntechnologies, architecture,
and many others.
So we're really fortunate to\nhave Dr. Yvonne Cagle today
with us.
Our speaker today combined\ntwo impressive careers.
Most of us consider\na career in medicine
as a wonderful endeavor.
A career as an astronaut\nwould be amazing.
You would agree with that.
But combining both is\nreally kind of unbelievable.
So it looks like\nDr. Cagle interest
in medicine started\nat an early age.
Apparently, and\nit's not surprising,
her father was in medicine.
And her mother was\nin the Air Force.
So you could see\nwhere [inaudible]..
But apparently, as\na young girl, she
would sneak into her\nfather's medical library,
spend hours looking at what?
X-ray images.
Now, she found these\nblack-and-white X-ray
images very inspiring, I\nguess, and she liked them.
And, she said,\nthey intrigued me--
so kind of interesting.
Her first degree\nwas in biochemistry.
She obtained it at\nSan Francisco State.
And then she moved to the\nUniversity of Washington
for the medical\nschool, where she
received her medical degree.
However, the medical school,\nas we all know, is expensive.
So she obtained a Fellowship\nfrom a scholarship
from the Air Force,\nwhere, later, she
had to spend several\nyears in the Air Force,
and that really\nfacilitated something else
that later, she'd\nget interested in.
At Brooks Air Force\nBase in Texas--
this is where she became\na certified flight surgeon
and enrolled in many\naero medicine programs.
And she served as the medical\nliaison for the Air Force
and NASA for several years.
She was working at the\nKelsey-Seybold Clinic
at the NASA Johnson\nSpace Center,
where she was an\noccupational-medicine
physician, when NASA officials\nasked her what would it
take for her to\nleave her beloved job
and do something outside that.
And she said, a strawberry\nsundae or go into space?
The answer was, we cannot do\nanything about this sundae,
but we can do something\nabout the other.
So that's how she entered the\narea as being an astronaut.
She flew several\ndifferent sorts of planes,
she served in the Air Force,\nshe went to the Gulf War
with the Air Force.
And finally, she applied for a\nprecious slot as an astronaut,
and she got it.
So Dr. Cagle has a\nvery impressive career
in the Air Force.
And she obtained many awards.
I can't cite all of them.
It takes me a while.
And I know you are not\nhere to listen to me.
So she got the Outstanding\nYoung Woman of America Award,
she got the National\nDefense Service Medal.
She has the medal from the\nAir Force for achievements
and several honorary degrees\nfrom different universities.
And she has been really, an\namazing participant in society
and service for the country.
So without further ado, I'd\nlike to introduce Dr. Cagle.
Wow, good evening.
I tell you, this day has\nbeen a long time in coming.
And this evening seemed like it\nwould never arrive, but it has.
I'm here.
We're here.
And the fun is just starting.
I thank you so much\nfor your gracious time
and your attention.
And I'm really looking\nforward to engaging
in this conversation.
I specifically asked\nfor design engineering,
because I wanted an\nintegrated, interdisciplinary,
collaborative effort.
And so I feel very honored, very\nprivileged to be here and would
like to share and engage\nsome of my perspectives
and experiences, but\nmore than anything else,
become your friend.
So with that, let's get started.
Talking about collaborative\nideas and design--
50 years ago, they said it was\nimpossible to walk on the moon.
Yet a dedicated academy\nof precision professionals
came together.
And they were actually able\nto, by way of space vision
and space technology, launch\nus in less than 10 minutes
into space; in less than\n90 minutes from liftoff,
around the Earth, in orbit;\nand in less than three days,
land us on the moon, all\nby way of working together
and believing in the impossible.
They said it couldn't be done.
And today, we continue to\npursue by way of things,
like the space shuttle\nand 17,500 MPH coming off
of 7 and 1/2 million\npounds of thrust,
where there's so much\nenergy that it could ignite
the fireworks in every\nOlympic city that
is hosting the Olympic games.
All of this is under\nyour seat, where
the sheer force of the vibration\nis so great that you never
actually see your first launch.
Your eyes are closed so\ntight that the only thing
you can remember is\nwhat you experience.
You experience\nthat first launch.
This is what it's like to\nnot only dream, but to train
and aspire for something even\ngreater than what's possible.
You're launched.
And best of all, it's been\neight minutes and 30 seconds.
And as you unbuckle\nyour seat belt,
you're 250 miles\nabove the Earth,
going 17,500 miles per hour\non your way to Mach 25.
And as you step out of\nyour seat, you're floating.
The first word out of\nyour mouth is, "Whoa!"
Guess what the second word is.
"Whoa!"
This is what it's like.
Or as Story Musgrave, one of\nmy favorite astronauts, said,
"It\'s like skating on glass."
So how does one get to float\nin less than 10 minutes, 250
miles above the Earth, with a\nview on science, technology,
engineering, art, math--
STEAM, a view on STEAM, or\nas I like to say, "TEAMS"--
much more collaborative--\nTechnology, Engineering, Art,
Math, and Science--
through the lens\nof weightlessness.
Well for me, it was\nall about trying
to make sure I moved at Mach 25.
My tricycle wasn't fast enough.
There wasn't a spaceship\nthat quite could get me
as far as I wanted to go.
And I wanted to take\nit a step beyond.
It all started at the top of\nan old oak tree, July 1969, one
hot summer night,\nwhen I was trying
to break the record\nfor hide and go seek.
Everybody who was\nlooking east and west.
But really, nobody was\nthinking to look north.
And that's where I was hiding.
Three hours into it, I hear\na voice calling my name.
Destiny-- had to be-- the\nonly reason I would come
down and not make that record.
And I heard that name call,\nYvonne, Yvonne, Yvonne.
And surely, I was ready\nto take that giant leap,
until I recognized that\nthat voice was just
my dad telling me to come down\nfrom the tree and come inside.
I tell you, I told him,\nit better be really good,
or else this was the last\ntime I'd listen to him.
And obviously, it must have been\npretty epic, because I'm still
listening to him today.
So instead of taking that giant\nleap, which probably wasn't
the smartest thing to do at\nthe age of 10, or even worse,
at the top of an old\noak tree at any age,
I came down, came\ninside, where he silently
pointed at this grainy image,\nback then, on an old TV--
black and white-- very\ngrainy, rabbit-ear antennas.
My job in the family of six\nkids was to sort of position
the antenna for The\nEd Sullivan Show.
But I wasn't being\nasked to do that.
I was being asked just\nto look at the screen.
And that grainy image,\nas I made it out,
my dad said, that it's human.
That is man walking on the\nmoon for the very first time.
Immediately, I ran outside\nand looked at the Moon,
because I had just been\ntalking to the man on the Moon,
dancing with the stars.
And I had to see this\nhappening firsthand.
And, oh, my gosh,\nguess what I saw?
Nothing.
So I ran right back inside to\nmake sure he was still on TV.
And sure enough, he's\nstill bouncing around,
walking on the Moon.
So I ran back outside to\nsee if I could see him.
And guess what I saw?
Nothing.
I did it again.
And OK, folks,\n10, 20, 25 times--
I never really saw anything.
But after a while, I realized\nthat what was more amazing than
what human must look like\nwalking on the moon is what I
must look like to\nhuman, granted,
a silly 10-year-old\ngirl running in and out,
trying to see a\nman on the Moon--
what I must look like from\nthat view on the Moon,
looking back on Earth.
And at that moment,\nmy dreams took wings.
And I knew then\nthat I too, one day,
wanted to see my\nfootprint on the Moon.
Fast forward.
Undergraduate, biochemistry,\nonto the University
of Washington\nSchool of Medicine,
where I earned my medical degree\non an Air-Force scholarship,
and spent the next 22\nyears yanking and banking
in a wide variety of\nhigh-performance aircraft,
from F-111 to F-15s,\nF-16s, F-18s, [? heavy, ?]
helicopters,\nair-to-air refuelers,
medevacs, you name it.
Anything going to altitude,\nI wanted to be in it.
22 years later, rising to\nthe rank of full Colonel
as a senior flight\nsurgeon, it couldn't
get any better than that,\nexcept for one thing.
15 years into it, I\nrealized that I actually had
intended to be an astronaut.
I kind was having a lot of fun.
And it slipped my mind.
It didn't actually slip\nmy mind, but at that time,
it was a different world.
And 15 years, I still wasn't\nable to put my dream at rest.
So at that 15-year--
we call it the "career mark,"\nI thought, wow, these jets,
as amazing as they\nare, they don't
seem to go quite fast enough,\nnor quite high enough.
I knew then that the\nonly way to go was up.
And at that time, the\nonly way to get there
was the space shuttle.
If I could put\npoetry to motion, I
would call it the space shuttle\nwith the Space Transportation
System, because in\nless than 10 minutes,
it's placing you at Mach 25.
And you're seeing the\nworld go by, literally,
floating the entire time.
That's poetry in motion.
So we've come a long way.
We've come from placing\nthe first human handprint
on a cave in France,\n30,000 years upward, ago,
all the way to that first\nfootprint on the Moon.
And yet, our journey has\njust begun, because folks,
we're going to Mars.
We are scheduled for 2035.
Go ahead mark your\ncalendars in case you
don't have anything booked yet.
But in order to be ready,\nwe're going by way of,
yes, we're going back to the\nMoon, back to the Moon in 2024.
In six years from now, we will\nbe returning for the first time
to do two cislunar missions,\neach one lasting 30 days.
And that is to prepare us for\nthat long journey to Mars--
a journey that will take,\nin most cases, nine months,
with a window that only comes\naround about every 18 months--
but working on\ndifferent propulsions
that might reduce that\ntime to six months.
In the meantime, we\nwant to test systems.
We want to the test\nsystem integrations--
in particular, the\nvehicle, satellites,
communications to make sure\nthat they're going to be robust.
So this time when we\ngo back to the Moon,
we'll also be going to\nthe dark side of the Moon,
meaning the side of the moon--
the backside-- where we haven't\nvetted communication yet.
We want to make sure that\nwe can reach back and talk
to home from all trajectories\nand orientations.
But we're not just looking at\nsystems for robotics, vehicles,
satellites, communication.
We're also looking\nat the human system.
Here we have Smithsonian Rex.
We've been able to, in so\nmany levels, replace, or test,
or create simulations\nof the human body
with robotic platforms--
eyes that have special\nocular implants,
ears that have the\nability to hear,
speech that can be\nsynthesized, blood
that can be circulated\nthroughout the tissue
in the lungs, synthetic\nlungs, heart, liver, spleen,
and even limbs that\nare robotic and are
able to grasp and rotate\nin 26 degrees of rotation
for the wrists, and the\nhands just one degree shorter
the human body, a spine\nthat can support you,
legs with shock-absorbers.
Now many of the robotics\nright here in the Boston area
are also evolving upon this.
NASA has Valkyrie a new\nrobot, the first woman robot,
who I saw today, and is really\ndoing some amazing things.
So we're getting the race won\nwhen it comes to robotics.
But going into space\nand exploration
isn't just about sending\nrobotic capabilities.
It's collaborative.
But the human heart\nwas born to explore.
And the only way\nto know is to go.
So to that end, we'll be looking\nat, and testing, and verifying
the human system--
everything from\nthe human genome.
We just had twin studies--
sending a twin to\nspace, who came back
showing that the\ngenome had shifted,
had altered, that the gene\nexpression of certain proteins
changed after almost\na year in space,
that the twin is no longer\ntechnically a twin anymore.
So we'll be looking at how\nthe human genome changes
with long duration, and\nweightlessness, and exposed
to radiation, and all the\ndifferent things that we'll
find when we're\nliving, and working,
and traveling through space.
We'll be looking at many\nsystems of the human body that
include the heart, the\nlung, the bones, the muscle.
But equally important is the\nmind, the behavior, the spirit,
the soul.
So we're looking at\nbehavioral wellness
and what neuroscientific,\nneurometric markers
may be able to serve\nas early indications
of behavioral drift,\nfor better or for worse.
But neurocognitive stressors,\nwhen you're in a remote,
isolated environment, have\nmany analogs here on Earth,
be it aging,\nmilitary deployments,
extreme adventures, submariners,\narctic-- and antarctic,
or we call them "polar\nsimulations" or "biohabitats"--
many correlations.
But the major differences, are\nin space, you're weightless.
That's a cool stressor.
But it also takes three\ntimes as long to do things.
And you can't just\nopen a window or door
when you need to take a deep\nbreath or get some fresh air.
So we look at all\nof those things
and how we can work to not only\nidentify them, but mitigate,
or train, or track them in\na way that we can intervene,
so that we can maintain harmony\nthroughout the crew, mission
safety, and mission success.
But not all stressors are bad.
There's something called\nsalutogenics, which
is, when you're in an\nextreme environment,
that some stressors can\nactually foster independence,
self-reliance, interdependency\nwithin a group that
can build resiliency for\nthe individual, the group,
and group cohesiveness.
So we're also looking at those\nsorts of changes as well.
So it's important to\nknow that when humans go,
it's the whole body--
the mind, the\nbody, and the soul.
But one of our\nbiggest challenges
is going to be finding ways\nto treat illness and injury.
The NASA biocapsule\nis an inert vessel,
or I should say a capsule,\nthat slips under the skin
and can be placed in different\nportions of the body,
and can not only detect certain\ninfections, illnesses, cancers,
diabetes, but it can actually\ntreat, via a delivery system
for medication.
But there are so many things\nthat challenge the body.
Early on, this is what we\ncall the "iron apron," which
is a way of trying to\npush the body's blood back
into the torso and the head\nwhen it pools in the legs.
It's trying to normalize\nthings in space.
So when you're in\nspace, your blood volume
actually floats towards\nyour head and accumulates
in your chest.
So it's important\nto kind of balance
that out, to have a\nnegative-pressure system that
can suck it back down.
And that's what\nthe iron apron does
when you're in space so\nthat when you come back,
you are able to\ncontinue to perform
while you're upright\nwithout becoming
light-headed or passing out.
We can train this on the\nground before you even
go to space to induce\nthat stress, or that load,
to build your build your\ntone or your resiliency.
But the bigger challenge\nwe actually have
is muscle and bone.
So as I said, in only eight\nminutes and 30 seconds,
you're 250 miles above\nthe Earth, going Mach 25,
and you're floating.
It doesn't get any\nbetter than that.
But at only eight\nminutes and 31 seconds,
you are already losing\nin the space race
physiologically, because\nphysiologic gradient,
immediately upon\nweightlessness, shifts,
just like a wave\ndoes in the ocean.
We're 70% water, and\nwe get that same kind
of wave transition or upheaval.
So what happens?
When you enter into space,\nit's the physiologic equivalent
of having run six\n40-k marathons,
and each time, somebody\ntapping you on the shoulder
and going, great race, but your\nfinish lines at starting line.
Start all over again.
So your body is really working.
And over time, your\nmuscles weaken, atrophy.
Your bones start to thin\nout, or demineralize.
And that creates\ndifficulties when
you're needing to move about, be\nit for your day-to-day living,
put on a space suit, or\ndo emergency procedures.
Now that's a challenge\nwe have on a good day.
On a bad day, a simple sprain\ncan really incapacitate you,
because after three\nmonths of weightlessness,
even your growth hormone\nstarts to diminish.
And over time, you can lose\nup to 10% of your muscle mass
and strength.
When that happens, in six\ndays, after your growth hormone
starts to drop off,\nin only six days,
you already start to weaken.
And if you have an injury\nor a simple sprain,
six days can be the\ndifference between you
being a visitor to Mars or being\na colonizer, because you're not
able to climb back\nonto the spaceship.
So it's very important that we\nfind ways to rescue ourselves,
should we have illness\nor injury in space.
So looking through the lens of\nMars at what seems impossible,
how are we not going\nto injure ourselves?
Is there a solution on\nEarth that we can look to?
Is there a solution in what\nwe call "Earth exploration"?
There are so many benefits that\nwe've learned in going to space
that we can bring\nback down to Earth,
because space is no\nlonger just a destination.
It is a journey.
It's a demonstration platform\nfor so many technologies
and capabilities.
But are there\nthings here on Earth
that can help us in\nspace, in particular,
when our bodies become\nweak or injured?
Well, yes, there is.
It\'s called "Lift."
What is Lift?
Lift is taking weeks of therapy\nand reducing it to days--
days of pain into minutes.
Lift is something that was\ndeveloped and refined over
30-plus years, and appears\nto be able to accelerate
the restoration and resiliency\nof inflamed sprains and strains
on the limbs that may\nbe days or decades old--
and in most cases, in\njust a matter of minutes.
How does it work?
Well, first of all, it took\na lot of work to get there--
25 years of\nbiochemistry, and all
told, about 30 years\nof design engineering,
starting with trying\nto solve a problem,
and realizing that the solution\nlies in our own bodies.
Our body already\ndoes this naturally.
So how can we amplify,\nor augment that?
And that's what\nLift basically does.
It regeneratively takes\nthe energy from injury
and uses it to\nmobilize and rebalance
injured and inflamed tissue\nso that the injury is
able to self-correct,\ncorrect itself.
It's pretty remarkable.
What does it look like?
Well, ask me what 10\nminutes looks like.
Here we have a sprained knee--
pretty evident-- a lot\nof bleeding and swelling.
No fracture or problem on\nthe X-ray, but certainly,
a lot of pain, upwards\nof 8, 9 out of 10 pain,
difficulty weight-bearing,\nlocking the knee, walking.
This would normally take\nseveral weeks-- six to 10 weeks
in order to correct.
Here's your after-picture.
The bruise will take a little\nbit of time to go away.
But the swelling is noticeably\ndown, knee is locked,
there's no pain, and\nthey're running stairs.
That's what 10\nminutes looks like.
It's not me.
It's not man.
It's not medicine.
It's wearable you-- yes, a\nwearable solution for you.
And it's innovative,\nit's transformative,
and it's here, right here.
Fits in a little case.
Studies pending, but if you want\nto know more about it, please,
don't hesitate to\nsee me afterwards.
But you know what I\nreally want to spotlight
is more than just the\nbody's amazing capacity
to heal itself.
What I really want\nto talk about is
the power possessed in the\npursuit of the impossible.
In a world that seems\nlike it's gone awry,
there are actually at least\ntwo things that we all still
have control over--
what we believe\nand what we dream.
And if you put the\ntwo together, you
can empower yourself\nto the point
where even the impossible has\npotential, because really,
what is the impossible anyway?
If you decode the word\n"impossible," what do you get?
"I m possible."
So in closing, what\ndream and what dream
trajectory do you believe in\nenough that could possibly
course-correct this\nmother ship we call Earth,
and conceivably change\nthe course of time?
How do you do it?
Well, as an astronaut,\nI'd like to say
it's not all that difficult,\nbecause all you have to do
is bring poetry in motion\nback down to Earth,
and then use it to relaunch\nyour dream back to the Moon,
on to Mars, and\npush your potential,
push your envelope somewhere far\nand beyond whatever lies just
on the other side of\nthe "I am possible."
Thank you.
And [latin].
And while you're\nthinking of questions,
I'd like to share with you kind\nof that journey in developing
innovation, because when\nyou're in something like design
engineering, I envy you.
I actually wish that\ninstead of being up here,
I was in the seat\nwhere each of you are.
And for me, that\njourney started way back
in high school physics.
And it continued through\nmy Girl-Scout years,
when I was learning all about\nadventure, and traveling,
and hiking.
Then at the University\nof Washington,
I was part of a\nprogram called WWAMI,
where you could train throughout\nthe Washington, Alaska,
Montana, and Idaho area.
So I did trauma and rescue in\nthe desert, Montana, Alaska.
And we were always given some\nvery sophisticated equipment.
But it never failed--\nthe air compressor didn't
work at altitude, there\nwere no plugs in the desert,
and pretty much, all you had\nwas the MAST trousers to use
as, really, the first wearable.
So we would find ways to\ncreatively wrap, load, and go.
And even your boot\nwas a lifesaver,
because you just didn't\nwant to take that off.
It really contained\ninjury, and swelling,
and inflammation quite a bit.
So over the years, I\ncarried that with me
as a flight surgeon.
And going to rescue areas\nand accident scenes,
I was able to continue\nto evolve that.
Now, I loved doing that as a\nGirl Scout, in medical school,
and in the Air\nForce, but I really
wanted to take it, as\nI said, faster, higher,
and more of a\nchallenge-- really,
touch the edge of\nthe impossible.
And so I thought, no\nbetter place than Mars.
And when I decided that I wanted\nto really find a way to solve
a problem, I went back into that\ndream of the impossible and all
of the learning and experience\nthat came up through the years,
and I use that knowledge to\nreally think about how you can
have a self-rescue device\nthat is not powered,
that is made up of parts\nof the spaceship itself,
or the packaging, or\nthe cargo material,
because that's all you've got to\nwork with-- or your own suit--
and that it had to be\nsomething that was simple,
that you could do it even if\nyou were really deconditioned.
But it had to be fast,\nbecause you're losing muscle
over a six-day period of time.
And when you put all of that\ntogether, it looks impossible.
But when you really\nthink about how
nature does it, how\nour bodies do it,
and the whole concept of design\nengineering, it's doable.
And it's really transformative.
So we've been really\nhelping so many people
And so many walks of\nlives and now we're
ready to take it faster higher\nand see if we can do something
to not just help the\nmission but in learning how
to help the mission\nbring it back
and help those in underdeveloped\ncountries disaster situations--
any situation where someone\nneeds rapid self-rescue
but doesn't have access to\nthe resources or the equipment
to regain their resiliency.
So that's kind of the\nstory behind that.
.
Can I go?
Thank you again, for being here.
I'm wondering if you could\ntalk a little bit more
about the role that\nrobots will play
in the next mission, the 2024\nmission that you brought up,
and maybe the relationship\nbetween those robots
and the humans that may\nbe accompanying them
on the journey, or working\ntogether for that mission.
Outstanding question.
The way that the robotic\nconversation evolved
was, for the longest time there\nwas a question about robots
or humans?
Robots or humans?
And I never felt like\nthat was a question.
So now, we evolved\nto the point where
it's really a cooperative,\ncollaborative effort.
There are some things that\nrobots do very well, very
reliably, very reproducibly.
And there are some things that\nthe human mind and experience
does in a very innovative,\nquickly adaptive fashion.
So although ultimately, we plan\non having shared operations,
where a lot of the\nwork, and maintenance,
and housekeeping, or risky\nthings can be done by robots.
And that frees it\nup for human crews
to be able to do so much\nmore of the innovation,
and the science,\nand the engineering.
And it really is a\ngreat opportunity
to make the scope of astronaut\nexperience even broader,
because we're offloading\na lot of the busy work
that we're doing\nright now on station.
But the more important\nrole that the robots
will play, especially in the\nupcoming missions cislunar
and Mars, is they'll\nbe precursor missions.
Even before we go in 2024, we'll\nbe sending robotic capabilities
ahead of us, who can actually\nstart to set things up,
3D print, start to build\nor put together habitats.
I always say, if you're\ngoing to do an expedition
off the planet, you\nhave to figure out
how to build your house\nwhen you can't go outside.
That's a challenge for humans.
But robots can do that.
They can go in and out, like\nthat silly 10-year-old girl,
and be building the\nfacility so that when
we do go, then our fuel\ndepots, our habitats,
our equipment will\nalready be up and running
and ready to go, along with\nsome life-support systems.
It's the best welcome\nwagon you'll probably ever
run into on this planet or off.
Very fascinating vision\nand possibilities, yes.
Thank you again, for your talk.
It was amazing.
My question is about the twins.
You said one of them had\nbeen changed after a year
being in space, which I think\nyou are talking about astronaut
Kelly.
Yes.
So what kind of change is that?
Did it an effect on his personal\nlife or daily normal life?
We're still sorting out\nthe details on that.
But what he has described\nis that when he came back,
he was significantly\ndeconditioned.
And that's one of the\nreasons we decided
to pursue, or continue\npursuing, a lunar mission first,
because we do have\nto figure out how
to keep the body robust\nand resilient in that way.
It took him an extended period\nof time to rehabilitate.
And it was very\nnoticeable to him.
As important as mission\nsuccess is the satisfaction
or the ability of\nthe crew member
to reintegrate into their\nfamilies, and societies,
and their quality of life.
And that can be very\nimpeded or impaired when
you're incredibly\ndeconditioned, as you
can imagine, from any\nkind of illness or injury.
But this isn't that.
This is just been in space\nfor a long period of time,
being in weightlessness.
The other thing that he said,\nwhich was very interesting,
what was even more\nchallenging were
some of the psychological\ndrifts and conditions
that he experienced.
And he said, even more\nthan the physical impacts,
we really do need\nto get our arms
around the psychological\nexperiences and transitions
that happen, not unlike we\nsee with our deployments
or people in our polar habitats.
So we're doing more\nof those simulations.
But it is something that needs\nto be anticipated and prepared
for.
So for that reason,\nthat's another system
that we're going to be\nreally focusing on as well.
Yes.
Along the side of\nthis identical twin.
You mentioned about\nthe identical twin
is no longer identical.
So is that something reversible?
That's one question.
The second question\nis, does the human body
adapt to the\nweightless conditions
so the loss of muscle or\nbone stops at one point,
or just continue to lose it?
Excellent question.
So the first question--
are those genetic changes\nthat have been detected--
are they reversible?
We don't know yet.
But the way that genes work,\nyour DNA and everything,
they create these genes.
And genes express\ncertain proteins
that give you the\ncharacteristics that you see.
And so it'll be\ninteresting to see at what
levels those changes occurred.
Were they in the\nnucleotide-base sequences
of the DNA in the chromosomes?
Or were they more in the enzymes\nor the genes themselves in what
they expressed?
And gene expression responds\nto your environment.
It response to radiation,\nit response to loads,
it responds to nutrition, things\ninside and outside of the body.
So it'll be interesting\nto see, based
on the other twin,\nif any of that does
start to change back in\nwhat it's expressing now
that it's come into a\ndifferent environment.
I think that's a\nfascinating question
is to see what is really\nnascent to weightlessness
and the environment of\nspace and radiation,
and what has that\nkind of resiliency,
or reversibility, that can kind\nof reset or change once you
change that environment.
Fascinating question.
Yes, sir.
Thanks for the talk.
And recently, I'm just working\non a prosthetics project
by myself. and I\njust wondered, what
was your most credible and\nreliable devices in space?
My most reliable what in space?
Devices.
Devices in space--\noh, prosthetic and--
before I answer that question,\nlet me just hop back,
because it actually\nrelates to your question.
In terms of, do the changes\nthat we see in muscle and bone--
do they plateau off?
And for short-duration missions,\nanywhere from two weeks, three
months, even six\nmonths, we do see
that the muscle loss seems\nto plateau off at about 10%,
both mass and strength.
In bone in particular,\nyou lose about 1% a month,
but somewhere around 17%, then\nit seems like it plateaus off.
Now, that means that\nthere's probably
some early acceleration.
Or maybe you're pretty\nresilient at the beginning
of losing bone.
But it's kind of like a drain.
As you start to reach\na critical threshold,
you start to lose\nmuch more rapidly.
But it seems when you hit that\n17%, that it plateaus off.
However, we don't know what\nwill happen if suddenly, you
change the\nenvironment, or you're
in space for a longer period\nof time in transit to Mars.
Will, again, those\ngenes or those enzymes
reactivate, and start to\nsay, we're in weightless.
There's no resistance.
We don't need this\nextra mass and bone,
and that start to\nactivate or reactivate
the loss that's going on.
So that's one of\nthe things we hope
to determine, again, with a\n30-day lunar-base mission.
And then in terms of space, our\nbest prosthetic or best tool--
let's see.
We haven't had the\nneed, necessarily,
of human prosthetics\nat this point,
although robots will be a\nwhole different equation.
But we have used some\nof those space concepts
to help with load-balancing,\nand strategies, and shifting
of center of gravity that we\nhave to adjust for in space.
And that's developed\nunderstanding, and protocols,
and solutions that\nwe can actually
use to refine prosthetics\nright here on Earth.
So with the robot earlier\ntoday, the NASA robot Valkyrie
was amazing, because a robot\nactually walks differently
than a human does.
We tend to do heel-to-toe.
And when we're going\nto take a step,
we don't just take\nthe weight off.
We transfer the\nweight to the foot
that hasn't even planted yet.
And that's kind of risky.
But the way the robot works is\nthe leg, the foot will raise.
But all the weight\nis still there
until the robot is able to gauge\nthat, OK, the balance is good,
the terrain is good, this\nis going to be a good plant.
So that might be something\nthat we incorporate
in some of our mobility\ndevices with individuals
who have mobility-issues here.
And also, the way that the robot\nshifts the center of gravity
is very fascinating,\nbecause we can
use that for load-balancing,\nagain, for transfer issues.
The best tools\nthat we're finding
tend to be tools that\nwe can 3D print--
so wrenches, and nuts,\nand bolts, and sockets.
And in particular,\nmedical equipment
is very amenable to 3D\nprinting and 3D design.
And what we really\nlove about 3D printers
is that you can\ninnovate on the spot.
You can design on the spot.
So when you're in\nweightlessness,
the tool that you need\nmay look very different
than the way it's used in Earth.
And you can redesign\na wrench, or a socket,
or something that can be very\ncustomized for not only what
the interface is, not only\nthe environment of something
floating-- you may\nwant it angled--
but also, you're floating too.
So you're coming in at your work\nspace, or your work surface,
at a different orientation.
And you may need a tool\nwith a different angle
or curvature to help\nyou engage that.
So all those things, I think,\nare really fascinating.
And you all are in a\nposition to design a way.
I think you should\nall be astronauts
so that you can make sure we\nhave the tools that we need.
We'll consign or\ncommission you all.
I have a question\nrelated to this stress.
You mentioned that\ngravity, of course,
has a way of expressing\nsome stresses.
Have you or anyone studied\nthe effects of other stresses,
like electromagnetic\nfields effecting our bodies
in any fashion.
And it would be very\ndifferent, probably, on Mars
and being closer to the Sun.
Well, we see a number of things.
First of all, in weightlessness,\neverything floats.
Things outside of\nyour body float,
and things inside\nyour body float.
So we're now doing Earth-normal\nultrasounds to find out what
our Earth-normal, or Earth-based\npositions of our organs are,
because when you go into space,\nif you develop appendicitis,
or something happens, and\nsomebody has to go in and do--
in most cases, we're\ngoing to do laparoscopic,
so through a scope--
some kind of surgery, and we\nneed to access that organ,
we need to have an idea\nof where it floated to.
So after you get into space,\nand we reultrasound just
to know your space-normal\nlook is like.
So you kind of change.
We're going in search of aliens.
But we change so much that maybe\nthe alien we go in search of
is ourself.
So that's one thing is we need\nto know what that map quest
look is of our organs.
But the other thing\nthat happens is
because of the weightlessness\nof space, radiation,
nutritional changes, the\nchanges in our microbiome--
meaning those organisms\nthat live within us--
those things change.
So in so many ways, not just\nour DNA, not just our genes,
but our organs, our\nintestinal flora,
the microbes that are in our\nbodies-- all of these things
change.
So we really are a different\nperson when we come back home.
But those things will also\nstress your immune system
so that you've got this\nimmuno-strain going on.
You're much more vulnerable\nto colds, and viruses,
and latent viruses, and at\nincreased risk of certain kind
of latent cancers.
And because you're in\na confined environment,
if one person gets sick, then\neverybody is at greater risk
to get sick.
So our infection surveillance\nand control before,
during, and after we come\nback is really important.
So yeah, it's a fascinating,\nvery dynamic look,
which is why, if I\never get boots on Mars,
I don't want to visit.
I want to colonize, because\nthe only way you're really
going to see the\nend of the movie
is to be there and watch\nit evolve in front of you.
So I'll be there-- your\nwelcoming committee.
I won't look the same.
I won't behave the same.
Trust me.
Thanks for the talk.
And I guess related to that, how\ndo you see the colony looking?
As an architecture and\nurban-design student,
it's fascinating-- the\nidea of these robots kind
of having designed and build\nthe colony before we even
get there.
But is NASA looking at\nthe actual design of that?
And how does that\ngravity atmosphere
affect the architecture?
And how you see it?
Great question.
Yeah, so fascinating--\nthere are actually
simulations where\nthey're building
robotic cities, smart\ncities, and using robots
to do the design to test it out.
So we're watching\nthose very closely?
Bigelow has inflatable\nhabitats, kind of
like for those of you\nwho remember the--
I know Lincoln Logs, I'm\ndating myself-- but you know,
where you used to plug\nthem together as a kid?
Well, now they have\nan inflatable version
that you can make different\nmodules and habitats.
And those are already being\nused in space by NASA as cargo.
And come 2020, Bigelow is going\nto have an even larger one
that we could actually\nuse for human habitation.
We've already put in\nlife-support systems.
We've been having\nastronauts go in them
in order to test the\nenvironment with sensors
and take different readings.
But those are the\nkind of habitats
we're looking at right\nnow-- inflatable habitats.
But ultimately,\nfor colonization,
and as we build\ncities and all, I
think the fascinating\nview would be
some kind of geodesic design,\nsomething that's frictionless,
weightless.
And the question is, is it going\nto be above or below ground?
Radiation is a problem.
And although water is one\nof the best combatants
against, or protectants against,\nradiation, a lot of weight,
a lot of uplift.
You want to make orbit.
So we really have to find\nthe water where we're going.
But one of the ways to\nprotect from radiation
may be to have caves, or\nto go underground and have
that as being your living city.
So there's different\nways we can do it.
Also, the regolith of the\nMoon-- regolith is moon dust,
moon dirt, basically--
and that has some\nradiation-protective qualities
as well.
We can do titanium,\npolycarbonate, aluminum?
I'm just throwing all\nthat out there to you
design engineers just so\nyou know that those are just
the options we know.
And every day, we're coming\nup with smart materials
and textiles that are\nlightweight and malleable.
So who knows?
Anything's possible.
Hi.
Referencing your comment\nthat we might be the alien,
and thinking about how artists\nand science-fiction writers
have often been the\nones to float ideas that
made it comfortable for\nus to think about some
of these things, and then blend\nthem in with what science is
actually doing or thinking,\nwe look at this twin
with a changed genetic DNA.
What have we seen that\nmight be an upside
to the change in human body?
I mean, if the\nhuman body is going
to change, and we're trying to\nfigure out how to stabilize it,
or pause it, or restart\nit, what if it went on?
Could there be\nchanges that could
be positive to enable us to go\nthen and do what we need to do?
Absolutely.
The whole reason\nthat the body changes
is that it's trying to\nadapt to its environment
and build up its\nstrength and resiliency.
So the body isn't really\nworking against us.
It's not so much our alien.
It's our friend.
It's saying that, I'm\nnot going to give you
a whole lot more workload\nwith all this muscle and bone.
I'm going to lighten it\nup, because it doesn't
know you have an intention\nof returning back to gravity
or going to alter-gravity\nenvironments,
or coming back home.
And that's the efficient way.
The body's always working\ntowards efficiency.
So if you have a colonizer,\nor somebody who's
going to continue to\ntravel interstellarly,
then they, over\ntime, will evolve
and look different\nand be very efficient
for their environment.
And so it'll be\ninteresting to see
what happens when we\nstart having families,
because those things happen\nat a very early stage.
So there are changes\nthat may occur
in the womb that will create\na different look, performance,
and capability.
We interpret everything\nhere on Earth
through the lens of gravity.
But I got to tell you,\nif you do the math,
the best the astronauts are\nnot your gold-medal Olympic
runners, swimmers,\nand other athletes.
It's going to be somebody\nwho may have spent
the majority of their life\nor an extended period of time
in a wheelchair, and their\nbody has changed and adapted.
And they have tremendous--\nnot only upper-body strength,
but their brain has\nneurocognitively upper-body
strategy.
It knows how to think\nwith the upper body.
In space, your legs\nare a liability.
They're just a\nplasma-volume sump.
There's no weight in space.
But if there was,\nthe closest thing--
we would look like the legs.
But we think in terms of\nour legs, our mobility,
our transfer, our prosthetics,\nhow we move about.
I love 3D printers,\nbecause somebody
gets a sprained\nfinger or an ankle,
now we have something that can\nturn that around, potentially,
in a matter of minutes.
So it may be a moot point.
But we can customize\na splint, or a brace,
or something like\nthat on the spot.
It's going to save a lot of\nspace and up-mass as we go.
But I think the body is\ngoing to sort of naturally
find its own way to build its\nstrength and its resiliency.
So if somebody has been in space\nfor an extended period of time,
it will be interesting to see if\ntheir life-support requirements
are the same.
Maybe they'll need less\noxygen, less water.
Maybe they'll be more\ntolerant being outside.
And somebody who has lived\ntheir life in a wheelchair--
they may know how to\nhave a space brain
and think about how\nto efficiently move
and engage and\nproblem-solve much more
effectively and faster than us,\nwho wait till our legs get us
to where we need to be,\nand then they position us.
And we've got a tool\nthat's based on a leg
brain that was vetted in Earth.
So it's a whole different world.
Yeah, I would say\nour instructors here
on Earth would probably be those\nfolks who don't necessarily
get the credit and the attention\nfor the subject-matter experts
that they are, living\nin an upper-body world,
or a sensory-dampened\nworld in space's vacuum.
So sound is going\nto be dampened.
It's going to be dark and dim.
So somebody whose\nvision isn't so great
but has adapted to\nthat here on Earth--
all of these folks will be\nour subject-matter experts
when we go to space.
Another question?
If there is none--
There is one.
Thank you so much for coming.
This so cool.
Hey, me too.
I think the same.
Hey, two-- two,\ndo we have three?
Four, 12, OK.
I was wondering, what\nare the different things
you do for sleep?
I know that sleep\ncycles are really
weird when you're up in space.
And I know that space\ntravel is very different,
but Mars has a different\ntime of day-and-night cycle.
So what are different\nways that they
have to do with\nalertness or performance
when the light is\ndifferent and things?
Right.
That's probably one of\nthe biggest problems
that adds to the\nbehavioral drift
from neurocognitive stressors.
It's going to be sleep\nand sensory deprivation.
And the sleep is partly\nbecause-- remember
the slide where you\ntake your seat belt off,
and you're floating, and\nthe, ah, and the first word
out of your mouth is, "Whoa"?
Well, that stays.
And that stays 24/7.
It's just like your brain\nis just like, wow, this
is awesome.
This is cool, right?
And so it's hard to sleep.
So we know that our sleep\ncycle is very much truncated,
meaning it's narrowed.
It's telescoped.
It's reduced.
And we know, on average, a\ngood night's sleep, at best,
is probably only six hours.
We don't know--\nwell, we do know--
but a large part of that\nis just the excitement.
I mean, you're in space.
Who wants to sleep?
You don't want to miss anything.
But also, there's a\ncircadian misalignment
with light-dark cycles\nand the neurohormones
that the pituitary,\nand hypothalamus,
and other regulatory organs are\naffected by, and your melatonin
as well.
We don't have a\nhandle on all of that.
We don't fully understand it.
But that doesn't\nmean that we can't
try different things that\ncan be a potential solution,
or at least improve.
So we try to do different\nthings with the lighting.
We have certain light\nvalues that we use.
And even, we're looking at\nautomated dimmer switches that
dim the station\nat different times
to sort of give you\nthat sense of nigh, day.
The problem is, most\ncases, you have two shifts.
And so if you've got shifts\nthat are 180 to each other,
then it's hard to control\nwhat that day-night cycle is
going to look like.
So it may be something that you\ncan only do in the sleep cabin,
because if you dim\nthe switch at a time
when the night shift is\nneeding to work and see things,
that can be a safety and\nperformance issue as well.
So we're looking at those\ndifferent sorts of things.
And the lighting\nis important, too,
for the plants that\nwere growing, as well,
because all life\nrequires this kind
of light-dark day-night cycle.
And your whole metabolic\nsystem, your biorhythm,
is tied to that as well.
And if you don't have that--
it's interesting, in space,\nthere's not a lot of that,
so it's not surprising.
Life isn't [? rampant. ?]\nBut certainly, over time,
if you lose that\nability, if you develop
that circadian misalignment, and\nyou lose that cycling ability,
that can be very stressful.
We see cortisol levels go up.
And there's something\ncalled adrenal fatigue,
or adrenal failure, where you\njust kind of in overdrive,
and the histamine is\njust churning away.
And it starts to take its toll\nand have effects on your health
and wellness, let\nalone your performance
and your behavioral coherence.
Great question.
Exercise, nutrition,\neating right,
magnesium-- all those\nthings are really
important to help\nwith sleep as well.
Now it's not so much\nhow long you sleep,
although it's important.
But it's also the\nquality of sleep.
So you've got to get through\nall the stages of sleep
so that you can get into your\ndeep sleep, which is not REM.
It's after REM.
It's that kind of deep,\nrestorative sleep.
And so if you don't\nget down that far,
then you really\nare not refreshing
your glymphatics, glial\nand lymphatic system
to detox your body.
Hello.
You shared a very exciting\ntimeline for a human mission
to Mars.
And it seems that you have\na pretty clear idea of what
the milestones are\nthat we have to meet,
and the things are\nthat we need to know,
and the things that we\nneed to have in order
to meet that deadline.
What do you think are the\nmain things that might go
wrong that could force\nus to delay that timeline
for a long time?
What could delay?
Now do you mean\nrobotics or humans?
I mean, it seems like\nit's pretty soon.
In 2030, we're going to Mars.
Yeah, it's coming\nvery fast, exactly.
Is it knowledge development?
Is it funding?
What do you see\nthat could force us
to take much longer\nthan we technically
could take to get to Mars?
Yes.
In other words, I'm saying,\nyes, to all the things--
technology, funding.
But you can have all\nthe money in the world,
but if you don't\nhave the solutions
or the validated\ndesigns, then you're
still sort of in the middle\nof the ocean without any oars.
On the other hand, you can\nhave amazing turbo oars,
but not have the funding\nto be able to launch you
on those expeditions.
So it's a combination of things.
So it is funding, it is\nthe engineering, the tools,
the robotics, the\ncapability, the human system.
We do have to figure out\nhow to shield and protect
humans, the vehicle, and\nthe human body itself.
And if we don't, we\ndo have to come up
with ways of coming up with,\nhow do we harvest our stem
cells in order to reimplant\nour immune system if we just
want to expose ourself?
One big radiation\nhit is actually
better than having shielding\nthat might dissipate it into 50
smaller ones that last longer.
So we have to think\nabout all these things.
But I think the\nbiggest limiter of all
is our ability to\nthink outside the box.
There's your shirt.
Exactly.
Is the ability to\nthink outside the box?
Is the ability to pursue that\nwhich appears impossible?
Is the ability to\ninspire, and enable,
and empower our next generation?
Is our ability to be inclusive\nand diverse so that we can have
lots of different solutions?
Is our ability to\nbe collaborative
and to team together?
Is our ability to dream and to\nbelieve that those dreams have
the power to come true if\nwe work together as a team,
in teams?
Yvonne, I want to thank\nyou for two things.
One is, of course, your life\nstory, that you inspire us,
and also, for these visions\nfor the future that should also
be very inspiring.
So thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
