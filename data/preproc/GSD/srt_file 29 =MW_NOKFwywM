- Good evening.
My name is Mohsen Mostafavi.
I am the dean here.
And I just wanted to welcome\nall the admitted MDes/ MDE
candidates here to the GSD.
It's really wonderful\nthat you're here.
I had hoped that we would\nactually meet earlier today
and we would have\nsome time together,
but somehow our\ncalendars didn't quite
work out at exactly the right\ntime that was good for you.
So I'm really happy to\nbe extending a welcome.
I'm so happy that you're here.
I hope you've had a good day.
Both the MDes and\nthe MDE programs
are really such important\nparts of the school.
And over the last,\nprobably, five or six years,
we've spent a lot of time\ntrying to work on ways in which
the focus--
the attention-- that\nthese programs receive
is something that is at the\nforefront of our attention.
I think a lot of our faculty\nhave been really focused
on this.
We are so proud\nof the faculty who
are involved with this program.
And we're so proud of the\npeople who are participating
in these programs.
What is really, in a sense,\nsignificant about both the MDes
and the MDE program is that\nthey're really dealing with
significant domains of\nthought that have important
consequences, in terms of the\nbuilt environment, broadly,
and that they also are designed\nso that they are simultaneously
areas of specialization--\nof focus--
but they also\nenable a great deal
of interaction between them.
And this is important, in a way,\nto be able to come to the GSD
and to concentrate\non a particular area,
but at the same time know\nthat there is, in a way,
a kind of broader milieu--
there is a broader context for\nthe work that you are doing--
and that you are able to\nparticipate and engage
with a much richer, in a\nsense, domain of interaction
across these\ndifferent disciplines.
And I think the open\nprojects that you've
been hearing about today is\nalso a more recent attempt
to try and make their\nconcept of interaction
across their different tracks of\nthe MDes program, for example,
much more formally\nlocated, which
I think is also very important.
Obviously, we would love\nto-- after the talk--
to hear from you if you have\nany thoughts or questions.
And once again, it's\ngreat that you are here.
Those people who are here\nfor the MDE program--
of course, we're now going to\nbe entering the second year
of the MDE program.
And that has also been\nsuch a vital program,
based on the collaboration\nbetween the GSD and SEAS,
which is the\nengineering school here,
and really focusing on\nsort of key challenges
that face us and\nface the environment,
and at the same\ntime combining that
with entrepreneurial approaches\ntowards addressing those.
So in a way, the\nvarious tracts that
are in the MDes program, the\neight tracts, many of them
benefit, I think,\nfrom the work--
the artistic practice of Janet--
who's here with us, I think--
Janet Cardiff.
We're so happy\nthat you are here.
And as you know\nfrom the material
that I think some of\nyou have received,
Janet has been working for quite\nsome time with her partner,
George Bures Miller.
And after living in Berlin\nfor quite some time,
then moved back to\nCanada some 10 years ago,
and has been very much\nengaged with her practice
across the globe in many\ndifferent locations.
One of the things\nthat I sometimes
feel when we're working\nin the field of design,
and we make projects,\nwe make drawings,
is that it's\noccasionally a little bit
akin to making a kind of\nsilent movie in a way.
Because you make models.
You make assumptions\nabout the people who
will be living in these things.
But it's all either\nin the imagination
or it's in the realm of\ndrawings and models, in a way.
And so the thoughts\nthat we all have about
how a landscape will live,\nhow a house will be occupied,
and how a city will be a\nplace for its inhabitants
is actually constantly in\nthe realm of our imagination.
I think the work that Janet and\nher partner are involved with
is really a world\nthat also helps to--
through sound, through other\nforms of participation,
through movement,\nthrough working--
makes that world alive.
And we have been very\nmuch-- many of us--
enthusiastic about\nthis kind of practice--
about the relationship between\nperformance and, in a way,
the way in which\nwe imagine things.
And that intersection\nof performativity
and the spatial dimension\nof our practices
is really something\nthat is absolutely
critical to what we do.
It's with that in mind that,\nalso a few years ago, we
set up, for example,\nwhat we call
a platform here\nat the GSD, which
is a transversal academic\nintellectual project
across our departmental\nstructures,
called a sensory\nmedia platform, that
has been led by a\nnumber of our faculty,
including some of the faculty\nwho are here, like Silvia
Benedito and others.
And I think the\npurpose of that has
been to go beyond the\npurely visual dimension
by actually considering\nthe sonic-- the haptic.
And again, I feel that many of\nthe tracts of the MDes program
really consider\ntheir relationship
to the built environment in\na much broader sense that
actually connects very directly\nwith questions of memory,
history, temporality,\nas well as,
of course, the\nsonic dimension that
is so much part and parcel\nof what Janet has been doing.
And I think we're\nall in for a treat.
So would you please join me\nin welcoming Janet Cardiff.
[APPLAUSE]
- Thank you very much.
It's very encouraging to hear\nabout so much collaboration
between different sort of\nmedia and different practices,
because in Berlin,\nwhen we lived there,
that's one shock I got-- that\nwe would be invited by theater
directors, or by\nsymphonies, or architects
to work with and\ncollaborate with.
But it doesn't happen so\nmuch in North America.
And I think it's a\nreally good sign.
I think it just makes sense.
And naturally, I\nthink I've always been
drawn to that type of practice.
I wanted to show you a\ncouple of early works,
because I'm going\nto talk a little bit
about the collaborations\nbetween George and I. George
and I met in art school.
I was a graduate student.
He was a grade--
no, he wasn't in grade two.
He was in the second year.
So he wasn't that young.
But anyways, so he was a\npainter and I was a print maker.
But for some reason, even our\nfirst date we got together,
we started making\nworks together.
And it was like a recording of--
we went to a crazy concert,\nrecorded it, and then
put it in front of\nthe TV with the sound
off with a six-pack on the side.
So that was our\nfirst collaboration.
And then we started\nmaking films together.
But he helped me in my\npractice, and I helped him
in his practice.
And he was very much\ninto this idea of--
he started working on a lot of\nkinetic sculptures in the 90s.
We started officially\nworking together in '95,
but we actually were\ntogether in 1982.
So it's a very long time--
before some people were born.
And I want to show\nyou this piece,
because it has the elements\nthat keep reoccurring
in a lot of our\nworks, and this idea
that what we know of\ntechnology, we can't believe--
that there's magic involved.
And it doesn't take much\nto have our beings want
to be involved in that magic.
And he quit painting, because\nit was a modernist school.
And then he went into\na program in Toronto
that involved electronics.
And that was his natural forte.
We did Super 8 films.
We did lots of filmic work.
And so the whole sense\nof noir-ish films
and kinetic sculpture, and\nthen I started adding sound
into print, and then eventually\njust gave up the print making.
Because once I started working\nwith sound, I realized,
this is the medium for me.
It works in a way with memory\nthat nothing else works.
I mean, you're having\nto remember the sentence
that I said last, right?
And it sort of fades away.
But there's little pieces\nof it that come out.
And then something\nthat's important to you
isn't important to you.
I started working in this way\nwith walks and installations,
because I liked how the\nviewer or the listener
started adding\ntheir whole memory
bank to the actual piece.
So let's see.
I just want to show you\nhow this one functions.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[JUMPING]
It's actually\ncontrolled by a beep
that he triggered\nwhen he was jumping.
And his beeping on the\ntrigger made the TV move,
so then I filmed it\nwhile he was doing it.
And then I actually\ndid the Foley sound.
It's my footsteps that\nyou hear, because he
couldn't coordinate that.
But he did a whole series\nthis idea of aerodynamics,
and how video actually--
once you move the video, or\nonce you move the monitor,
it doesn't become a flat image--
a flat virtual space-- anymore.
It actually becomes\na physical space.
[END PLAYBACK]
And at the same time--\nthis is 1992 as well--
I was working on bare\nspeaker installations.
And we're really involved in\nthis idea of cubist narrative.
For some reason, I just loved\nany films that dealt with how
to--
it's hard to describe,\nbecause I have a sense of--
I see sound in waves.
And I always want to make\nthat sort of environment
for the viewer.
So I came to George\nwith an idea.
We had this old\ntable that we found.
And I loved how\nthere was the memory
of the marks in the table.
It was an old carpenter's table.
And I want to have\nsensors in the tables
and then have the\nsound come around.
And then I wrote script and\nthen I recorded sound effects--
took stuff from the TV,\ndid all sorts of things.
And so, of course,\nGeorge figured it out,
because he's really\ngood technically.
That's why we make\na good partner team.
Because I'm not anymore.
I used to be a bit.
But he's so good that I\njust let him do everything.
But I love experimenting\nwith ideas.
I'll give you a little.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
This shows a little\nbit of the soundtrack
and how it started to mix.
- You ain't gonna get\naway with it, kid.
- What do you want?
- I see you.
Hanging around him.
Making love to him.
Kissing him.
- Maybe I do like him.
That's none of your business.
- Picture this image.
A small bedroom at night.
Outside, you can hear\nthe wind in the trees.
A light shines onto the bed.
Roman--
[END PLAYBACK]
- So that's a really\nseminal work for me.
And it comes back in\nsome of our later works.
And today I'm\ngoing to show you--
I'm going to speed through\nsome, and pause on some--
but show you different thematics\nthat we've been working on.
Because there's so\nmany different ways
to come at a problem.
Like if you were trying to\nwork with sculptural sound,
then you can work\nwith ideas of speakers
around-- bare speakers-- or\nyou can work with audio walks.
I was experimenting in a\nresidency in Banff, 1991.
and also working\non the soundtrack
for the previous piece there.
And they had a\nSennheiser dummy head.
And I started\nexperimenting with it.
And then I was\nrecording walks, just
on a regular playback machine.
And I pushed the wrong\nbutton and ended up
hearing my voice talking\nand describing things
as if walking along.
And it was one of\nthose aha moments.
And I thought, this\nis really cool.
So I got my four-track out.
A four-track was\na cassette deck.
And it was a way of\nmixing four tracks.
It was really amazing back then.
And made the first\naudio walk that I did.
And I was really intrigued\nwith, when you listened
to it in the very same site--
and that's what's important\nabout the audio walks,
is, you're getting--
in this case, I gave a few\nfriends the cassette deck
and a headset.
And then they were\ngiven directions
to walk around a\nparticular forest.
And you'd hear\nvirtual people run by,
or hear fake birds and all that.
And I realized that I was\ncreating a film soundtrack
for the physical environment.
And that really\nintrigued me and how,
for every person that's\nwalking, it's a different piece.
And also, I could have\nthis surrogate relationship
with the viewers.
Because I didn't have to be\nthere and talking to them
and whispering in\ntheir ears and stuff.
But I could have this thing\nthat I just send them off with.
And I didn't even know\nif it was art back then.
And actually, I was kind of\nafraid to show it to anyone.
Because people really didn't--
it's surprising to think,\nbut 1991, in Canada--
luckily, there was a\ncurator, Kitty Scott,
who went, like, "Oh,\nthis is pretty neat."
And then she gave it\nto someone else who
was curating a show in Denmark.
And then it actually\nwent on from there.
And it ended up in\nMuenster, Germany.
But I started getting\ninvited all over the world
to do these projects.,\nand, I think, in 10 years,
to 20 different audio walks.
And how I record them is,\nwe go to a particular site--
George ended up editing them.
And I just want to\ntalk about technology
and how it's such\nan inspiration.
Because first, it\nwas a four-track.
And then it was\nreel-to-reel, we did a walk.
And that's really impossible.
Because you're working as\na visual artist invisibly--
having to work in a\nstudio and do a written
script when this sound goes\nup, when this sound goes up.
And then ProTools came out with\na computer that could actually
do it in 1996.
And it was really hard\nto do, like, eight tracks
and have the computer still run.
So that sort of thing\nmade a huge difference.
So I think a lot of\nour work actually got--
once the technology\ncame out, then we
were stimulated to do something.
So I haven't\ndescribed that these
are recorded with binaural.
That's a piece that was in\nCentral Park that's actually
still available online.
If you're in New York and want\nto do an audio walk in Central
Park, you can download some\nphotos and other things.
But this is a piece-- the\nlast audio walk that we did.
Because it started with a\nformat where we kind of got
bored with it.
I got bored with writing\nthe scripts for it.
We always like to push ourselves\nin every different piece we're
making.
Or actually, I really\nlike to learn from my art.
And it's surprising\nwhat you make.
I'm sure you all find\nthat here in a work
environment like this.
Because it taught me a lot\nabout ideas of virtual reality.
It taught me a lot about where\na body can be related in space.
Because what you do is, I walk\naround with this blue head.
And she's got two\nmicrophones in her ears.
And it records\nthree-dimensionally,
because it's the way we hear.
Because if I go like\nthis, the microphone
records it directly here.
But with this microphone, it\nrecords the sound bouncing
to that wall and back here.
It creates a\nthree-dimensional picture.
So when you're listening\nwith headphones,
it is a three-dimensional thing.
It's called binaural--\nbasically two ears,
two audio experiences.
So this is me directing\nthe invisible soldiers.
In every site, it's like\ncreating Foley sound.
You're creating environment.
These people are running by.
And it's so important to be\nright exactly on the spot.
Because you don't\nrealize how much
you know about sound when\nyou're listening to a situation.
Because if you listen to\nthis piece in this room,
it sounds like a recorded thing.
But when you're on location\nlistening to the sound that
was recorded maybe a month\nbefore, or two weeks before,
in the very same\nlocation, then there's
slightly different sounds--\nlike maybe a dog walks by
and it's not there in reality.
But you have this syncing up.
So you have the recorded space,\nyou have the physical space,
and then you have this third\nspace that creates a new world.
And that's what I was very\ninterested in, as well
as the textures.
This was the Louisiana\nmuseum in Denmark,
which is a wonderful museum.
It's one of the best\nmuseums, architecturally,
I think, for many generations.
I can't remember when it\nwas built. But the museum
itself actually has so many\ndifferent spaces for the viewer
to encounter, like low\nceilings high galleries,
underground galleries, ones\nwhere you see the outdoors.
And this was a George\n[INAUDIBLE] sculpture
that I walked on\nfrom the museum.
To me, textures\nare so important.
And the George\n[INAUDIBLE] sculpture
had a variety of textures,\nbecause you unconsciously
hear the footsteps.
And you know that\nyou're walking on metal
when you're walking there.
You know you're\nwalking on stone.
So it's funny, because\nit's just like when
I used to teach drawing, or\nwhen I took a pretty basic,
traditional BFA.
And so when you're drawing,\nyou think about textures.
You think about this, then.
It's the same with sound.
When you're looking\nat a location,
you're always thinking\nabout textures--
small space-- an alleyway--\nversus a big space.
So whenever George and I\nwere designing the walks,
we had to think about--
like this one.
It's still available, I think.
The building has\ntotally changed.
It used to start at the--
let's see.
There's part of it.
It used to start at the\nWhitechapel Public Library
and now it's the\nWhitechapel Gallery.
But I think they still\nwill let you do it.
And it starts off\nwith library sounds
and then you walk through.
But that was important.
This kind of space is kind of\nlike a Jack the Ripper space.
And then you end up in\nthe Liverpool station.
And then you go through\nall various things.
So your body totally\ngets a sense [INAUDIBLE].
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- Turn left at this corner.
[END PLAYBACK]
- So this is just a\nvery short sound excerpt
from the actual piece.
And this is in the East End\nof London around Brick Lane.
I don't know if any\nof you remember,
there was a series\nof bombings by--
I think he was a homophobic\nperson and terrorist, in ways.
And he was putting\nbombs in various places.
But bombed Brick\nLane like 10 minutes
after I walked by,\nbasically, recording.
But in this piece, we used\na lot of sound effects,
because London has\nsuch a history.
There's sounds you can\nbring from the war.
There sounds you can\nbring from the blitz.
And then there's car alarms.
There's this and that, from\nall different time periods.
Like we even took some\nhelicopters from Vietnam.
And I love how you can take\nall these different spaces
and put them together and\nthey create one new space.
Makes you think about\nso many different things
philosophically, about how\nwe exist within these spaces
and how we bring all\nthese spaces with us,
sound-wise-- acoustically.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- Turn left at this corner.
[END PLAYBACK]
- Sorry, one thing\nI wanted to say--
the sound you hear is the\nsound that she's hearing.
So you're not actually\nhearing the actual environment
that she's in.
You're hearing the\nrecorded audio.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- Turn left at this corner.
[FOOTSTEPS]
We're on Fashion Street now.
- The shopkeeper on Brick\nLane described her as tall,
with long red hair,\nand an American accent.
- This is the street\nthat I saw in the book--
the narrow lane with children\nwatching the camera--
only there was a lot of fog\nin the air, and cobblestones.
The book told the\nstory of a man who
lives in one of these houses.
[VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYS]
For 20 years, he\nsearched for the woman
he loved, waiting\nfor her to come back,
playing his violin in his room.
How can we just walk over their\nfootsteps and not remember?
There's a lime--
[PLAYBACK ENDS]
- Oh, she was going\nto say there's
a lime green car parked there.
One of the parts of the walks is\nthat we always look in the area
and find what is\nreoccurring all the time,
so that when people are\nlistening to recorded audio,
then they see the\nphysical reality
that lines up with that,\nthey know it's recorded.
So It gives it this\nsort of strange--
It sort of dislocates people.
But I have to hurry on\nhere to get to a few--
I want to get a few\nof these points,
because I think it's very\ninteresting how you learn
from your practice so much.
This lining up of the audio\nmade me think about, well,
what about photographs?
So the Central\nPark walk actually
used this idea of\nfound photographs.
And like Mohsen was saying about\nresearching the area in London,
I did tons of research\nand historical research
in this area.
And it would bring up\nparticular stories.
And I didn't actually--
I posed these photos,\nso they weren't real.
But most people thought they\nwere actually found photos.
Because I made them\nlook like 1970s photos.
And the idea that there's\nso many couples in the park,
and then brought out this story.
But it gave the idea of\nthe video telescopes.
And in this one--
I'll show a very short excerpt,\njust because it really--
it's hard to describe this\nwork, because it's very
much about being there at site.
So as we were talking\nearlier about documentation,
it's almost impossible.
But I think this gives a\nlittle bit of an indication.
By the way, this is the old SF\nMOMA, before the renovation.
Like this is 1999.
So now, the wall\nisn't even there.
First, they put a wall there.
There was no parking lot.
And then now, there's not\neven a street next door.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
So what's inside the telescope\nis actually a recorded video
on a [INAUDIBLE] camera\nthat was recorded--
the tracking was recorded.
- [INAUDIBLE] [END PLAYBACK]
- Sorry, I love her smile.
Sorry.
I have to wait for that.
But that gave us the\nidea that-- one day,
we were sitting having coffee,\nand I was just playing around
with one of these\nHi8 video recorders--
fancy thing-- and George got\nup and went in the kitchen,
and then I replayed the\nvideo and went, "This
is the same as a telescope.
Why not have the\npeople be the moving
around instead of the\ntelescopes moving around?"
So then we were invited to do\nan audio walk in Pittsburgh.
And I had said to\nMadeleine Grynsztejn,
the curator there, "Well, I have\nthis idea I\'d like to work on.
I don't know if it'll work.
We've never done one before.
But we want to do a video walk."
So we had to buy\nall these cameras
and had to sort of matrix story.
And then we did one\nin the Hebbel theater
in Berlin by a\ndirector who's asked
to do a couple of projects.
And it's really great,\nbecause they still
mount it occasionally,\nwhen the theater is empty.
But now it's on an\niPod or iPod Touch.
And it went backstage\nand everything.
And this is in Kassel for\ndocumenta-- the last documenta.
And it's in the train station.
And it's interesting\nwith historical stuff.
In Germany, you don't\nhave to show much at all,
because the history is so thick\nthere that if you show one
little thing-- this\nhappened to be--
just by chance, because\nwe like the site--
there were a couple of\nvarious interesting textures,
and lots of places\nto go, as well as,
you could see the video screen.
It wasn't too bright.
But also this was a\ntrain station in Kassel
where, on track 13,\nthey had shipped
Jewish people to the camps.
So one of the things\nwas to find where
that was and just show it.
And then there was a\ndance sequence and stuff.
It was a variety of things.
But we've worked\nand worked trying
to figure out how to show\ndocumentation of this.
And so George has got a green\nscreen and a little camera here
and it sort of works so you\ncan see a little bit of it.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- OK.
Turn the camera on.
Press the video button.
I'm sitting here\nright now with you
in the train station in Kassel\nwatching the people pass by.
It's very intimate in\nways, watching people.
You can see how\nthey walk, so you
can tell if they're happy\nor sad or lost somewhere
in their mind.
[FOOTSTEPS]
This video will\nbe an experiment.
We're like those prisoners\nstuck in Plato's cave.
They watch the flickering\nshadows on the screen.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Try to allign your\nmovements with mine.
Move your screen up\nto the left as I do.
A red coat.
I used to have one.
Wonder where it went.
So many people wear black here.
Garbage pails have moved.
Do you see the musicians?
They're between the pillars now.
Let's get up.
Follow them.
And turn to the right.
Try to follow the image.
Now stop and watch.
[DOG BARKING]
[CHATTER]
Let's continue.
[END PLAYBACK]
- That was one of\nthose happy accidents.
Oops.
So that's where they start.
They're always has to\nbe a hand-out system.
And then there's a couple\nof guys waiting behind.
And it's important to me that\nthey actually go individually,
so you don't have that sense\nthat you're in a crowd.
So the ergonomics of the\npiece is part of the piece.
And the people that hand it out\nare always part of the piece.
I just want to show you this.
George has a Steadicam at the\nback and a cinematographer
we're working with there.
And then these are the\nfake crew that were
photographing the ballerina.
And it was minus 20 in this\ntrain station that day.
And that poor\nballerina would do this
and then she'd run off\nand get her coat on.
It was so cold to\ndo this production.
Germany had a very cold spell.
So now I'm going to\nskip to-- that was 2012.
But I wanted to show you--
I won't show you much\nvideo of this at all,
but we were trying\nto figure out how
to use this binaural within a\nsort of theatrical situation,
so that you'd put on\nthe headset and go In.
This is a piece\nthat's one person,
and it's a five\nminute long piece.
It was a disaster at\nopenings because there
were such huge lineups.
But it was a sort\nof a Hitchcock--
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- Shh, it's going to start.
- --thing of a little opera--
[APPLAUSE]
--singer that we had a\nlittle video production of.
And it\'s called "Playhouse,"\nbecause everything\'s
made of cardboard.
[OPERA MUSIC]
[END PLAYBACK]
You couldn't tell from that,\nbut maybe from this one.
This was the one we\nthought, "Oh, it\'s great.
It\'s like three\npeople at a time."
And when it first--\nit actually showed
at the Tate Modern\nopening, and people
we're grabbing them off other\npeople's heads, the headphones.
So that didn't work very well.
And I don't know if\nyou can see here,
but it's actually an\narchitectural model that's
in 3D perspective, so that\nthe little seats at the front
are very tiny, and then they\ngot bigger as you went back.
And then George and I made this\nfilm, and it breaks at the end,
and there's a shooting\nin the theater, which
was very kind of prescient.
And it's kind of\na film noir film.
And then we were invited\nto the Venice Biennale.
And we thought, well,\nwe'll make a bigger piece.
The Canadian pavilion\nis like the tool
shed between the British\nand the German pavilion.
And it's that shape.
So we basically made a structure\nthat would fit into it.
And then it's a bigger theater.
But we really pushed the\nwhole idea of the Cubist space
here, and cubist\nnarrative and cubist film,
so that this piece starts\nwith the sound all around you.
And then it goes into the film.
And then a character\ncomes forward.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- Shh.
It's starting.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- Like we recorded within\nthe box, with a head--
[FOOTSTEPS]
--and then bringing\nin other sounds
we recorded in an\nempty apartment
room, and another singer.
And then--
- I heard a man pass by\nunder my window last night.
I listened to his footsteps as\nthey faded into the distance.
Only the second\nperson this month.
How long have I been here?
[THUNDER]
- It's time to wake up now.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
[ZIPPER ZIPS]
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[END PLAYBACK]
That's That's actually Carolyn\nKristof answering her phone
in the physical sculpture.
But we'd made a\nfilm, and then we
recorded it regular\nwith a boom mic.
And then we rerecorded\nin the Delphi Theater.
And whenever you listen to\nit in the actual artwork,
it sounds like you're\nin a big theater,
because it's recorded\nwith binaural there.
But there's a plane\nthat goes over.
So in Venice, you thought\nthere was a plane going over.
But it was actually in\nBerlin that was going over.
Do you understand what I mean?
It's kind of hard to explain\nbecause it's a difficult medium
to show.
This one was a fun one because--
oh, Volker Spangler, who's\nacted in 14 Fassbinder films.
He's an amazing brain--\namazing character.
And then at the end, we\nactually burned down a house.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[HOUSE BURNING]
[END PLAYBACK]
I phoned up my dad\nand said, "Have you
taken down that house yet\nthat\'s on your extra property?"
He goes, "No."
"Can I burn it down?"
He said, "Sure."
So we got the local\nfire department.
And that's how those seats--
that's a problem\nwith the binaural,
you have to have headphones.
So this was another\naspect of our work
is, we worked with\ntotally bare speakers
and worked with complete sound.
And the very same year that\nwe did The Paradise Institute
at Venice and also moved to\nBerlin, we produced this piece.
And it all came about\nbecause some singer I'd hired
recognized I really loved\na three-dimensional sound.
And so she was like, "Have\nyou heard Spem in Alium
by Thomas Tallis?"
I said, "I don\'t know.
I can\'t remember."
And so when I listened\nto it on two speakers,
I went, "This is just crazy.
I want to hear it\nin 40 speakers."
And sometimes we get lucky.
Because I said to\nGeorge, "We can do this.
It'd be easy.
Just have 40 CD players."
And he goes, "No.
That won't work.
Because if they're slightly out\nof phase, it'll just go, like,
tch-tch-tch--
they'll have this phasing sound.
And so right at\nthe moment, Tascam
put out 24-output machines.
And nobody had those before.
And so we were able to actually\nput those together and sync up
40 tracks of separate sound\nand record 40 singers--
actually there were 60 singers,\nbecause there's three kids
for every soprano voice.
And we recorded it\nin a dead space,
so that whenever we take this\npiece-- and it's showing all--
I call it "the Eveready bunny"\nbecause it just goes everywhere
and never wears out.
But it has to be tuned for\nevery particular space.
I have a tonmeister I work with.
And this is a reconstructed\nchapel within the National
Museum in Canada.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- Twenty.
- And this is--
- The last bar\nand the first bar.
And then that first one.
- Yeah.
[END PLAYBACK]
- So we recorded even\nwhile the singers were just
taking a break.
And then--
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- I'm doing it there.
That's me.
- To give them that sense\nof actual people coming out.
[CHOIR SINGING]
[END PLAYBACK]
That's all I'll play, because\nit's really hard for me
to hear it on two\nspeakers, because I'm
used to hearing it on 40.
And it sounds way better on 40.
But it's shown a lot\nof different spaces.
And I've learned a lot\nabout acoustics and a lot
about museums.
And we were talking about\nideas of how the sound systems
in museums--
the curators say, "Yeah,\nit\'s a really quiet space.
It\'s great."
And we go there and go\nlike, "What\'s that buzz?"
Or, "What\'s that whoosh sound?"
Or a [HUMS].
So we have our tonmeister go\nto every particular space,
make sure, acoustically,\nit sounds good.
You know, the funniest\nthing is, some of the--
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant\nto turn that off.
It's supposed to be off.
Oh no.
[INAUDIBLE]
Some of the most\nbeautiful spaces
actually sound the worst.
Like, the worst is\nglass and cement.
We discovered that you can't\nshow in any carpeted spaces.
You can't show in--
sometimes they have\nweird spaces like this.
This was a terrible space.
It was visually beautiful\nand kind of spooky,
but it was very\nhard acoustically.
This was a very difficult space.
It was the first piece\nthat had shown there
after they took down the\nbig Kiefers at the Hamburger
Bahnhof in Berlin.
So what you can see on the\nside, there's hanging curtains.
So we hung curtains this\nfar out from the wall
all through the entire space.
A very thin piece\nof material, but it
was enough to stop the echoes.
Because this piece,\nThe Murder of Crows--
we decided that we wanted--
it was a big jump between\nForty-Part Motet in 2001
to this one in 2008.
But we kept thinking\nwe wanted to make
a piece that was the same\nkind of physical audio sound.
We had Russian choirs in it.
And we wanted to make\nsort of a film soundtrack
without much narrative.
And it's got big wave surf.
It's got this huge\namount of sound.
And it's usually shown in\nabout a 70-meter long space.
So it's shown in a lot of\ndifferent amazing spaces.
And one of the themes behind\nthe piece is the Goya--
you know the Goya\netching, The Sleep
of Reason Brings\nImpossible Monsters--
is that what it's called?
Yeah.
Anyways, this idea\nof the nightmare--
it was actually\nafter the Iraq War
and reading the Herald\nInternational Tribune
all the time and reading\nabout the victims
of the American bombs.
And one story I\nread was a father
coming back and finding\nhis daughter's arms
hanging on the chandelier.
And so it created a\nwhole-- this is also
an opera within this piece.
As well as, we were in\nNepal for-- this is it
at the Armory in New York.
It was a wonderful space\nbecause it's all wooden floors.
And we needed a dead space\nthat you could actually
see the sound move around.
If you have too much\nreverberatory space, then
the sound just mixes\ntogether and you can't really
tell where anything is.
But it was very important to\nus to be able to see the sound.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- He brings him in, sort\nof dragging him, saying,
"He decided he\'d run for\nit, but I caught him."
And you can see that one of\nthe kid's feet-- his foot
was [INAUDIBLE] swollen up.
His toes were all\nbig and purple.
He\'s crying, looking at us,\nsaying, "Please, help me.
Please."
[END PLAYBACK]
So I was in Nepal\nfor six months,
and I started having\nvery nightmarish dreams.
And so I started recording them.
And so this piece uses\nthree different dreams
as a structure.
And they're all\nvery bizarre dreams.
But then we made sounds\nthat sort of go with it,
and had a composer in\nBerlin work with us on it.
Then in Kassel-- we had to\ncreate this sort of structure
with narrative for\nthe last piece,
because we found that\npeople couldn't-- or we
couldn't-- remember--\nit's a 30-minute piece.
And we couldn't really put\ntogether in a very nice way,
aesthetically, the sounds\nfrom the beginning to the end
to the middle.
So we had to sort of join\nit up with a kind of a sense
of narrative to bring together.
But with this piece in the\nforest, we were able to do it,
because you had this--
the content was a forest.
And I'll play you a little\nexcerpt just so you can see.
There's 24 speakers\nrecorded in Surround Sound.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
And so half the time you don't\nknow what's real in the forest.
And it's called A\nShort History, in ways,
because it brings in-- we went\nto reconstructions of, say,
like, a Napoleonic War--
[LAUGHING]
--where they shot muskets\nand recorded that.
And we went to bomb sites\nwhere they're blowing up things
and recorded that.
We had students in the\nuniversity near where
we lived go out into the\nforest and laugh for us
and recorded in this\ntechnique called ambisonic.
[END PLAYBACK]
So that's a piece--
a lot of these videos\nare on our YouTube,
or on a Cardiff-Miller site\nif you want to see more.
I just don't have\nthe time today.
Because I want to get into\na certain amount of themes.
Because what we\nstarted discovering
was that these\npieces of equipment
had a sense of\nanthropomorphic quality--
that they became so\nphysical that you started--
like people, with Motet,\nwould walk up to them.
And they'd feel comfortable\nwalking up to it.
But every speaker was a singer.
So I knew sort of who\nthat singer was, and I'd
recorded it.
I remember it because\nI'd been there recording.
But it became very\ninteresting to me
how much personality a speaker\nor an amplifier could have.
I think this was 2003, just\nwhen Bush went into Iraq.
We had a reproduction\ndone of Jimi Hendrix.
We had it scored, and then\na really amazing guitarist
play it with all the\nfeedback and everything.
So when you step\non the pedal, you
get the same kind of Jimi\nHendrix feedback song.
Does everybody know--\nno, you probably don't.
Jimi Hendrix played the\nStar Spangled Banner
with tons of feedback,\nagainst the Vietnam War,
basically, as a protest.
And so we were using it\nin the same kind of way,
as a protest in ways.
It's a very loud piece.
This is one of my\nfavorite pieces.
It's a very simple piece.
We found a set of\nslides in our basement
that actually had been\nGeorge's grandfather
crossing the country.
And I just wanted to\ntalk about this a bit,
because it's about transversing\nthrough someone else's pictures
a whole landscape.
And he never met\nhis grandfather,
but it came out that his\ngrandfather, on this trip,
was going from out west--
Calgary-- and then went\na bit into BC, and then
through the States\nto New York City,
where there was a\ndoctor he was going
to be meeting for his cancer,\nwhich actually didn't cure him.
But this set of slides ended\nup being the story of it.
But when we were looking\nat it, I set them up,
and then we set up\na recording head,
and George and I sat and talked.
And we reproduced it by having\nGeorge's voice coming out
one side and my voice\ncoming out another.
And this piece had been\nintentioned to be just
a part of a big installation.
And then when we\nactually replayed it,
we realized we had\nsomething interesting.
Because what happens is,\nit looks like the voices
are controlling--
there's some slides of\nNew York at the end.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[PROJECTOR SHUFFLES]
It looks like the projector\nis being controlled
by the voices, which is--
- Oh, I this-- this\nis Lake Superior.
- Yeah, this one looks\nlike Lake Superior.
So it's just out of order.
- Yeah, but this--
- Because this is\nback in the mountains.
One of the elk.
- [INAUDIBLE]
- And then this must\nbe when he was hiking,
because the mountain\nshape earlier--
- Why would he have\nthat one out of order?
- I don't know.
- Because now we're\nback in the mountains.
Doesn't make sense.
It should go from the mountains\nto Calgary to the prairies.
- This is sort of prairie.
- This looks like\nNorthern Ontario to me.
Because it's kind of\na swampy wasteland
- No, this is definitely\na prairie shot, though.
- This is badly organized.
[END PLAYBACK]
- So anyways, I wanted\nto show that just as--
it was a way to do almost like\na portrait of a collaboration--
a couple.
And then we did another kind\nof portrait series, where
we're talking about a film, and\nthen we had two composers doing
soundtracks--
composing, as we\nsort of described
the film, a piece on\nthe piano, and then we
had a piano player play it back.
So you hear George and I\ndescribing this weird sci-fi
alien zombie film, and then\nthe piano player plays it.
But we did a few musical\ninstruments like this.
And then this was\nactually our first--
this is another kind of\nseries that we work in,
is almost theatrical Baroque.
And it's called The Dark Pool.
And it's in permanent\ninstallation in Dusseldorf
at K21, if you're\never in Dusseldorf.
But it became our first\nofficial collaboration,
because we couldn't\nremember whose idea it was.
And we're just kind of echoing\nhow messy our studio was.
And we kind of enjoyed that.
So we just started adding things\nto it, and then adding sound,
so it's censored sound\nas you walk around.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[DOOR CREAKS]
[END PLAYBACK]
And then this is another piece\nin the genre, 10 years later,
called Opera For a Small Room.
And we had the title about four\nyears before we did the piece,
because we liked that title.
And then we decided\nto create a situation
where the record players were\nbeing played by the speaker.
So it's kind of magical.
Because at one point, the record\nskips, and then the shadow
moves in the room.
And it fixes the record player.
And another point where\nthere's surround sound outside,
and a train goes by, and\nthe chandelier shakes.
So it's all kind of\nthese stage effects.
This is also kind of a reference\nto Krapp's Last Tape, which has
always been an amazing play--
a Samuel Beckett play--
and I've always\nreally enjoyed that.
And then the lighting\nchanges, and at the end,
it becomes a rock opera.
So it's actually a sad piece.
It's a 20-minute piece.
It's all about a\nman whose wife left,
and something\nhappened on the road.
There was maybe an accident.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- In the middle of the stage--
- This is the beginning.
- --a man sits alone in a\nroom, surrounded by speakers,
turntables, and records.
[MUSIC PLAYS FROM RECORD]
She was walking down the road.
She was walking down the road\nwith her shoes in her hand.
Where the fuck was she going?
- Then he sings along.
[MAN SINGS ALONG WITH RECORD]
So it's kind of\na funny portrait.
But at one point, all\neight record players
are playing opera\nsongs together.
It's just a crazy\ncacophony of opera.
And then this is another piece.
This came out right after all\nthe photos of Abu Gharib--
you know, the torture photos\nthat hit all over the world,
and the horrendous activities\nthat were going on there.
And at the same time, I\nwas reading Kafka again,
and read that in\nthe penal colony--
and it's about\nconceptual killing
through bureaucratic\npunishment and killing.
So we decided to create\na killing machine
that, you walk in and\nyou press the button
and it turns on the piece.
And it's a five-minute piece.
And at first we thought we'd\nhave, like, eight robots,
and they'd be all dancing.
And then we realized that\nrobots were too hard to make
and too hard to program.
So we ended up with two.
And then it changes\nthe lighting,
the dentist chair\nchanges up and down,
and it's got this\nweird fun fur on it
that looks like it's kind\nof the color of blood.
And then a guitar gets hit.
There's different parts to it.
This series that we\nwork on is very much
a reference to theater.
It's kind of a hybrid between\ntheater and performance art
and between visual art.
I'll just show you a little bit,\njust until you get the idea.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[MACHINES WHIRRING]
- Your left thumb [INAUDIBLE]
[END PLAYBACK]
- It's weird how they're very\nmuch like a lot of the sci-fi
movies from the 90s and 2000s--
these robots moving\naround the field--
like The Terminator.
And then at the end, of\ncourse, there's a mirrorball.
This is one of the\nmusical pieces we made--
a collection of our sound files.
When you open the drawer,\nyou hear a little bit.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- The furnace.
[END PLAYBACK]
It's just a couple more\npieces I want to show,
and then I think\nI'll wrap it up.
This one's over the top, but--
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[END PLAYBACK]
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Now, this piece, we decided to\nexperiment in F-sharp minor.
So we invited quite a few\nmusicians into the studio,
and said, "OK, why don\'t you\ngo with this click track,
and then play, doodle\naround, whatever you
want to do in F-sharp minor?"
And then we mixed\nit all together so
that we have 70-some speakers\nhere, I think-- bare speakers.
And I think there's four\npiano elements coming out.
And then there's a rock drum\nsection and guitar in one area.
But we had them record\nfor a loop of about two
and a half minutes, so\nthat the piece is mixed--
sorry, I didn't\ntell you-- there's
sensors around the table.
There is, I think, five\nsensors in each side,
so that as you walk around,\nyour shadow turns it on.
So if there's one\nperson in the room,
you'll only hear a little bit.
And as you walk\naround the room--
or if there's a couple\npeople, you'll hear a lot.
And each sensor, once\nyou move away from it,
stays on for six seconds.
So it mixes with\nthe other sounds,
but it doesn't stay on\nunless you're there with it.
And then we had a little bit\nof sound effects, but mostly,
it's--
let me see if I have some\nrock-n-roll up at the end.
So if you move fast\naround it, you can--
so basically, it's\nkind of like a DJ.
You can play it like a DJ table,\nalmost, or something like that.
Kind of a conceptual instrument.
And this was one of the crazy\npieces that we've last made.
It is called The\nMarionette Maker.
We've done a few pieces with\nmarionettes and this idea
of this little\nperson who you endow
with emotions and feelings,\nbecause they move.
But this isn't me lying there.
It's actually a\nsilicone replica of me.
We went to a\ncompany in Vancouver
that does all sorts of\nstuff for Hollywood,
and making bodies with\nheads that fall off
and stuff like that.
And they cast me.
And there's George.
He's playing his guitar.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
And there's a variety\nof all sorts of--
I have a room in my\nstudio that's called--
my daughter calls it\n"toy torture area,"
where I take apart toys\nand mix them with things.
I've learned a lot\nthrough the idea of play
with art, that\nit's so important.
And this piece, I\nthink, is also inspired
by the Calder circus,\nwhich I think is
one of my favorite pieces ever.
We had a percussionist\ncome in and recorded them.
There's a little opera\nsinger with the piano player.
This is the marionette maker.
He's sort of designing it all.
The story is kind of,\nmaybe, that she's sleeping
but she never wakes up.
She just ages.
But he's sitting there\nmaking marionettes
as he's waiting\nfor her to wake up.
[END PLAYBACK]
And then this is a piece\nthat came afterwards,
because the piano player\nwanted another role.
And so that little\npiano player, actually--
I don't know if this\nfootage shows it very much,
but he plays the whole piece--
the sad waltz and the\ndancer who couldn't dance.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[MACHINES WHIRRING]
This was shown in the\nIstanbul Biennale.
Carolyn Kristof [INAUDIBLE]\ninvited us, with a theme of--
and so--
[MUSIC PLAYING]
The composition's by an\nArmenian composer, actually.
But the way we found it is\nwe just wanted a sad waltz.
And we looked on the\ninternet for a sad waltz,
and this is what came up.
And we love the music, so I\nbuilt a little marionette.
I find it a very sad piece.
Because of the way\nshe's controlled.
Even though she's this big, she\nstill becomes a little human.
[END PLAYBACK]
And this is the last piece.
And we can even just\nplay while we talk.
But it was made for--
they have a building\nat the Menil in Houston
that they had a reproduction\nof the Byzantine chapel
from Greece, and\nthen it was empty.
So now it's going to\nbe their project space.
But we were the first in there.
And it's basically\na big black box.
It was very tall.
So we just decided\nto make a big mobile.
And we couldn't figure out\nwhat we wanted to work with.
We tried hanging a\nwhole bunch of things.
But everything we\nhung had meaning.
And then-- I shouldn't say this,\nbut George was in the bathtub,
and he says, "Jan,\nwhat about mirrors?"
I said, "Yeah, that\'s great."
Because mirrors\nhave this sense of--
we found all these\nantique mirrors,
and you think about\nhow they've been
looked into by so many people,\nand where they've come from.
People from all over the world\nhave traveled as immigrants
and brought their mirrors.
And then the\nsoundtrack is actually
recordings from outer\nspace from NASA.
And we have it on\na program that's
a random program that changes\nthe lighting and the sound,
so that sometimes the\nsound of going past Saturn
and then sometimes the sound of\npast Earth or one of the moons.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[LOUD HUMMING]
And then sometimes\nthe lighting changes.
But we can just turn\nthe audio down a bit.
This piece has to have a\nvery high space to show in.
So there's not many\nspaces it can show.
But there's a\ncathedral in Amsterdam
that wants us to do\na piece, so we're
thinking of maybe\nmaking it a bit bigger
and showing it there.
Might be really nice.
I'm sure some of the mirrors\nalready came from Amsterdam.
It's called The\nInfinity Machine,
because in the\ncenter of the piece,
there's a couple mirrors\nfacing each other.
So I think that's the last\npiece I'm going to show.
So I think we're going\nto have a few questions.
But thank you very much.
[APPLAUSE]
And that was the speed version.
- Very good, very\ngood, very good.
Can we turn the\nlights on, maybe,
so that we can actually\nsee you, and maybe
turn the sound down a bit?
Thank you.
So one thing, for those\nof you who are new,
is that, at the end\nof the lectures,
we have some questions.
And even though you\nhaven't rehearsed this,
it would be great\nif we could invite
you to ask Janet some questions\nabout what she presented--
- I have a question.
- Where are you?
- Right here.
- OK.
Hello.
Hi.
- Hi.
Thank you.
That was so delightful.
And I just want to add\nthat it was particularly
delightful to hear you\ndescribe some of the works
that I've experienced before--
speaking of memory.
And part of that is that I also\nlove learning from your work.
And it's your facility\nwith layering,
and yet the fullness\nof experience
that results in that--
the fullness of all the\noperations through the body.
So the first question\nI have is about spaces
that are bad for sound, and if\nyou could describe that more,
because that, to me, sounds\nlike a frontier of work--
that there is no space\nthat is bad for sound,
but you have to learn how to\nchoreograph and how to operate.
And the second\nquestion is about--
- Do you mean interior spaces,\nor, like, natural spaces?
- You described, I think--\nthey were interior spaces--
some of the spaces that you\npointed out that were bad
for sound.
But maybe there were\nsome that I missed.
And the second question is,\nhow high do these mirrors
have to be hung?
Because I have a great idea\nfor where they could go.
- I forget how high\nit is, actually.
But it's about this high.
Yeah, it's about this high.
- It's about eight meters.
- About eight meters, yeah.
But with sounds in space--
it's interesting\nhow we get invited
to some of these spaces--
like, even with\nlandscape architects.
We've been invited\nto do a few projects,
and we will generally find it a\nbit difficult. Because usually,
landscape architects get to\nwork around, say, harbor fronts,
or something like\nthat, where they
want the space re-activated.
But it's already a busy\nspace, and there's usually
a highway next to it.
So we've never actually\ncompleted a project
with any of the projects there.
But the last one\nwe were invited to
was described as this\nnice, little, old alcove
of very ancient olive trees.
And we get there and there's\na highway right next to it.
And we're going, like, you\ncan't do the speaker piece here.
Because you're constantly\nthinking about the traffic
going by and you can't.
So it's really hard with spaces.
For Motet, natural\nlight is really nice.
And the best space I\nthink it's ever shown
is the Cloisters\nin New York City.
It showed at four different\nplaces in New York City,
including the MOMA in PS1.
And p.s.
PS1 was nice, because\nthere's a wall
of windows all the way around.
So as you're listening,\nyou're looking at the city.
And the strange thing\nwas that it actually--
we had a show booked to go\nto New York right as 9/11
happened--
for PS1.
And so the Motet was there.
And we didn't think the\nshow would actually get
through customs, but it did.
And it was mounted so\nthat people could stand
there and look at the city.
And it was just one of\nthese emotive things.
So I think, yeah, natural\nlight is really good.
But the hardest materials\nare the hardest.
And the Cloisters was so\ngood, because churches
are designed for singers.
They're designed to have\nthe voices go up to heaven
and become angels.
So the stone has\nall these pockmarks.
And so acoustically,\nthat's fantastic.
Because you can\nstill hear someone
talking 10 feet away from you.
But start thinking about,\nwhen you're going around
to different buildings, and\nseeing if you and your friend
can hear each other\nfrom three yards away.
But I think your body\ntakes in everything
about a space unconsciously.
So it's really amazing\nwhat you guys are doing.
So it's a very hard\nproblem, though, too,
working with materials,\nbut at the same time
being sensitive to how it is.
Because even a sense of\nthe rawness of the brick
here, and--
actually, I'm not\ngoing to go into this,
because that's your specialty.
Thank you for the question.
- Thank you.
So to the extent that\nyou're comfortable,
I was wondering if you could\ntalk about your relationship
with your partner,\nand how and if
you create a separation in your\nlife between your work and--
- That that's an\ninteresting question.
Because not many artists who are\nalso married can work together.
But it just started\nout really easily.
And he's not a man with a lot\nof ego, which really helped,
because for a while he\ngave up his practice
to edit my audio\nwalks, because it
became very busy with\naudio walks for awhile.
But he wouldn't even\ntake credit for them.
Now do everything.
But I think if you\nwork as a team--
I think it helps I grew\nup in a farm, and the idea
that everybody\nhas to contribute.
And you just sort of help\nout and it seems to work.
But when we cook dinner--
I like the sort of metaphor\nof working together
is like making a meal together,\nbecause I somehow just
automatically go do this,\nand then he does this.
And somehow we just\nwork around each other.
And we don't talk\nabout it too much.
I'm not very good technically.
And I've become, as I\nmentioned, less and less so.
Because he has\nthis kind of genius
to be able to see any\nproblem and to want
to fix it or figure it out.
Like if he needs to\nlearn to program for it,
he'll learn to program\nfor it, whereas I'd just
go, "Oh, I\'m just\ngoing to hire somebody
for that," or something.
Or, "How do I do this, George?,"\nand he\'ll figure it out.
But when either of us\ncomes up with an idea,
it's really good,\nbecause you still
have to watch how you\nrespond to that idea.
Like, you can\'t say, like,\n"Oh, that is so goofy.
How could you ever\nthink of that?"
Or like, "That is, like, blech."
You might think\nthat, but you have
to still watch saying,\n"Well, I don\'t think so."
But we're pretty\nblunt with each other.
And he's an editor that I trust.
Like I've written some\nreally bad script.
And sometimes it gets past him.
But usually he goes\nand crosses it out.
I have this whole\ncollection of post-it notes
I came across that\'s\nlike, "This is so corny.
You can\'t write this."
That sort of thing.
Maybe I'm telling too much.
- Do you see your relationship\nas an undercurrent
in any of your work?
Or have you taken\nthat on as the subject
of any particular piece?
- Well, the road trip\nthat I showed you,
I ended up editing the audio.
Because we had all this raw\naudio of us talking about these
slides and how I'd put\nthem in the wrong order
and everything like that.
So I edited out parts\nthat made me sound bad.
But that's the only\npiece, I think,
that's really become\nabout us, in terms
of showing how we work together,\nand how we relate, and saying,
he is a different\ntype of thinker.
For the Venice piece,\nwhen we were editing that,
I did a lot of rough cuts.
Like, I'll throw\nthings together.
And then he'll do\nthe fine tuning.
But then he's a really,\nreally good editor.
So then he'll find things.
And then I'll say,\nwell, what about this?
So we seem to really bounce.
We're really different.
And he works kind\nof night shift,
and I work morning shift.
So we have enough time separate\nthat when we come together,
it actually works.
And we both really\ntrust each other.
He doesn't like\ngoing to museums.
He doesn't like looking at art.
He likes going to\ndance performances.
But I love going to museums\nand looking at old paintings
or looking at whatever.
We both love reading.
And I think a lot of this\nstuff comes from reading.
But I don't know\nreally why it works.
But we also have a very\nstrong relationship.
And we were, like, 20 and 23\nwhen we got together, so we've
sort of grown together.
- Hi--
- Not that it's all just roses.
- Hi, thank you for the talk.
I thought it was really--
oh, sorry.
- Hi
- Hello.
First, I want to\nsay how disarming it
is to hear your voice\nin person, because it's
such a thread through\nthe work, this kind
of calm, sensible,\nyet commanding voice.
But I'm wondering, what's\ninteresting about experiencing
your work often is, sometimes\nyou disperse the audience,
or you isolate an audience\nmember, or unify them.
Like, some of your\nwork, one feels
very antagonized by other\nmembers of the audience.
And other times, you\nfeel very unified.
Like with Forty-Part\nMotet at the Cloisters,
people were crying.
It becomes a very kind\nof powerful experience.
So I'm wondering how you\nstrategize towards an intended
audience, or respond\nto how an audience is
engaging with your work?
- Can you expand a\nlittle bit more on that?
- Given how active I found the\nother members of the audience
to be in terms of your work,\nlike Opera For a Small Room,
or I remember seeing\nKilling Machine in Miami,
and everyone was just\nlike, "What do we do?
We pressed the button\nand now we're fucked.
How do we deal with that?"
But I don't know how\nyou would predict
that, or a set of\nresponses by the audience,
as you're kind of constructing\nor imagining the work.
And I'm wondering how maybe\nan audience response would
shape the work or\nguide your sensibility
towards other works.
- Well with the\nwalks, they're quite
different than\nthe installations.
Because it's really essential\nthat we don't frustrate people
too much and lose them.
So we always have test cases.
We do the rough edit first, and\nthen we get a few test cases.
Different people.
Some curators, some\nwriters, some artists.
Because artists are much better\nat finding their ways around
than writers or curators.
But if people end up walking--
when I record, sometimes,\nI record on site.
But other times-- I'm always\nrecording the footsteps
on site.
And I tend to walk with shorter\nfootsteps than someone who's
listening.
So then there's all this\nwhole ergonomic of--
George actually goes\non site with his laptop
now, and edits while listening\nto it, so that most times,
you have to take out\nabout 10 footsteps.
Because as you're walking,\nyou're hearing my breathing,
and you're hearing\nthe footsteps.
And it's so much\npart of the piece
that the audience\nand the sound are me,
kind of like a virtual me mix.
And so that you don't want\nto have them always way lost,
or not thinking syncing up\nwith when there's a building
that I say, "Oh, look\nat that cement wall.
It\'s got a big hole\nin it," or something.
And it's nice they share.
Because I think it's about this\nsense of intimacy and sharing.
When I first started\ndoing the audio walks,
there was a lot of dialogue\nabout how the Walkman was
alienating people, which\nis kind of funny dialogue
now with all the\niPhones and iPods.
And then when we\ndid the audio walks,
we realized that\npeople would come back
and they'd say, oh, I\nsee way more doing this
than I ever saw.
So it wasn't\ncanceling the vision.
But it was also making them feel\nreally intimate with somebody
and sharing with\nsomebody, which I thought
was kind of interesting.
So, did I answer that enough?
- Yeah.
Sure.
Thank you.
- It's a complex question,\nbecause the audience
is very important for\na lot of the works.
- Hello.
I think that was a\nreally great lecture.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
What I'm interested to hear from\nyou is how you relate yourself
in the early walks\nyou were doing
to marionette in the later ones.
Because I find it\ninteresting how you earlier
described with\nthe first question
that your body reacts to\nthe environment, but yet,
in the walks, the\npeople listening to it
are disembodied in yourself.
And then when watching\nthe performance
pieces and the theatrical\npieces at the end,
you're almost embodying the\nmarionette as an emotion,
and how you can kind\nof relate those two
parts of your project.
- Well, I've never\nthought about that.
That's a very\ninteresting thought.
Thank you.
Yeah.
The walks-- the funny thing is,\ntoo, when I first started them,
there were some dialogue\nabout power and control.
And then some people--
there was actually one\ncritic that wrote, "Well,
I don't like this\nsense of control--
being told where to go. 'Turn\nleft here,' and, 'Turn right
there,\' like a marionette."
And some of the walks-- like,\nthe Carnegie one was actually
based on this idea\nof the voice--
I had a Matrix character--
before The Matrix-- come on.
And he was like a scientist\ntreating the people
like they were\nwalking within a maze,
so that they were like mice.
So there is that kind\nof weird conflict
between being controlled by\nthe marionette maker, who
is myself and George.
So-- where was I\ngoing with that?
Shit.
Maybe you can add to this.
I had a really good point I\nwas trying to go for there.
It's kind of like that game as\na kid, when you're blindfolded
and you're led around.
There's a certain-- it's\nnot an S&M kind of thing,
but it's a certain kind\nof giving up your power.
It's enjoyable to\ngive up your power
and get into this idea of play.
So there were some people\nthat had a problem with it,
but most people liked to be led,\nand like to get into this idea
that it is play,\nand like to line up.
And also, what I've\nfound is, I was
surprised that so many\npeople liked to behave.
They really want to line up\nand make sure everything works.
And that's why there's--\nin The Playhouse--
and I think you saw The\nPlayhouse, didn't you?
In Miami.
There's one point where\nthe audience around you--
which I recorded\nin a lecture hall
when I gave a lecture once--
they start to laugh\nat the singer.
And people said that made\nthem so uncomfortable,
because, you know, you're\nnot supposed to do that.
So we do play with\ndifferent things that
do make people feel\nvery uncomfortable,
and sometimes, too,\neven the intimacy.
Like with my voice, I keep\nit so it's very neutral.
So it sort of just goes into\nyou, like thoughts, hopefully--
especially with women, more so.
But there is a sense\nof intimacy there
that can get a little creepy.
So it's a hard\nthing to work with.
So I think that's a very\ninteresting comment you made.
- Janet, thank you so much.
You know, what I think\nis so apt in terms
of your presentation\nand seeing the work,
and then hearing you talk\nabout it, in a way, is--
and I think it's so relevant\nin the context of the school--
is that, constantly,\npeople are dealing with
the inter-relationship\nbetween creativity--
like having some\ninteresting ideas--
and the implementation of\nthat, through the concept
of preparation.
A lot of the things that\nyou are discussing tonight
is really how you\nprepare, what you
need to go through in order\nfor work to sort of happen.
And I think in the school, this\nis a really important thing.
Like, how are you constructing\nthe conditions for preparation,
in a way, to occur?
Because there are lots\nof creative people.
But actually the relationship\nbetween those sort of ideas
and the circumstances\nof realization, I think,
are really important.
And I really thank you.
- Can I add one point on this?
- Yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.
- You just made me think of it.
Because with architects,\nso often, you're
asked for a design concept.
There's all the famous\nstories about designs
on, like, napkins.
But one of the\nthings-- some artists
are able to totally\npre-conceptualize something.
With George and I,\nit's never like that.
We can pre-conceptualize\nsomething,
and then it completely changes.
And for us, one of the\nmain things we had to learn
was to follow the peripheral.
Because usually your first\nidea, or the main idea, is bad.
It's kind of the most\nobvious, or something.
And your intuition and your\nunconscious can come at it.
And it's like lying in\nthe bathtub sometimes.
An idea does come.
Or when you're playing\naround in the studio
and then you discover\nsomething by a material that
goes together.
Or my daughter\nwill do something,
and I go, like, wow,\nthat's really cool.
You know, that sort of thing.
I think for us, that's the\nmost important thing in our art
practice, to be open\nto whatever happens.
But with architecture,\nyou can't do that.
- Yeah, but what a lot of\npeople in this room are doing
are actually also not that.
Because I think that\nthe exciting thing
about the programs--
if you're dealing with\nquestions of conservation--
that's what I was\nsaying to you earlier--
you're dealing with\naspects of memory
and you do that installation,\nand suddenly, there
is the appearance of the\nspace, but there is also
the memory of that\nspace, and what
actions do you take\nin order for that
to be something\nsimultaneously contemporary
and, at the same time,\nit has a kind of history,
or a kind of historicity?
And I think in all the programs,\nthere are different ways.
Because you're using technology.
I mean, you're talking\nabout art. but. actually,
you're talking about\ntechnology, in a way,
and the relationship\nof technology
to questions of representation,\nand how we kind of relate those
to everyday life.
So what I think is so\npositive is that if you take
any one of our\nprograms, actually there
is a way to make a connection\nwith your work, which I found
normally that doesn't happen.
So that's actually\nvery exciting.
So anyway, thank you very much.
Thank you all very\nmuch for coming.
And I hope you've\nhad a good day.
[APPLAUSE]
