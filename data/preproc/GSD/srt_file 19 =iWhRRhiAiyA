Good evening, everyone.
Thank you so much for joining\nus for tonight's event.
I'm Marrissa.
And this is Lindsay.
And we're the co-chairs of Women\nand Design here in the school.
And we're honored\nto be representing
the organization introducing\ntonight's guest, Rosa Sheng.
We're extremely lucky to\nhave her here tonight.
She's in town from\nSan Francisco where
she's the principal at\nSmithGroupJJR and the 2018
president and founding chair of\nEquity by Design, a committee
of the San Francisco\nAIA chapter.
With some 22 years of experience\nin architecture and design
of roses led a variety\nof award-winning and
internationally\nacclaimed projects,
ranging from the highly\ntechnical development
of Apple's distinctly\nminimal glass
retail stores to the innovative,\nand sustainable LEED gold
certified Lokey Graduate\nSchool of Business
at Mills College in Oakland,\nhome state of California.
In 2013 fueled by the\npersistent and striking inequity
of representation in\narchitectural practice
where women compose\nmaybe 12% to 18%
of AIA members, licensed\narchitects, and senior firm
leadership, Rosa founded the\ncommittee, Equity by Design.
She's initiated a\nnational movement
for equitable practice\ncatalyzed by the circulation
of two pivotal Equity in\nArchitecture surveys--
one in 2014, one in 2016--
surveying nearly\n9,000 respondents,
representing all 50 states\nand nations on six continents.
The next survey will take place\nin the spring of this year.
And we look forward to both\nits findings and its impact.
These surveys have teased\nout the underlying tensions
that persist throughout careers\nin architecture and design,
setting oneself up for\nprofessional development,
achieving pay equity, and\nmaintaining flexibility
between work and other\nlife commitments.
They revealed\ncareer pinch points,
including the time\nand financial burden
of the educational process,\npaying professional dues,
obtaining licensure,\nbalancing caregiving roles
and navigating the\nglass ceiling--
which brings us to\nthe missing 32%.
It's a troubling metric\none, which tells us
that while schools have\nreached nearly equal rates
of enrollment and\ngraduation, architecture
as a professional\npractice still loses
32% of its women between\ngraduation and licensure.
Though this may be our present\nreality, Equity by Design
tells us that this doesn't\nhave to be the future.
They've hosted quarterly\nworkshops and hackathons
as a means to turn these\nmetrics into action and change.
Equity by Design has\nsold out five symposia,
delivered presentations\nacross the US and abroad,
and received widespread\nmedia coverage
from the likes of Architect\nMagazine, Architectural Record,
the Wall Street Journal, the New\nYork Times, TEDx Philadelphia,
and NPR.
Together, Rosa and her team\nhave initiated a national call
to action for all\ngender identities
to help realize the goal\nof equitable practice
and to retain talent,\nadvance the profession,
and communicate the value\nof design to society.
So please join us\nin welcoming Rosa.
[applause]
Thank you so much.
I know it's the\nbeginning of the semester
and you're starting\nstudio and classes again.
So I really am thankful that\nyou made time in your schedule
to be here tonight.
So let's if I can advance.
OK.
So I'd like to start\noff the discussion,
before we get into\nthe meat of it,
with a question I\nalways tend to ask.
And that is to get\neverybody on the same page.
There seems to be a lot of\nconfusion about the difference
between equity and equality.
So when we talk\nabout equity, we like
to make sure that everybody\nhas the same understanding.
So how many people in the\nroom-- no right or wrong answer,
no judgment--
think they have a good idea of\nthe definition between the two,
just show of hands,\nagain, no judgment.
And that's usually what we see.
So I found this meme while back\nand I like to start with it
in terms of defining the two.
Equality as it's traditionally\nmeant is everybody
gets the same exact resources,\nthe same exact piece
of the pie, regardless of\nthe outcome, all right?
So that's fair.
And that's just if everybody\ngets the same thing.
In the equity lens, on the\nright side of the meme,
there's this idea that equity\nis about minimizing barriers
to maximize the\npotential for success,
so people acknowledging that\nwe need different resources
at different times.
One size does not fit all.
And the people\nwith the resources
that don't need them for\nthat particular situation
or challenge recognize\nin others the need
and, therefore, have\nthis empathy eye
of providing that resource.
So on the right,\nthere is a win-win.
Everybody can see over\nthe fence, World Series,
you know, Boston Red\nSox, yay, team, right?
And then this idea\nthat somebody raised
was really interesting to me.
Well, what if I'm always\nthe tall person giving out
my resources?
What about that?
So I happened to say, well, the\nlikelihood that you'll actually
be the short person in your\nlifetime is ever so increasing.
We see that with the natural\ndisasters and things just
randomly happening.
Shootings today was\nreported in Kentucky,
the 11th of the year\nthat was reported
and the 50th of the\nsemester in all schools.
So the likelihood that something\nbad could happen to any of us
is increasing.
So as architects,\nI ask the question,
why does equity matter\nin architecture?
But we start off\nwith the question of,
why do architects matter?
We know that there's some\nanecdotal conversations
about architects\nlosing their value
and people not understanding\nwhat architects do.
How do we create a value\nsystem where we are recognized
and we do meaningful work?
In this sketch,\ncomedy sketch with I
Love Lucy-- if you\nhaven't seen it,
I recommend you go to YouTube.
Lucy and Ethel are homemakers.
And they go and they\nwant to seek jobs.
So they go to the\nchocolate factory.
And throughout\nthe day, they have
failed to accomplish\nany of their tasks.
The last chance they have is\nto go on this conveyor belt
and just wrap the chocolates.
Pretty easy, right?
So the conveyor belt\ngoes faster and faster.
And they stuff the\nchocolates in their shirts.
They stuff the chocolates in\ntheir hats and their mouths
just to keep up appearances.
How many people feel\nlike you're stuffing
the chocolates in your mouth,\nkeeping up appearances?
So your reward is this,\nthe same as Lucy and Ethel.
The boss comes in, sees you're\ndoing an amazing job, and says,
great job, ladies, speed her up.
The conveyor belt keeps\ngoing faster and faster.
So it's against your\nown best interest
to be perceived as just getting\nby and hiding your challenges,
right?
Let's see if we can\nget this to advance.
And then the third question,\nwhy does architecture matter?
So I grew up with this\nidea in the suburbs
that architecture was about\ntract houses and malls
because that was the experience\nof my immediate surroundings.
So when we have a low standard\nand we don't question design
and we don't educate\nthe public about design,
this is what we end up with.
We end up with Malls of America.
And that changed for me\nwhen I went to China one
summer to visit my grandfather.
And he made sure I\ntoured a lot of places
of value, of monuments, the\nForbidden City, the Great Wall.
And he was great in educating\nme about architecture
and saying that\narchitecture wasn't
about the immediacy of\nits use or the people,
it was rather a time capsule\nof a civilization meant
to last beyond any\none person's lifetime
and to provide profound impact.
And at that moment that he\nwas saying all this to me
in Chinese and I was\ntrying to translate it
in my head of what all it\nmeant, I realized at that point
that I wanted to\nhave profound impact
and I wanted to be an architect.
So I went to school at\nSyracuse University.
Shout out, go Orange to\nSyracuse alum in the house.
Did the traditional education,\nlearned about architecture
through a Eurocentric lens.
I questioned that\nbecause I came from
a non-Eurocentric heritage.
As you saw the Great Wall\nand the Forbidden City,
where did that plug into\nthis Eurocentric learning
about design?
But I loved all that I learned.
And I sketched.
And you can see the Pantheon.
And Syracuse had a\nFlorence program.
And we studied and we\ntraveled throughout Europe.
And I had this idea\nthat I was going
to become the next great\narchitect, whether it
was Le Corbusier or Frank\nLloyd Wright or Frank Gehry,
I was going to be that\nnext famous architect.
Because that's what\nwe were taught.
Well, I graduated\nin a recession.
And ironically, I\nended up, my first job
was designing malls, going back\nto my roots, right, and casinos
and bathroom details\nand elevator details.
And I said I wanted more.
And I was questioning\nat that point
whether architecture was\nthe right profession for me.
And my employers at the\ntime said, well, this is it.
You've got to pay your dues.
You've got to-- we're\nshowing you the ropes.
You've got to do\nthe licensure thing
and, you know, build\nup your experience.
And I thought to myself, well,\nthat's not good enough for me.
What do I do next?
Well luckily for me, a friend\nand alumni from Syracuse
lived, worked in Pittsburgh\nfor Bohlin Cywinski Jackson
and said, hey, you why don't\nyou come out to Pittsburgh?
We're doing some\nreally cool projects.
There's this company called\nPixar Animation Studios.
They do digital animation.
What was that, at\nthe time, right?
So, OK, this sounds really\ncrazy and interesting.
Let's go to Pittsburgh so\nwe can go out to California.
And, of course, that\ndidn't work out right away.
I spent a year in\nPittsburgh, but got to work
and was luckily enough\nprivileged to work
with Steve Jobs.
We had weekly, bi-weekly\nmeetings with him where
we would fly out to Pittsburgh.
But towards the\nmiddle of the project,
the client, the facility,\nhead of facilities
asked us if we could\ndo anything differently
because the progress\nof the project
wasn't moving fast enough.
Steve wasn't satisfied\nwith the designs.
And we weren't\ncommunicating fast enough
flying back and forth.
So they took us out to\ndinner, plied us with drinks,
and asked us what we\ncould do differently.
And the craziest\nthing is that I said,
you can move us\nout to California.
And everybody laughed\nat this crazy idea.
But six months-- less than\nthat-- three months later,
they shipped the team out.
And that became the\nSan Francisco office
for Bohlin Cywinski Jackson.
And we had this incredible time\nwith incredible opportunities
as project architect of\nthe Pixar Animation Studios
project, the Steve\nJobs building.
And it was a lesson\nlearned in not
being afraid to ask\nthe crazy question
or proposing the crazy answer.
So fast forward.
At that time, he had\ngone back to Apple.
Whoops, sorry.
And he was starting this\ncrazy idea of a retail store
for just Apple products.
And at that time, there\nwere only about 3%
of the market share.
And people laughed and\nsaid look at Compaq.
They weren't able to do it.
You're not going be\nable to do it either.
And he challenged that idea.
And he had this reality\ndistortion field.
Some of you have-- may\nhave heard of that phrase.
But he questioned and\nsaid, well, why not?
And he pushed us really\nhard in the development
of the first Apple\nStores, the high profile
stores with the glass staircases\nthat didn't exist at the time,
to say, why can't we do this?
Why can't we have an all\nglass structural staircase
without steel\nstructural supports?
So we put on our reality\ndistortion lenses with him.
And we challenged\nthe impossible.
So suspending\ndisbelief for just long
enough so that we could\niterate and iterate and finally
came up with a solution\nthat is now ubiquitous,
so building glass staircases\ninstead of glass ceilings.
And luckily I was fortunate\nenough to be on the patent
because I knew at some point\npeople wouldn't believe
that I was on that project.
And I thought, that's going\nto be a good thing later on
to have my name on the patent.
You could see from the\npicture on the right
that my husband is\nin the photo with me.
We had our photos taken at\nthe glass staircase close
to the eve of the\nopening of the store.
And it was a joke, actually.
Because when I got\nengaged they said,
why don't you get married\nin the Apple store?
And we laughed and said, ha ha.
We didn't get\nmarried there, but we
had wedding photos taken because\nit was pouring rain outside
and it was close by.
Good photo op.
So last of the Apple\nprojects I worked on
was the cube in New\nYork City in GM Plaza.
And at that point,\nI didn't think
that gender was a\nbarrier to my advancement
as progressing as an architect.
But then I got married and I got\npregnant with my first child.
And I would go to meetings.
And my belly was swelling.
And the developer at the\ntime, Harry Macklowe,
he would joke around and he\nwould say, which one of you
was responsible for this?
Was it you?
Was it you?
And it was, of course, all\nmen and one women, right?
So that was the time I\nthought, hey, this isn't fair.
This is weird.
This is awkward.
But luckily I had\na good comeback,
which was to say,\nwell, Harry, I'm
going to name the kid\nMacklowe after you.
And then he said no,\nno, no, don't do that.
So that was kind of funny.
And at the opening, I did bring\nmy daughter and my husband.
And an amazing thing\nhappened because I
announced that I was--
I was retiring from\nthe Apple retail world.
I was going to do other\nprojects that allowed me
to navigate work life balance.
And then a surprising\nthing happened.
Steve said, oh, that's too bad.
But why don't you come out\ncelebrate with us tonight?
We're going out to\ndinner with the team.
And we'd love for\nyou to come with us,
but we only have one\nspot at the table,
so your husband and your\nchild can't come, sorry.
And I said, oh my gosh,\nchance of a lifetime.
But I couldn't go because\nat the back of my head,
there are barriers.
I was breastfeeding at the time.
I wasn't going to tell him that.
And I just said, sorry, I'm\nso flattered that you asked,
but I can't go.
And he was puzzled.
Nobody says no to me, right?
And I thought stupid,\nchance of a lifetime, who
would ever give up dinner\nwith Steve Jobs, right?
So in the middle of the\nday comes back again.
And he says, all right, I've\ngot a spot for your husband,
but no kids tonight.
Can you get a babysitter\nin New York City?
And, again, no way, I\ncouldn't do it, right?
I wasn't leaving my\nnine-month-old behind
or trying to get a babysitter.
And the funniest thing happened\nat the end of the day, which
is that the room was packed.
And he comes across the room.
It was the parting of\nthe Red Sea, like Moses.
And he says this, all right,\nyou drive a hard bargain.
The kid can come.
But if she poops, she\npees, she cries, she's out.
What an invitation, right?
But luckily I knew\nhim for the time
that we worked together\non Pixar and Apple.
And I knew that he was\ntrying to be the tough guy.
He was trying to be\nthe Wizard of Oz,
you know, the man behind the\ncurtain, tough on the outside,
but soft on the inside.
And I realized at that\npoint-- we did go to dinner--
that he was my biggest champion.
And it was a kind of\naha moment that in order
to succeed in this\nprofession not only do
we need champions\nthat speak up for us
and ask us literally to\nthe table multiple times,
but we also need to be\nand cultivate champions.
We need to pay it forward\nto the next generation.
So fast forward,\nmy next project was
an all women's business school\nin Mills College Oakland,
California.
And it was a new\nproject type for me
and awareness about the lack\nof women in the c-suite.
So they recognized\nthat is a need.
They created this program\nout of nothing, a startup
with just 10 people\nthe first year.
So it was year five when\nthey asked us to help them
design this school with them.
And they wanted\nto walk the talk.
So the school itself\nabout business,
socially responsible business.
And then they wanted to be\nable to have a building that
was an experience,\nthat inspired people
to challenge what was possible.
So in the end, they\nalso said that the team
needed to have equal\nrepresentation, so
women in leadership positions.
We had a woman leading the\nstructural engineering,
mechanical engineering,\nsuperintendent, what have you,
including myself as a project\nmanager for the architects.
And, again, it won LEED\nGold first business school
building in California\nand multiple awards.
But it was this idea that\nit still inspires today
and it grew and built\nthis relationship
with the school\nthat hasn't ended,
that they have a\nconference every year.
It's the 10th Annual\nconference this year
about social responsibility.
And it's a joy to\ngo back every year
to see that they're\nstill walking the talk.
So at the end of that-- and\nas you could see, the school,
the student body is diverse,\nso not just women, but men,
people of color, people of\nall different socioeconomic
backgrounds really hitting\nhard at these issues at being
social entrepreneurs.
But then at the end of that,\nthe recession hit in 2009
and I had my second child.
And I was at a\npoint in my career
where I felt the barriers more\nso than I had ever done before
and what translated\ninto what we called
pinch points in the survey.
There's this quote\nby Lin Manuel Miranda
that's very poignant to me.
We all grapple with the paradox\nthat tomorrow is not promised,
but we make plans anyway.
What do we do when we feel\nlike there's no support, when
we feel like when\nwe want to quit
is this kind of marching order\nthat we don't know what's
coming, we can be\nafraid, or we can
make plans to solve those\nissues and challenges.
I was at a point when I was\nready to leave architecture.
I was at a very depressed\nmoment in my life, postpartum,
what have you, compounded\nby the recession.
But there were\nthese lights shining
as examples of not quitting,\nwhether it was architect
Barbie with Despina Stratigakos\nand Kelly Hayes McAlonie,
whether it was Caroline James,\nwho was in audience tonight,
and Arielle Assouline-Lichten\nwith the petition for Denise
Scott Brown, whether\nit was Beverly Willis
Foundation or Lean In, those\nwere lights to say keep going,
do not quit.
And in that self\nevaluation moment
there was this realization\nthat women were not represented
in architecture as we should\nbe, that, again, the statistics
show that we are--
as we graduate, we\nare about 50-50.
And then that number\ndiminishes quickly over time.
So I went to my first\nmissing 32% conference
and was on a panel\nabout negotiation.
And after that, everybody\nwas fired up and committed
and said, we needed\nto do something.
We're tired of just\ntalking about it.
We need action.
What are you going to do?
So we were all fired up.
But then we said,\nyes, we need action.
What are we going to do?
We're going to do a survey.
That's what we said.
We had no idea how\nto do a survey.
We're going to find out\nwhat the problems are.
And then we'll\nsolve that, right?
And at that point, I felt like\nI committed to eating a whale.
So Shel Silverstein\nhas this poem
about Melinda May, this\nlittle girl who touts she's
going to eat this giant whale.
Everybody laughs\nat her and says,
there's no way you could do it.
And she is so indignant and\nshe says, by golly, yes, I can.
Well, guess what?
She did eat the whale.
It took her 89 years.
And I thought, good god.
I do not want to be Melinda May.
I did commit to doing this, but\nI'm not going to do it alone.
I'm going to ask my friends\nto get their forks, come
to the same table.
And while we could all be eating\nour own whales of frustration
and challenge, why don't we eat\nthe same whale, kind of gross?
But it could be a vegan whale.
It's a figurative whale.
But if we all ate the\nsame whale together,
it will not take 89\nor 110 years to see
parity and equitable practice.
Because that is the reality.
If we wait and do nothing and\njust let natural things happen,
it will take another 110\nyears according to statistics.
And then another alum here,\nAlexandra Lange, a Loeb fellow,
was published at the time,\nArchitecture's Lean In Moment.
And this was an\naha moment for me
that she said, we need to create\na new set of best practices
that will, as a design\nproject in and of itself
based on data, shared\nexamples, and interpretation.
Once written, we\nneed to find partners
who will adopt them firm\nby firm, sector by sector.
So that was our call to action.
First study was in 2014.
I'm not going to go\nover the details.
But you can find the information\nonline in our full report.
There is this concept\nof pinch points,
the idea that\nthroughout your career
from when you graduate all the\nway through when you retire
that there could be times\nof challenge and frustration
that causes you to contemplate\nleaving not only your firm
that you're in, but also\narchitecture, potentially.
Hiring, whether you came\nout during a recession
or an economic boom.
Paying your dues, doing those\nsilly little bathroom details
and the meaningless work.
Licensure, the challenges\nand the roadblocks
and the cost of\ngetting licensed.
Or even the significance,\nwhy should we get licensed?
How many people here just\nfeel if licensure is important
or not, just a show of hands.
Is it important?
OK, not too bad.
And then working parents\nwhich transformed
into caregiving because\nit's not just about parents.
It's about self-care.
It's about care for\nyour loved ones.
It's about care for the elderly\nand your community around you.
So time to care is\nan important topic.
And finally, the glass ceiling.
Implicit bias is\nsomething that we
knew was there anecdotally but\ndidn't have a lot of research
on.
So we decided to\nsupport that analysis.
And in 2016, so we had 2,000\nrespondents in the first one.
And then we had 8,664\nin the second one.
And then we added another\nlayer called career dynamics.
So not only are\nthere pinch points,
there are challenges\nthat could happen to you
at any point in your\ncareer, multiple times,
or continuously\nthroughout your career.
Really depressing, right?
So can you find the right fit?
Can you find meaningful work?
Can you find work\nlife integration?
Can you find a place\nthat will value
you give you professional\ndevelopment opportunities?
What if you wanted to take\na break from architecture
and do something\nelse and come back?
And what if pay\nequity or, you know,
being valued for what you\ndid was a constant struggle?
And it is for many.
This study was not just\nabout women in architecture.
It was about men and women\nof all race and ethnicities.
And we also did study\nnon-binary gender to the point
where we asked the\nquestion, but we
didn't do well enough because\nwe only got six respondents.
So this year, we're\nasking a lot of our allies
to help circulate the survey\nso that we get more people so
that we can start\nanalyzing those
that are in a different\ngender identifications.
We did look at\nrace and ethnicity,
as you'll see on the right.
Predominantly, this is\nreflective of who is practicing
right now in architecture.
And before I roll into what\nwill be a giant tasting menu
of a lot of information, I don't\nwant you to get stressed out
that the slides went by too\nquickly because the full video
of the entire presentation--\nthis is about 50% of the slide
data--
is on our website online.
And we will be publishing\nthe final report,
which has more information\nthan you know what to do with.
But it is there for\nyou at your choosing.
So here we go.
Most of our respondents\nvaried in age.
So you could see the\nyounger respondent
pool was mostly women.
The elder respondent\npool was mostly men.
To, of course, correct\nfor that in our analysis,
we always look at things by\nyears of experience, not age,
but how long you've been\npracticing in the profession.
So first order of\nmagnitude is top reasons
why people left their last job.
And this is concurrent with\nwhy people leave architecture
as well, which we did\nin the previous study.
Number one is better\nopportunities.
Two is no promotion\nopportunities, low pay,
relocation, long hours,\nlack of role models,
lack of professional\ndevelopment,
lack of meaningful work.
You'll see these themes\nrepeating over and over again
in different contexts.
So what are the top predictors\nof positive, strong firm
culture that allows people\nto stay in their current job?
Values, alignment of your\nvalues and the firm's values,
that was a top answer.
A seat at the table, being able\nto be heard and also influence
the decision making process.
And meaningful work,\nthat your day-to-day work
is not bathroom\ndetails, but something
that's going to contribute to\nyour long term career goals.
Those things that detracted\nfrom that attitude and idea
about positive work culture were\nthat there was no preparation
by your firm supporting\nprofessional development
and that you had no friends.
That's something that we kept\nseeing over and over again.
So friendships are important.
Why they're important,\nyou will see later on.
When asked who do you\nask for career guidance,
we had a variety of answers.
We tend to see a slight\ntrend with mostly men asking
for senior--
guidance from senior\nleaders, less women.
On the someone else\nside, we see more women
asking those that\nare their peers,
people outside their firms\nthat are in senior leadership,
or family and friends.
But the positive outcome of\npeople who actually get access
to senior leaders\nand guidance, you
can see the uptick for\nboth men and women,
but significantly more for women\nin their career trajectory.
So retention probability,\nenergized work,
career optimism, work life\nflexibility, and focus.
We also looked at this\nnew idea of a spectrum,
the metrics of success in terms\nof burnout and engagement.
So of the different 15\nquestions we asked people,
do you have autonomy at work?
Again, a seat at the table?
Are you confident about\nyour day-to-day work?
Are you satisfied?
Do you find it meaningful,\net cetera, et cetera?
We found that most people\nanswered high on the spectrum.
So the three line is\nactually the neutral.
And then anything above\nthree is positive.
But towards the end, we saw\nthat work life, workload,
and effective promotion process\nwere constant challenges
for both men and women.
Likelihood of\nengagement and burnout,
so on the right side, those who\nare likely to be more engaged,
they answered that they believed\nthat their day to day work
was connected to their\nlong term career goals
and that they were given\nfeedback on an ongoing basis--
so not the annual review,\nbut a constant check
in with the people that were\ntheir report-tos or senior
leaders.
Those that felt that they are\nmore likely to be burned out
answered that their\nhighest aspiration
was to be an unlicensed staff\ndesigner, that they didn't know
the performance\nevaluation criteria,
or that they didn't have\nthose valuable friendships.
When they were challenged, they\ndidn't have anybody to go to.
So we shift gears\nto pay equity, which
is an important topic that\nI know that a lot of you
are concerned about talking\nto some of you at lunchtime.
Average salaries are lower\nthan other industries.
And we know that already.
But even compounding that is\nthe fact that men and women are
paid differently, even\nstarting at the beginning
of their careers.
So approximately--\nyou can't see it
because they're so close\ntogether-- but starting
at the $3,000 difference\nbetween men and women
on average between\nour respondents
crescendoing all the way\nup to $25,000 to $30,000
towards the end of careers.
So why is that happening?
We also cross-analyzed\nthat with gender.
So white males making the\nmost than their not white male
counterparts.
White females, and\nthen, unfortunately,
nonwhite female counterparts.
We also looked at it\nfrom the different roles
that people play in\nfirms, so not just
by the years of experience.
We noticed, shockingly,\nthat design principles had
the biggest gap, making less\nthan principals in charge,
but making between\n$20,000 to $40,000 less
are women who are\ndesign principals.
And that is compounded\nby information
that we see supporting\nthat creativity bias.
Namely, the Fuqua Business\nSchool Duke University
did a study on creativity\nbias where they
did five different studies.
The first of which,\nluckily for us,
happened to be a simulation\nof architecture portfolios.
So, again, simulated\nsame exact images
and sketches and\nrenderings, one was
named male applicant the\nother was a female applicant.
And they were supposed\nto rate the creativity
of both portfolios.
Well, guess what happened?
Both men and women\nrated the male portfolio
more creative than\nthe female portfolio.
They also did that as an\nanalysis with fashion design
and didn't get the same results,\nthat the variance was closer.
And then, to kind\nof additionally
postulate if that\ncreativity bias is there,
we did the Google\nsearch challenge, which
is to name the profession\non Google, type it in,
and then see what pops up.
So this was the first pop\nup of famous architect.
All white male except for Zaha.
Yay, Zaha.
But we have to change that.
Success in negotiation,\nso part of pay equity
has to do with your\nability to negotiate.
How many of you think you're\ngood negotiators for design?
You can advocate the\nheck out of design, yes?
I hope so.
OK, we had that\ndiscussion at lunch
while we are strong at\nadvocating for our design
aspirations and goals and\nthoughts and theories,
we are weak at negotiating\nfor our salaries and things
we think are related\nto money, so contracts,
change orders from\nthe contractor.
So we have to get\nbetter at this.
Our survey said less\nthan 35% men and women
negotiated for\ntheir salaries when
they found them unsatisfactory.
There is a taboo.
And then I know there's a\nlot of information here,
but the takeaway is that\nthe negotiators did better
than the non-negotiators.
So if you don't\nask, you don't get.
But then there's the soft\nskills of learning how to ask
and when to ask and\nthe value proposition
that you bring to the table.
But, sadly, at a point where\nin the middle of the career,
the women negotiators were\nstill making about the same
as the male non-negotiators.
So there is a bias towards\nwomen about negotiating.
The likelihood of\nbecoming a principal.
Again, alarming aha moment\nwas that the non-white males
were least likely to become\nprincipals in the response pool
than the rest of\ntheir counterparts.
And we have to figure out why.
As far as gender\nbalance in leadership,
most people answered\nthat their firms
were perceived as mostly male.
And, again, that is\ncompounded by the fact
that there has been this\nevolutionary process of women
going into architecture\nand the problems
and the hurdles of staying.
But we also find that most of\nthe leaders in architecture
that are women are in\nsmall firms or practices,
so starting their own firms.
And in the large firms,\nthere is a 7% disconnect
between the likelihood of\nmen being more likely to be
principals than women.
Early career trajectories\nand perceptions, so this
is important to all of you who\nwill be new grads pretty soon.
The things that were judged\nas more positive outlooks
were the workload,\nthe career optimism,
and work life flexibility.
In terms of more negative\nwas perceptions were more
the meaningfulness of\nthe work, the involvement
in decision making, the\noverall energy for the projects
that they were involved\nin, and the likelihood
that they would stay in\nthe firm that they were in.
What we learned\nfrom people leaving
was that most people that left\nthe profession, men and women,
were in that zero to five\nyear range because of we
believe the disconnect between\nwhat we're taught in school
is important versus what\nis valued in practice.
And then when we look at the\noffice tasks of men and women
in those zero to\nfive years, we learn
that females are more likely--
sorry, less likely to do the\nfollowing-- firm operations,
strategy planning and thinking,\nBIM design technology,
or firm project standards.
They are more likely to take\ncare of the housekeeping roles
in the firm, which include\noffice library management
and office parties.
So don't take on the role\nof office party planner
or social planner, please.
Just kidding.
If you want to do\nthat, that's fine.
It's important too.
But also go for\nthose other things
that you normally don't\nget a chance to do.
Early career\nretention likelihood,
so the ones that\nsaid that they're
more likely to stay, again, had\nmore access, one-on-one access
to senior staff.
And they believed they knew\nwhat the performance evaluation
criteria was, the pathway\nto advance up the ladder,
if you will.
Those that didn't believe\nthat they were going to stay
didn't see a path forward.
They didn't see the performance\nevaluation criteria.
They didn't have any\nfriendships at work.
There was no prep for new roles.
And even if their firm\nhad evaluation criteria,
they did not know what it was.
So you could see\nthe effect of that.
More men were likely to stay if\nthey didn't know what the firm
evaluation criteria were even\nif they had something written
down, right?
So not only is it good to\nhave performance evaluation
criteria, you have\nto tell everybody
for those practitioners out\nthere and the firm leaders.
Value of licensure,\nso we get back
to the question of the\nvalue proposition of why
it's important or do we\neven think it's important.
The top answers of why people\nthought licensure was important
was the ability\nto call themselves
an architect, the ability\nto practice independently,
and the heightened sense\nof professional standing.
The challenges and\nobstacles of licensure
are what we know today--\nlong hours, high cost, lack
of rewards, difficulty with\nthe actual process, et cetera.
And then the family and\nthe life gets in the way.
So NCARB has been\na great partner
in realizing these\nchallenges with us
and then trying\nto solve for them.
They are providing more\nhelp and advisement
in how to get licensed and\nalso the value proposition.
Firms are continuing by giving\nincentives for licensure,
whether it's a\nsalary uptick or it's
supporting the paying of the\nexam, et cetera, et cetera.
Because ultimately it values the\nfirm in lower insurance rates
and being able to, you know,\nmarket different project types
and get more responsible\npeople into senior positions.
Salary by licensure,\nthose that were licensed
made more than their\nnon-licensed counterparts.
So if you do decide\nto go into practice,
try to get licensed right away.
Find a cohort group to\nsupport you to do that.
The next one is shift into work\nlife flexibility and work life
challenges.
When asked the question, I\nhave time to pursue interests
outside of work, the\npeople that answered yes,
again, believed that their\nday-to-day work was aligned
with their career goals and\nthat the firm leaders actually
took time off too.
They're walking the talk.
They weren't just saying,\nyeah, there's a policy there
for work life flex.
They are taking the two\nweeks off, et cetera
to refresh and re-energize.
Those that didn't believe\nthey had enough time,
didn't know what\nthe criteria were
for performance evaluation,\nthey worked more than 44 hours
a week.
And there was no work life\nflex policies in their firms.
The other interesting\nthing is if people
did take a hit in their--
where did they take\nit in their personal
or their professional\nside of their lives?
Most people, as you could see\nfrom the astounding number,
took the hit on\ntheir personal lives.
So whether it was schedule\nconflicts, poor health,
neglected duties, or\nrelationships crumbling,
that took priority,\nunfortunately,
over turning down opportunities\nor leaving a job, et cetera.
When asked if people had\never been a month away
from architecture or took a\nleave of absence, a break,
most people said that they had\nnever taken a career break.
But surprisingly, if\nthey had the opportunity
to take that career\nbreak, would they?
And a lot of people said\nyes, but I haven't asked.
So this goes back to talent\nretention and the fact
that we don't value\ntaking a career break.
We don't value the\nleave of absence.
But if it means losing somebody\nwho's been there for 10 years,
and the fact that if\nyou had to replace them
it would cost 2.5 to 3 times\ntheir salary to replace them,
that is a value proposition.
Because with that,\ninstitutional knowledge
also goes out the door.
Shifting gears to child\ncare responsibility
and caregiving in this lens,\nwomen in our response support
tended to do more\nof the caregiving
as a primary caregiver.
The stigma of who\nis winning the bread
and who is giving the\ncare is still there
in parallel to society.
And even the time\nthat people take off
for the birth of their child--
one to three days on the\nmedian for men and three months
for women.
And we see this impacting\nthe salaries, of course.
This is parallel to a study\ndubbed the daddy bonus
and the mother penalty.
So who makes the most?
The male parent.
Then the non-parent male and\nthen the non-parent female.
But guess who is\nmaking the least?
It's the mothers.
And then we shift gears again.
So that was a lot of\ndepressing information, I know.
We're going to shift\ngears into what are we
going to do about it.
OK, so when people\nask, why does equity
matter as a conversation in\npractice and representation
and why does it\nmatter in design,
we start off with the premise\nthat the US census reports
that by 2045, the majority\npopulation in the US
will be an aggregate of minority\nrace ethnicity representations.
And why is that important?
That is a frightening\nreality for some people who
happen to be in the\nmajority, but is also
an exciting opportunity to\nsee what the potential is
of diverse thinking and diverse\nbackgrounds in our workforce.
And it starts with\n2025 is the predictor
for the majority of college\napplicants, college student
applicants, which I'm\nsure you're seeing
in your own demographic here.
So in the economy it matters.
Again, if we had\nthe potential of,
if we had minimized barriers and\nmaximized potential for success
for everyone, we would\nbe able to propel
the economy to a point where\nwe haven't imagined before.
As it relates to health\nand life expectancy,
the shocking thing is that you\ncould be living within a 10
mile radius and\npotentially you would
be living nine years less\nin a different area that
has poor access to fresh air\nand clean air and clean water
than the people that\nwere fortunate and more
privileged enough to live in a\ndifferent area code within 10
miles.
We see equity mattering\nas a potential for dignity
and respect and basic\nhuman needs, the idea
that people who are transgender\nare denied the dignity
and respect of basic\nhuman needs is something
that we have a potential\nto influence as designers.
We're seeing that more\nand more with our clients,
particularly in higher ed, but\nin the public sector as well,
of we need the\nall-gender restroom
and we don't want just the\none room on the side checking
the box of all-gender restrooms.
So how can we design\ndifferently to maintain
dignity and respect?
Equity applies also to designing\nplaces for working mothers
and also families in public.
So what is deemed\nuncomfortable and awkward
as women breastfeeding\nin public or diaper
changing in public or the fact\nthat there's kids loitering
and do not loiter or the\nsafety of those around us
that are older and more fragile.
Where is the place\nin society that
is welcoming and inclusive\nand safe for all those people?
And finally, another alumni\nof the GSD, Deanna Van Buren
is doing some amazing work with\nthe Design Justice Advocacy
and designing places\nthat offer dignity
and respect and rehabilitation.
So I went to it.
When I was speaking\nat TEDx Philadelphia,
there was a gentleman by\nthe name of Jessie Crimes.
Yes, Crimes was his last name.
And he was an artist, but\nalso a former incarcerated
in the system.
And what he observed\nas an artist was saying
that the most violent thing that\nhe experienced during his time
in prison weren't\nother prisoners,
it wasn't the law\nenforcement, it was the walls.
And that was this\nshocking aha moment for me
about the humanity--\nthe irony that we
are supposed to be\ndesigning humane spaces
and yet we are denying this\nvital population access to air
and views and light\nof day and what that
does to their mental health.
We hear that, but we\ndon't realize the damage
that it's actually doing.
So she's doing\namazing work there
with getting design\nand access to better
places for those populations.
Why equity matters for teaching\nthe next generation, so
Michael Ford who is a professor\nin the Midwest, in Michigan,
he founded this project\ncalled Hip Hop Architecture.
And he wrote a book about\nhow hip hop is actually
very heavily related to\narchitecture and the fact
that a lot of the projects\nthat were built in Chicago
and out of that era,\nagain, were not humane
and were damaging to the\nsocieties and the culture
of the people growing up in\nthose areas with the violence.
And as an antithesis\nto that, he is
using hip hop as a vernacular\nlanguage for the children
to expose them to architecture\nand the power of design.
And he is being\nsponsored by Autodesk.
And he's been around\ntalking about it.
But he's also had the\narchitecture camps
and the exposure\non the Today Show.
And it's taking off.
These kids who never\nget exposure to design,
access to design\nthinking, or the power
that they can make a\ndifference are learning
what architecture is all about.
And then, finally,\nour own movement
of not just having the\nsurvey but also being active
and activists, we\ngather for a symposium
where 250 people come\nfrom all over not
only the US, but\nthe world we heard.
We had Justine\nClark from Parlour
in Australia last time around.
And as you can see, it\nis more women than men.
But we are getting more\nmen to come to the event.
Because equity is not just\nfor women or people of color.
Equity is for everyone.
And it affects everyone in\nmore ways than you can imagine.
We have panelists talking about\nwhat's happening in firms.
Again, we need firm leaders\nto adopt these practices.
We need them to believe that\nit's not just a business case,
it's not just adding\nanother dollar value,
it's adding value\nto, ultimately, what
we do in our work for society.
And then we ask people to\ncommit to making change.
And I ask that of all of you.
Of course, we can complain\nabout all the problems
we have as architects\nand the fact
that we're currently\nnot satisfied
with the way they are.
But the only way we can make--
you can't be-- you\ncan't be part--
sorry, you can't-- you're part\nof the problem if you're not
part of the solution.
So I ask each one of you to\nthink about deeply what you're
passionate about and to\ncontribute to the movement,
to grab your fork and\neat that whale with us.
We took cards from the\nEames House of Cards.
And that was one\nof the activities
we did where we\nall wrote down what
our personal commit\ncommitments were
and we stacked them up\nlike a house of cards,
aggregating the collective\nenergy of the movement.
And then the hackathon,\nwhich is coming up,
our fourth hackathon\nin New York City
is an idea about using design\nthinking, this Silicon Valley
phenomenon.
The D-school is\nkind of championing
this idea, a different idea\nabout design, which is yes and.
It's not putting people down.
It's not saying my idea\nis better than yours.
It's building upon.
It's improv.
It's innovation.
It's incubation.
And it's saying\nyes and what else?
What can we do better?
How can we do things that\nsolve the problems that we're
facing that\nimminently we believe
we don't have a solution to?
So a group of strangers for\nfour hours locked in a room
together, they become\nlifelong friends.
And they're all from diverse\nbackgrounds, different genders
identities, different\nparts of the US,
different race and ethnicities.
And it was an\namazing experience.
And I encourage you\nto come to New York
this year because we're\ngoing to do it again.
And we had venture\ncapitalists who
said, hey, we should amplify\nthis and support the winning
idea.
So we're still trying to get\nfunding to be able to do that.
Finally, I leave you with\nsome lessons learned.
How do we make change?
So firstly, the metrics.
Support the survey.
If you can, take the survey.
It's coming out in three weeks.
Share the findings.
Share the report.
Share the video.
Measure up.
If you are working\nin a firm or you're
going to be working in a firm,\nbring it there and say, hey,
how do we compare to this?
This is the safest\nway you can to say
there's something wrong\nhere, it's not your fault,
but in a way, this is\nsomething that we can all
work on together and\ncreate positive change.
And then once you've reassessed\nit, if it's not working,
make those changes\nand go at it again.
And as far as\nmeeting goes, how do
we make deeper connections not\nonly as a cohort of mentors
and sponsors and champions,\nbut how do we make a greater
connection to our communities?
And it seems like a lot to\nask of work life balance
already of having\nwork and careers,
but also being a member, an\nactive member and a citizen
of your community.
But that's also the\npathway to job creation
and ideating what's\nmissing in my community
and how can we raise money\nand get that project built.
And, therefore, you become\npart of that client base.
I'm doing that right\nnow with our Board of Ed
and the new schools that\nare being designed, being
that design review\nto make sure that we
do get good design\nin the outcome
because we're spending\nour tax dollars
and we want to be\ncareful with that.
Embrace technology, I don't\nneed to tell you all that.
I usually tell that\nto the practitioners
who are technology tourists,\ndigital tourists, if you will,
not digital natives.
And the way we connect with\neach other is on social media,
through Twitter, through\nFacebook, through LinkedIn.
It's not just people are adverse\nto that because they think,
oh, somebody is\ngoing to troll me
and my life is going to\nend poorly because of that,
I'll be terrorized.
But is actually a way that\nwe can empower each other
and building that\nstrength in numbers,
building that stronger\nnetwork of champions
to support each other.
Seek, be, cultivate mentors.
So not only do you\nwant lots of mentors,
you want to be the mentor.
And then you want to\nteach the people that you
mentor to pass it forward.
Because that's\nthe only way we're
going to get through\nthis together.
Engage with your communities\nand then build your tribe.
Again, you might not find\nlike-minded people around you
immediately when you\ngo into practice,
but you will find\nthem eventually
and especially if you're\nlooking for them intentionally
and stick with them.
Finally, there is a happy\nending to my story-- sorry,
I keep doing that--
of hitting a glass\nceiling, if you will,
and the caregiving challenges.
And I found a firm.
Finding the right fit,\nit was a long journey.
But I found a firm in\nSmithGroupJJR who not only--
I didn't realize at the\ntime because they took
a year of trying to recruit me.
And I kept saying, not\nnow, not now, I'm too busy,
I'm too busy.
But slowly realizing\nthat they did
have values that\naligned with my own,
that they weren't just spouting\noff that yes, we're diverse,
but they were actually\ndoing something about it.
So they hired me to head\nup their equity, diversity,
and inclusion program, but\nalso to practice architecture
in the way that we\nfeel is building value.
So these are just some\nimages of us sharing that out
loud and also that there\nare women leaders who
are mothers in the San Francisco\noffice and all over the US.
So, you know, more women\nin leadership roles
is something that is,\nagain, proof in the pudding
that we're making progress.
And that was something\nthat led me ultimately
to my decision to move.
What's next?
So, again, I mentioned\nthe architecture survey,
the national\nconference in New York,
which is relatively\nclose to here.
And we're doing a bunch of\nworkshops, a design justice
workshop at Grace\nFarms Foundation.
If you haven't had a chance\nto visit Grace Farms,
highly recommended.
They're talking about justice\nas well as art, community,
sustainability,\nand spirituality.
The hackathon and\nalso another workshop
called Architects as\nCatalysts for Social Change.
Again, connecting the meaningful\nwork to your day-to-day work
is so important.
And finally, the\nfifth symposium.
So last week was\nthe Women's March.
How many of you\nwere able to attend?
It's OK you didn't.
I found it, the\nfirst time that I
asked my daughter to go with me,\na future activist in the works.
There's a fork in the\nroad where we are today.
We can choose fear or\nwe can choose hope.
And I hope that we all\nchoose hope together.
Today is the first day\nof the rest of your life.
That is a deep thought,\nexistential thing
I'm going to leave\nyou with in thinking,
what will you do with\nthe rest of your life
to make change and\nprofound impact?
And I thank you all for coming.
[applause]
Hi.
I'm Sarah Kendricks,\na 2018 candidate
for a master in architecture\nand past co-chair
of Women in Design.
And we're going to have a\nfew minutes to think Rosa
for joining us and\ntake some questions.
If it's all right, I\nwill open up the floor
and then hand over to\nall of you to ask Rosa.
So thank you so much for\nthat incredible talk.
At the GSD, we are\nthrilled to currently have
two female co-chair-- two\nfemale department chairs.
But we've still never\nhad a dean that's female.
And our faculty is 70% men\nand 92% men and white ladies.
What do you think the\nGSD administration can
be doing to better advance\nequity within the school
as well as for the future\ncareers of its graduates?
That's too easy.
I just want it on record.
Hint, hire more women\nto be faculty members.
Hire more people of color.
Intersectionality, right?
Not just those binaries, people\nof all different backgrounds.
Because we can't be\nthinking diversely
if we don't have that diverse\nrepresentation in the people
that are doing the teaching.
It doesn't mean that\na white male couldn't
be a diverse thinker and teach\nthe diverse skill set, but,
again--
and if you don't\nsee it, ask for it.
Somebody at Georgia Tech\nwho was in San Francisco,
is a grad student\nthere and she brought
that up to my\nattention, I said, well,
what are you going to\ndo about it, right?
I can't do anything about it.
What are you going\nto do about it?
So she's putting\ntogether a petition.
She's getting the local\nAIA chapters involved
in asking that question.
Thank you.
From the audience?
Here.
I was wondering when\npeople take your survey
and they are not\nnecessarily architects,
how do you deal with that data?
How do you represent it?
I am myself a\nlandscape architect.
And your data is\nvery interesting,
but I'm not exactly sure how\nthat reflects how this all
pans out in my profession.
Sure.
There is a landscape\narchitecture survey.
There is a structural\nengineering survey
as well that's paralleled\nand built on ours.
But just because there would\nbe too much information,
we do ask that the cutoff\npoint, if you will,
is did you go to\narchitecture school
and did you graduate from\nan accredited program?
And that's kind of all we need.
You could currently\nbe practicing or not.
But that's kind of the defining\nline so that we don't go crazy,
you know, with these variants.
Right, with\ninformation overload.
Yeah, but there\nis an ASLA survey
that you could be\ninvolved in or amplifying.
Another question?
Hi, thank you.
It's kind of\nbuilding on that one.
I'm curious-- if you could--
I'm sure you've looked.
If you could describe\nto us a little bit
about how architecture compares\nto other professional fields.
Yes, I don't have that\nslide with me right now.
But we fare, we fare worse\nthan doctors and lawyers.
We fare better than\nengineers and contractors.
Does that help?
Yeah, no, I'm just curious--
I can follow up and\nsend you the slide.
--if there's, like, if you've\nidentified things that are
particularly sticky or\nchallenging about architecture
for, you know--
for women and equity\nissues, yeah--
than in other professions.
We didn't do any\nsurvey analysis on that
because we didn't\nask respondents
of other professions.
But we know from\ncross comparison
that it is the pay issue that's\nthe biggest challenge, again,
related to even education.
You think that we would make\nmore than some educators,
but because of the different\ntracks, if you will, like,
for like, we don't\nmake more than them.
If you count the time\noff, if you will,
if they worked\nthroughout the year,
they would be making\nmore than we would
in the years of experience.
Yes.
Hi.
Thanks for your talk.
And I guess I was\nwondering, similar
along the lines like\nin other fields,
like, what sort of\nsignificant changes
can we make to the kind of\nlarger system of players that
are involved in architecture?
Because, you know, developers,\nlawyers, politicians,
architects are all sort\nof implicated still
in the sort of ongoing\ndestruction of the environment
and also indigenous, I\nmean, indigenous lands.
So like, I'm wondering,\nlike, what sort of--
We're at the cusp\nof that right now.
So the design\njustice advocacy is
starting to connect all the\ndifferent people related
to these aspects of--
highly recommend if you're\ninterested in that to come
to the design justice workshop.
Because it's looking not only\nat the immediacy of the outcomes
of design justice in\nthe built environment,
but where do our\nmaterials come from,
who is building our buildings?
Is it done with fair wage?
Is it done with materials that\nare in sweatshop factories,
et cetera, et cetera?
And it's bringing\nthat awareness.
It's a difficult conversation.
And we're not going\nto solve it tomorrow.
But we are starting to\ntalk about it, right?
I think we have time\nfor one more question.
Yeah.
Ask an easy question please.
Well, it's going to\nbe a fun question.
OK.
So I work with\nwomen who are trying
to make it into leadership.
And a question I get\nasked is, should I
learn how to play golf\nbecause it seems like that's
where everything happens?
And I suspect that there's\nanother side of the question,
which is that if you\nare a person in power,
and that might mean that you're\nlikely to be a white male,
there are things that you might\nwant to learn to do or operate
differently in order to\nmaybe meet the people who are
learning to play golf halfway.
So I guess the question for\nyou is for people in power,
specifically maybe white\nmen who find themselves
in roles of power, is there\none or two or three things
that you would suggest that\nif they want to be allies
they can do to really\nbe proactive allies
and to support rising\npeople of color and women
in their practices?
So there are some\nsuggestions, again,
anecdotally about the events\nthat are more inclusive, right?
So having lunches or rotating\nbetween lunches and happy
hours, right, so that you can\nget more of a mix of people.
And if you take a\ngroup out to dinner,
make sure you do a rotation,\nright, so that you're not just
taking the same group.
That's easy access\nbecause they're around you
and you work with that\ngroup on projects.
And the golfing thing is a\ntough one because I don't know.
Some people like to\nplay golf, right?
And that's fine and good.
But there are other activities\nthat are not gender-specific,
or race, ethnicity.
What are those\nuniversal activities
that people like to do?
I'll name a silly one, karaoke.
I was just talking\nto Peter about that.
Even if you don't like--
or even if you think\nyou can't sing,
I think everybody secretly\nsings in the shower, right,
or in your mind.
And music has such a powerful\nimpact on memory and place.
And I think if you find\nthose common threads that are
universal-- even food, right?
And then experience\nfood in different ways
and not just the\nsame old, same old,
but try to encourage\ncultural exploration
through these universal mediums.
Is that helpful?
Well-- that's all, right?
Oh, thank you.
Yes.
Thank you so much for coming.
I want to say a special\nthank you and shout out
to all the male presenting\nfolks in the audience tonight.
Thank you for being here.
And Rosa, thank you so much\nfor that wonderful talk.
Oh, yes.
Maybe we can give Rosa\nanother round of applause.
