Good evening.
I think we should\nget going so we have
enough time for discussion.
Good evening and thank\nyou for being here
for this keynote talk that would\nkick off a conference, slums,
new visions for enduring\nglobal phenomena.
And I welcome you here on behalf\nof the Lincoln Land Institute
and the Joint Center\nfor Housing Studies
and the Graduate\nSchool of Design.
And I hope you'll also\ncome for the next two days
for the conference.
And before I go on to introduce\nour keynote speaker, Ranjani
Mazumdar, I want\nto quickly thank
Dr. George McCarthy,\nknown as Mac,
president and CEO of the Lincoln\nInstitute of Land Policy,
and Dr. Chris Herbert,\nwho is the managing
director of the Harvard Joint\nCenter for Housing Studies,
for having facilitated\nand supported this effort
and made the GSD a\npartner in this process.
For me personally, these\nare important efforts
that I believe create true\ninterdisciplinary conversations
around really wicked problems\nthat we face globally.
And it has really been\nan educative process
to be part of the\ndiscussion in evolving
a format and thrust for a\nsymposium such as this one.
Dr. Enrique Silva from the\nLincoln Land Institute,
who also teaches here at the\nGSD, Alejandro Mazarro, David--
there are many others\nwho you will see and hear
from in the next few days\nthrough the conference.
And lastly, I want to thank\nDiane Davis, the chair
of the Urban Planning\nand Design Department
for having supported this, and\nour dean, Mohsen Mostafavi, Ken
and Paige for making\navailable the piper
for this inaugural\nsession, and also
including this as part of the\nformal GSD lecture series.
This symposium is about\ntaking perhaps one
of the most enduring\nproblems on the planet,
perhaps aside from\nclimate change,
and exposing ourselves to\nnew frames of reference
and developing new lenses\nto inform our approach
to the global and\nsystemic challenges that
produce patterns of\nsociospatial poverty.
Of course, there's been\nmuch discussion about slums.
And even the use of the word\nslums, we really deliberated.
Because the word slum has a\nlonger and more continuous
history of usage and\nreference that has perhaps
made it more enduring\nthan the more recent four,
five decade-old use of the\nword informal, which also,
in my view, sets up an\nunproductive binary sometimes,
at least from a sociospatial\nplanning and design
perspective.
And I just wanted to\nmake that point here
in the design school.
In fact, Francis\n[? linea, ?] who also taught
here, doesn't even\nuse the word slums
because he feels that's\na generalization.
He uses the word shantytowns\nand it's cultural invention
as a phenomenon.
And so I think the\nusage of these words
is something we are going to\ndeliberate to perhaps come up
with a more\nconstructive, productive,
and instrumental narrative.
I mean, you know, if you\nlook up the dictionary,
the slum is a squalid,\novercrowded, urban street,
distinctly habited, very often\nby poor people, hovel, ghetto,
shantytown favela,\nJhuggi-Jhopri, bustee,
cabbagetown, rookery--
many, many such suggestions,\nbut off the physical state
of a place, of settlement,\nits material and condition.
And of course, used as a\nverb, slumming it out--
that means spending time\nat a lower social level
than one's own through curiosity\nor a charitable purpose.
So it's used in\ndifferent contexts.
And informal, which is off\nthe record, unauthorized,
unsanctioned, confidential,\nunconfirmed, et cetera,
also has great potency.
The word slum\nclearly is directed
towards physical and material\nexistence of a habitat.
So in this context, I think\nwe must understand that cities
are a set of disparities between\nthe intentions of formal modes
of practice and their spatial\nmanifestation on the ground,
thus perhaps no one\ncategory is really adequate
to describe this phenomena\nin the world today.
You know, I often hear\nin the design school--
I'd like to share this.
Marc Angelil, who is a\nprofessor at the ETH,
once shared with me their\nbig project on Ethiopia.
And it was a project that\nwas incredibly well-funded.
And they were looking\nat informal settlements.
And so they took 20\nstudents, got a bus,
spent two days identifying\nan informal settlement,
spent eight days mapping it--
photo montage, measure drawings.
And they kept the last\nday for interviews.
Now social scientists would\nhave done exactly the opposite.
And so after they finished\ntheir incredible documentation,
in the second interview, they\ndiscovered it was actually
a formal settlement.
It only looked like\nan informal setting.
[laughter]
And so I just want to say\nthis in a design school
because the aesthetic\nquestion also
becomes a very important one.
And the baggage we carry\nof that lens of aesthetics
is also highly\nproblematic sometimes.
And I hope we can\ntogether peel away
some of these layers\nin our discussions.
So we have oscillated between\nthe word informal slums.
And like I said, in\nmy own understanding,
it encodes the\nphysical condition.
And formality is the process\nof becoming and operating.
And so if you look at\ngovernance and claims and modes
of citizenship and many\nother political questions,
informal, of course, is a much,\nmuch more productive category.
And so there is this\ncontinuing tension
that we have to somehow resolve,\nbecause they are intrinsically
linked.
And often, the discussions\naround these terms
are nonproductive\nbecause we unintendingly
inflate one or the other\nmore often and then sometimes
use them interchangeably.
We've also focused on\nslums because these spaces,
for all our three\ninstitutions involved,
challenge our usual\nnotions of housing,
land occupation processes,\nas well as urban form
and urbanism more broadly,\nversus the making and imagining
of the ideal manifestation\nthat we all aspire to,
which is to say that the formal\ncity also produces slums.
Slums really present\na compelling vision
that potentially allows\nus to better understand
the blurred lines of\ncontemporary urbanism
and the changing roles of people\nin spaces in urban societies.
In this context, an\narchitecture or urbanism
of equality in an increasingly\ninequitable economic condition
requires looking deeper to\nfind a wide range of places
to mark and commemorate\nthe cultures of those
who most often are excluded\nfrom the spaces or architecture
and urban form of global flows.
And the camera, as our keynote\nspeaker, Ranjani, has argued,
has the ability to\npenetrate those lives
in these otherwise\nmarginalized spaces which
are hard to present in any\nother abstract terms or form.
Cinema, she argues, is not\nan institutionalized medium
and thus is not taken seriously\nas a scholarly enterprise
in its form.
And it is for this\nreason that we
choose to begin our symposium\nthrough the lens of film.
Ranjani Mazumdar is a\nprofessor of cinema studies
at the School of\nArt and Aesthetics
at the Jawaharlal\nNehru Institute, JNU,
as as it's called.
Her publications focus on\nurban culture, popular cinema,
gender, and cinematic city.
She's the author of\nBombay Cinema an Archive
of the City, which\nshe did in 2007,
and co-editor of a\nforthcoming a Wiley Blackwell
Companion to Indian Cinema.
Her writings have appeared\nin anthologies as well
as journals, such as Bioscope,\nContinuum, Screen, Social
Research, Journal of Television\nand New Media, et cetera--
very widely published.
She has been a European Union\nfellow in the on Indian films
at the University of\nWestminster in London,
a fellow at the Davis Center of\nHistorical Studies at Princeton
University, a British Academy\nfellow, a fellow in Paris,
visiting faculty at the\nDepartment of Cinema Studies
at New York University, and\nseveral other such positions.
She has also worked as\na documentary filmmaker.
And her productions\ninclude Delhi Diary 2001
and the Power of the Image,\nwhich she has co-directed.
Ranjani's body of\nwork and practice
speaks about cinema's ability\nto both blur and perpetuate
the formal versus\ninformal binary
that has become a definite\nelement in the approaches
to the enduring global\nphenomenon of slums.
What can be said about the\ncomplexity of contested space,
where thousands, even\nmillions of other individuals
are staking their own claims?
How does one even begin\nto frame the issue
without simplifying it?
Perhaps cinema offers\nus a point of entry.
Cinematic creative\nprojects have the ability
to blur the boundaries\nand prevent us
from realizing concrete\nand fixed assumptions
about the world.
What if we understand the\ninformal city and the slums
that produce as the\nexpression and representation
of the unrealized aspirations\nof the formal city?
How might this lens inform our\nunderstanding of the broader
visual landscape as another\nspace where the most
extreme have-nots lack agency?
To work in the contested\nspace of slums,
we must recognize is\na political choice.
When we examine the\nrole, for example today,
of doctored videos and\nfake news items which
have played a major\nrole in fueling
the flames of our current\npolitical climate,
we recognize the\npower of the visual
to blur or sharpen boundaries\nof privilege and power.
Such a reality became\nexplicitly clear to our speaker
in recent years.
Since February, 2016,\nthe students and teachers
at the JNU university where\nRanjani is a professor
have been at the receiving\nend of extremely hostility
by the Indian National\ngovernment, the BJP.
The president of the students'\nunion, Kanhaiya Kumar,
was arrested and\ncharged with sedition
for supposedly shouting\nanti-national slogans
at an event on Kashmir.
Six other students\nwere arrested.
These events led to countrywide\nprotests, political debates
in parliament, heated\ndiscussions on issues related
to nationalism, patriotism,\nthe freedom of expression,
and the laws related to this.
Teachers say the ecosystem\nof the university,
known for its liberal views and\nculture of political activism,
is in a fragile\nstate of existence.
Teachers went on\na hunger strike.
And there have been\nall sorts of protests.
Here in most of the academy\nin the United States,
we are privileged\nand hard to imagine
that, for example, an\ninstitution like Harvard,
for example, coming under\nsome similar fire, where
our daily lives are not\nimpinged on in complicated ways.
Perhaps not-- maybe\nwe are close to that.
But when our voices\nare suppressed,
how do we keep integrity?
Can we also think\nabout and be aware
of our academic environment\nas another space
where slums are defined,\nnot by their inhabitants,
but by experts,\npractitioners, and scholars,
and what does this mean\nis something I think
we should also be aware of.
What are the\naesthetic decisions we
make as designers and\nprofessional policymakers
and academics when asked\nto represent the space
and define what we call slums?
And I think this is the\ntype of dialectic space
that we hope the\nsymposium will foster.
The keynote lecture will be\nfollowed by a discussion, which
will involve Janice Perlman\nand [? brodwyn ?] Fischer,
responding to the lecture and\nthen a discussion moderated
by Mac, George McCarthy, who\nis the president and the CEO
of the Lincoln Institute of\nLand Policy here in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.
The Lincoln Institute seeks\nto improve the quality of life
through effective use,\ntaxation, stewardship of land.
He will tell us more about\nthe institution and its work
in the coming days.
But as a short intro,\nwhat I would say
is Mac is well-known for\nhis blunt and honest views
and his ability to challenge\nas well as inspire those
he works with.
He has long seen land\nuse policy as a means
to reach gritty goals.
He's worked for his role\nas a teacher, researcher,
and funder.
He will introduce\nthe respondents
after the keynote lecture.
And with that, I invite\nProfessor Ranjani Mazumdar
to deliver her keynote lecture\ntitled, The Cinematic Slum.
Thank you.
[applause]
Thank you very much,\nRahul, for the introduction
to the symposium\nand to my own work.
I feel honored to have got\nthis invitation to kickstart
a symposium like this.
And I hope I can provoke\nsome new types of questions
with what I have to say today.
And I will not waste much\ntime and begin immediately,
because we want to stick\nto a tight schedule.
The slum has been a visual\nforce in a number of city films
from across the world.
The use of certain geographical\nlocations in popular discourses
about crime and poverty\nhave given shape
to a diverse range\nof images that
are at once powerful,\nmythic, and disturbing.
I would like to present\ntoday an account of some
of the perceptions that\nhave fueled the imagination
of the cinematic slum.
Let me start with the discussion\nof the planetary consciousness
at work and some of\nthe literature on slums
and then trace its relationship\nto photographic and cinematic
forms.
As I will show, this planetary\nvision, often influenced
by certain kinds of\nurban plans, policies,
and academic\ndiscourses, translates
into an aerial imagination.
These aerial views are,\nhowever, constantly threatened
by an overspill of challenging\nimages that foreground
a dense slum ecology.
Whether exploitative,\nsensational,
or prone to accusations\nof poverty porn,
the range of cinematic\nimages offered
a hyper-sensory encounter\nwith the world of the slum.
These encounters rely on\ncertain techniques that
are unique to cinema\nand therefore provide
an alternative form\nof knowledge that
is different from\nsociological, historical,
and economic accounts of slums.
I hope to focus particularly\non the visceral, violent,
and embodied forms\nof experiences
that the cinematic slum\nhas become known for.
In his book, Planet\nof the Slums,
Mike Davis presents us\nwith an apocalyptic account
of a future overwhelmed\nby the expansion of slums.
Large-scale migration\nto the cities
has resulted in\ncongested spaces.
And the slum is now\na fait accompli.
While slums have been a presence\nin most cities of the world
in the second half\nof the 20th century,
the global south\nhas increasingly
witnessed a concentration\nof squatter settlements.
Davis's account is powerful.
It makes us sit up\nwith a sense of shock
and asks us to understand the\npower of statistics and data
that he parades for the reader.
The whirlwind of\nstaggering information
is meant to shake us\nout of our reverie,
to recognize a crisis that\nis at once economic, social,
political, and ecological.
The cover of the\nbook provides us
with a high angle view\nof a Brazilian favela.
A decade after the publication\nof Davis's book, Johnny Miller,
in his award-winning\nphotographic work
titled Unequal Scenes, captured\naerial views of inequality.
Miller started work\ninitially in South Africa
but soon branched\nout in 2016 to use
drones for the capture\nof striking images
from around the world.
These images provide high\nangle views of major cities,
with dense clusters of\nlow-income housing set
against the wealthier districts.
The countries where\nMiller took pictures
include South Africa, India,\nTanzania, the United States,
and Kenya.
The desire to generate\nthese high angle images
came to Miller during his time\nas an anthropology student
in South Africa.
He was struck by the tin\nshacks and their existence
right next to the\naffluent neighborhoods.
Says Miller, and I\nquote, "The images
that I find the\nmost powerful are
when the camera is looking\nstraight down what's
known as nadir view, looking\nat the actual borders
between rich and poor.
Sometimes this is a fence,\nsometimes a road or wetlands,
with small shacks of\npoor houses on one side
and larger houses or\nmansions on the other.
Whatever it is about\nthe composition
of those photographs, they are\nextremely powerful to people.
I think the images make\ninequality relevant.
People can see themselves\nreflected in the images.
And it\'s deeply\nunsettling," end of quote.
There is an uncanny\nresemblance in Davis's account
in the Planet of Slums\nand Miller's photographs
in his Unequal Scenes.
Both capture broad\ntrends in the world
and focus on scale,\nnumbers, and the desire
to instill a sense of shock.
There is something powerful in\nthis spectacle of inequality.
And it is hard to ignore it.
The issue, however, is the\ndeployment of a distanced gaze,
both in the book and\nin the photographs.
This distance is created\nby an aerial perspective,
a planetary view,\nso to speak, which
recognizes an essential\ninterconnectedness
between all humankind\nand the earth,
a relationship that transcends\nnations to foreground a shared
vision of a united humanity.
The aerial view popularized\nsince the experience of flight
is now a widespread\nform and has deeply
affected the way we understand\ngeography and territory.
While aerial photography has\nbeen constructively deployed
in the service of\nwar, cartography,
and archaeological\nsurveys, we need
to understand how\nthis form of vision
emerged so strongly as\na cultural phenomenon.
In the course of its\nhistory, the aerial view
has offered us the fantasy\nof visual possession
of vast space.
Since this form of\nlooking is distinctly
different from ground\nlevel perception,
there is a quality\nof abstraction
that comes into play in any\nhigh angle view of the world.
What we experience\nis a move away
from a complex and contradictory\nreality to an image form
where the unruly and\nthe untidy appear tidy.
This is a process where\neyesores seen at ground level
get transformed\nthrough aerial vision
into striking\nforms of spectacle.
Complex social context, lived\nrealities, and experiences
are reduced to a\nplanar spatiality
that instills a generalized\nnotion of the universal.
Davis's book has been classified\nas urban crisis writing
by Ravi Sundaram, an\napocalyptic imagination that
seems to steer clear from\nthe complexities that exist
inside the slums themselves.
Miller's photographs seem\nto carry Davis's ideas
into his striking account of\ninequality seen from above.
These descriptions,\nhowever, do not obviously
capture the concrete experiences\nof the slums' inhabitants.
As against Davis's\napocalyptic imagination,
we do also have other\nperspectives that
have documented not just\nthe concrete realities
and experiences of\nthose living in slums,
but also provided access\nto the infrastructures
of the informal economies that\noperate in these locations.
The effort in these\nmicro accounts
has been to trace patterns as\nwell as distinct differences,
to understand the diverse\ncontext of slum worlds,
the way they look,\noperate, and survive.
There are many examples\nof this kind of work.
In Shadow Cities,\nRobert Neuwirth
provides narratives of\nordinary slum dwellers.
For two years, he explored\nslums in four continents.
And despite their world\nof poverty, despair,
and political corruption,\nhe experienced a great deal
of the human spirit.
The book has a\nstrong tone of hope.
And squatters are\npresented as entrepreneurs
who cope by staying\noutside of the asphalt
world, the term used\nby them to refer
to the streets and political\nsystem of the legal city.
The book takes us to\na sense of community,
a place of friendship and bonds,\nand a highly productive life.
In some ways, these\ntwo opposing tendencies
of expressing the\nexpansive horror
of the slum\nexperience via numbers
and statistical\nclassification and the search
for a spirited community\nof residents engaged
in informal networks\nof the economy
has framed the popular dynamics\nof slum representations.
In the cinematic world,\nhowever, this narrative
becomes complicated.
Danny Boyle's Slumdog\nMillionaire, released in 2008,
became a major success across\nthe world with its rags
to riches story.
Based on a novel, the primary\nstructure of the narrative
moves between a popular\ntelevision game show,
How to be a Millionaire,\nand memories
of one of the contestants,\nJamal, a Muslim boy
who grew up in Bombay slums.
Just before the\nfinal round, when
he is about to win a\nlarge sum of money,
Jamal is picked up by the\npolice for questioning
because the host of\nthe show can't believe
a boy from the\nslum could possibly
know all the answers to the\nquestions asked in the show.
The narrative does not try to\nbe plausible or believable,
for the focus clearly was to\nfind a language with which
to convey the memory of\ngrowing up in Bombay's slums.
The film was both controversial\nas well as appealing.
There is a desire to penetrate\nthe density of Bombay's slum
world, to access sensory fabric.
Boyle deploys a cinematic\nlanguage of encounters
to explore the\nnetworks of the slum,
to narrate the stories\nof two brothers,
yet the labyrinthine\nstructure of the space
defies any easy access\nto a totalizing view.
A key issue for us here\nis that of navigation
since it is in the\nworld of cinema
that we have seen the most\nsustained desire to move
into these spaces, to\ntrade on various kinds
of spectatorial experiences of\nfear, excitement, voyeurism,
and thrill.
This is absolutely central to\nthe way the idea of the slum
has become enmeshed in our\nthinking of certain kinds
of urban spaces that we\ndo not always know well
but have only\nheard of or learned
about via a global production\nof pictures and documents, news
reporting, literature,\nand cinema.
This indeed is what makes\nthe slum iconography so
difficult to establish, since\nits so-called authentic life is
now no longer available\noutside this blitzkrieg
of visual production.
Slums are diverse\narchitecturally, socially,
in terms of infrastructure,\nand in terms
of the geographical locations\nwithin urban spaces.
They are mysterious,\nalways around
but never fully understood.
So the techniques\nused by cinema have
tended to play with the\nnature of the medium itself.
Giuliana Bruno refers to film\nas a form of modern cartography,
where we can clearly\nsee connections
between space and emotion.
Forms of mobility\ndeployed by cinema
usually take us\nacross time and space
to invoke a unique\nmap of filmic affect.
Slumdog revels in this\nkind of expressivity.
The opening sequence\nin the film uses
the chase, a popular\ndevice in cinema,
to navigate Mumbai slums.
Boyle takes us to Dharavi as the\nsite for the story to unfold.
Dharavi is one of the\nlargest slums in Asia
and houses around\n700,000 people.
It is a complex space, a\nsite of high productivity,
poor infrastructure, outsourced\nlabor, and global networks.
Within this space, many\ndifferent lives co-exist.
And not all of these stories are\ncaptured by Boyle in Slumdog,
and yet it is what\nhe captures that is
of particular\nsignificance for us
to understand how a narrative\nof embodied knowledge
is presented as a distinctly\ndifferent imagination
from the planetary\nconsciousness at work in Davis
and Miller's work.
If the high angle drone\nimagery that we have just seen
seeks to generate abstract\nspectacles of shock,
Boyle assaults our senses with\na form of visual cartography
to invoke the ecology\nof Mumbai's slums.

The sequence starts with a\ndynamic view of an airport
track, the hazy apartment block\nskyline, the impish playfulness
of the children, to finally\nenter the streets and bylanes
of Dharavi as the children get\nchased by a police constable.
The chase is superbly\ncrafted, an energetic run
that reveals various\naspects of the space to us.
Yet this is a form\nof mapping that
foregrounds the bodily\nexperiences of the children
and their deft navigation\nacross rooftops, alleys,
water pipes, and staircases.
The constable finds it difficult\nto negotiate the space.
The children, on the other hand,\nhave a relationship of play
as Boyle edits their\nspeedy movement to music.
We see the slum as a\nspace with giant pipes,
sewage, blue-colored\nplastic floating in water,
narrow alleys, and a combination\nof tin and thatched roofs.
The two kids really\nknow their way around
as the director moves\nfrom ground level
to the high angle shot\nshowing the thatched roofs.
This play between\nthe high and the low
is interesting since up close,\nwe get a sense of the slum
as we blur through the alleys.
This is typical for\nany chase sequence,
since its attempt is always\nto capture a sensorium
and thrill of\nmovement through what
appears to be very dense space.
Through this\nopening sequence, we
are provided access to a\nform of spatial knowledge
that children possess.
A similar controversy about the\nsensational nature of the film
shadowed Fernando Meirelles's\nCity of God, released in 2002.
City of God is based\non a true story
set in 1960s Rio based\non a best selling novel
by Paulo Lins, who\ngrew up in a favela.
The narrative moves between\nthe '60s and the '80s
and follows the different\njourneys of the two
protagonists, Li'l Ze, a dreaded\nteenage gangster, and Rocket,
another teenager who wants to\nbecome a photographer to escape
the favela.
The story unfolds from the\npoint of view of Rocket.
City of God adopted a style\nthat relentlessly pummels
the spectator with\na tale of drugs,
crime, and corruption\nlocated inside the favelas.
It is intriguing how\nthe opening of the film
opens with a similar\ncartographic impulse
as Slumdog but with a\ndistinctly violent edge to it.

- Don't fucking run off.
Give me that.
Hey, melonhead, you fucking fag.
- A picture could change my\nlife, but in the City of God,
if you run away, they get you.
And if you stay,\nthey get you, too.
- They're coming for us.
- It's been that way\never since I was a kid.

The significance of\nboth these sequences
lies in their\nattempt to carve out
a mediatized imagination\nfor a discussion of slums
in a globalized world.
Both films deal with the\nmetamorphosis of childhood.
This focus on childhood is\nnot unknown in the history
of world cinema.
And yet there is something\ndifferent about films
like City of God and Slumdog.
A brief comparison\nwith certain depictions
available from an earlier era\nmay help to shed light on this.
Hector Babenco's\nPixote, released
in 1981, and Mira Nair's Salaam\nBombay, released in 1988,
are two iconic\nfilms of the 1980s.
Both films on childhood\nexperiences of poverty
were inspired by\nthe Mexican film
Los Olvidados, which translates\nas The Young and the Damned,
directed by Luis.
Bunuel in 1959.
In each of these films, the\nslum is the master narrative
that is never overtly present\nin its architectural density
but is the infrastructural\ncondition for the way
that children experience life.
Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay\ndeals with the lives
of street children.
Shot in the slums\nof Bombay, the film
shows the story of Krishna,\na 10-year-old boy who
works for a traveling\ncircus but is
abandoned when the employers\nmove away abruptly.
He then heads for\nBombay and gets
a job working as a tea boy.
The film centers on\nKrishna's daily deliveries
to a brothel and the\nassortment of characters
he meets over there.
Salaam Bombay builds on\na sentimental narrative,
with the child retaining an\nintrinsically human quality
that remains untouched\nby his circumstances.
The film refrains from\nany direct articulation
of physical aggression.
There are intimations\nof potential violence,
but we don't see them on screen.
And the desire to hold\nonto some [? originally ?]
sense of innocence\nor absolute truth
remains the dominant emotional\ntexture of the narrative.
Many critics and viewers\nhave compared Nair's venture
to Babenco's Pixote, released\nearlier in the decade.
As abandoned cast-offs,\nthe children of Pixote
live by their wits on the cruel\nstreets of Sao Paulo in Brazil.
Their survival depends on\nthe trading of sex and drugs
as the narrative takes us\nthrough a series of events
that act upon the children.
Unlike Salaam Bombay, there is\nsomething relentlessly brutal
in Pixote.
It's like being in a\nno-exit world, where not
even the cleverest of\nthe children can survive.
A sense of desperation\nruns through the narrative
with absolutely no hope\navailable for the children.
We are made to view a cataloging\nof strange atrocities, where
beauty is forever doomed\nand a sense of entrapment
emerges as the dominant emotion.
Babenco takes an ironic\napproach to the aerial view
by opening the film with a\nstraightforward introduction
to the film's context.
[video playback]
- [speaking spanish]
[end playback]
This opening,\nhowever, has little
to do with the series of\ndevastating brutalities
we witness in the\nrest of the narrative.
The opening introduces us to a\nbroader context with statistics
and a wide angle\nframe of the slum.
For the rest of the narrative,\nthe actual slum disappears.
This is a sequence\nfrom the reform
school, where Pixote is sent.

- Drawn up by\nPresident Figueiredo
and on the bond of\nfriendship which unites
Brazil and Uruguay.
- Violence on the streets of\nSao Paolo increases daily.
At dawn, the body\nof LCB was found.
He had been missing\nfor two weeks.
The director of the institute\nexplained to our reporters.
- Fights are frequent\nbetween the children,
mostly due to their\nsocial background.
Concerning the boy\nwho was found dead,
I have been informed that he\nhad been brutally beaten up
by one of his colleagues\nand that the attacker has
been identified.
- His assailant, a minor,\nhas a police record
of armed robbery,\nassault, and one homicide,
a typical juvenile delinquent.
- I don't know.
I really don't know.
I went and he wasn't there.
They told me he had run away.
Then they told me he\nwas in the infirmary.
Then a boy told\nme that was a lie,
that the police had got him.
I don't know who's to blame.
[crying] I just want my son.
I think this institution's\npretty mysterious.
The boy's mother saw it.
And I did see the boy\nin a terrible state.
He couldn't have taken a step.
How could he have run away?
- It's enough.
Everyone to bed.
[end playback]
Notice how the media here is a\nmediator between a public world
and the reform school.
The film's context of\ncorruption, violence, and crime
is a threat the children begin\nto understand after they hear
this telecast on television.
It is ironic that the boy who\nplayed Pixote, Fernando Ramos
da Silva, went back to\nthe streets after the film
was over and was\nultimately killed
by police bullets in 1987.
In Los Olvidados, the film that\ninfluenced both Salaam Bombay
and Pixoote, the\nopening sequence
introduces us to the\nport of New York,
the island of Manhattan\nwith its skyscrapers,
the Eiffel Tower in\nParis, Big Ben in London,
and then downtown Mexico City.
Bunuel's vision is informed\nby a healthy holism
for whom poverty\nand the poor are
shown in the unrefined\nreality of urban misery.
[video playback]
- The great modern cities,\nNew York, Paris, London,
hide behind their\nmagnificent buildings
homes of misery that shelter\nmalnourished children,
without hygiene, without\nschools, a harvest
of future delinquency.
The society tries to\ncorrect this evil.
But the success of its\nefforts is very limited.
Only if in a near\nfuture children's
and adolescents' rights\nare vindicated will they
be useful for society.
Mexico, the great modern\ncity, is not an exception
to this universal rue.
That's why this film based\non facts from real life
is not optimistic.
And it leaves the\nsolution to the problem
to society's progressive forces.
[children playing]
[drum beating]
[end playback]
Bunuel's project was\nclear, a demystification
of poverty, camera\nwork that went
against the usual\ntechniques of social films.
The film mocks its\naudience, savagely
denying any space for\nmiddle class sentiments
as it narrates the brutalized\nexperiences of Mexico's
urban delinquents.
The use of these postcard and\naerial views in the opening
sequence was to address\na Mexican audience
about the existence\nof slums everywhere.
Bunuel here was\nsquarely negotiating
the anxious nationalism\nof third world elites
about the global\ncirculation of films
depicting poverty\nin their country.
Pedro, one of the\nprotagonists in the film,
is sent to reform school\nby his unfeeling mother
for a crime he did not commit.
He escapes from there\nto make his way back
to a fugitive life.
He is finally killed by his\nfriend from the street gang
that they were all part of.
The body is discovered\nby people who know Pedro.
But fear of being\nimplicated in the crime
leads them to wrap him\nunceremoniously in a bag
and throw him down\na garbage dump.

- Good evening.

[playback ends]
While these three very\nsignificant films on childhood
are distinctly different\nin their approach,
together they offer a\nset of interventions
on the slum child's existence.
In these slice-of-life\nnarratives,
events act upon the\nchildren and their bodies.
Despite their very\ndifferent styles,
a binding element\nin the three films
is the influence of\nItalian neorealism.
Let me quickly describe\nsome of the features
of this cinematic\nstyle, which emerged
in the context of post-war\ndevastation in Italy
and soon became a global\ndebate about realism and cinema
in the decades to follow.
Where am I?
[laughs] In the\ndecades to follow--
neorealists were\ncommitted to a notion
of the everyday [inaudible].
One of its theorists,\nCesare Zavattini,
referred to it as a\ndailiness of people's lives.
The camera should just\nenter the ongoing unfolding
of reality as a guest.
Neorealists believed in\nan unconditional focus
on the present, to explore how\npeople's actions were shaped
by necessity and circumstances.
Real locations,\nstreet images, the use
of nonprofessional actors, and\nan analytical documentary style
became the chief characteristics\nof the realist mode.
There was a belief here in\nthe ontological wholeness
of the reality being filmed.
They preferred the long take\nand depth in cinematography
and did not appreciate\nthe use of montage
or any other\nstylization generated
at the post-production stage.
Nair, Bunuel, and Babenco\nused nonprofessional actors,
along with an overt use of many\nof the well-known conventions
of Italian neorealism.
The aerial view was\nironically structured
in two of these films\nwith a clear belief
that observation from an\nexternalized point of view
was perhaps the best way to\ncapture a sense of reality.
Bunuel's Los Olvidados,\nhowever, played
with surrealistic elements\nand remained unsentimental
till the end.
He was clear about\nthe role of the camera
and did not want to\nexpress some naive
discourse on authentic reality.
It is perhaps this\nfilm that in some ways
offers us the entry\npoint for a discussion
of the hypersensory drives of\nboth Slumdog and City of God.
The most significant\nelement in both films
is the movement between\npast and present
and the stylized use of\nflashbacks, techniques
that neorealism did not deploy.
In both films, the\nchildren grew up.
And the temporal play between\nchildhood and the present
offers an unusual instance\nof embodied knowledge
that is foregrounded as a\ndeep and felt experience,
yet there is no\nfixed identity that
emerges since we have\ntwo sets of characters
in each film, both\nfollowing different parts,
despite a common and\nshared experience.
They are not sociological\ntypes but subjects
who approach life differently.
Close to the end of City of\nGod, Rocket, the narrator
of the film, is confronted\nwith a dramatic moment when
the police suddenly\narrive and start
to round up the gang's leaders.
Li's Ze is one of the\nfigures who is arrested,
only to be taken\nto a secluded place
where a deal is struck\nfor his release.
All this is captured by\nRocket on his camera.
This is something he's\nable to do primarily
because of his embodied\nknowledge of the space.
Let me show you a clip\nfirst before I offer
my thoughts on the sequence.
[video playback]
[background voices]
- Rocket, where are you going?
- I got something closer up.
[distant yelling]
[car screeching to a stop]
- OK, lovebirds.
- Come on, Li'l Ze.
Let's go settle our scores.
Not you.
you're a present for the media.
[trunk slamming]
[background voices]
[camera whirring and clicking]
[footsteps]
- Does it come to 10,000?
- Almost.
That's all I have.
- That's all there was, Chief.
- We've searched everywhere.
- Let him go.
- What about his ring?
Is it gold?
- Fill it up.
You'll owe us the rest.
[crash]
- Fucking [non-english].
[dog squealing]
[non-english]
- You're fucked, eh?
- Kids.
We'll have to do a few hold-ups\nto get my business going again.
- Your business, Li'l Ze?
- What's your problem, kid?
- This is for our\nfriend, motherfucker.
[gunshot]
A Soviet attack!
[gunfire]
- The business is ours!
[kids yelling]
[frenetic music]
[camera whir]
[playback ends]
So we see Rocket running\nthrough the favela space
with great confidence, a\nmaze of decrepit walls,
unclean streets,\nrooftops, and garbage.
His camera captures\nthe backdoor deals
between the cops and Li'l Ze.
This is immediately\nfollowed by Li'l Ze's murder
by a rival gang of younger\nkids known as The Runts.
The camera is a\nprotagonist here precisely
because it is in the\nhands of Rocket, who
knows how to navigate\nthe favela and draw
on his embodied knowledge\nof it to get the best
possible pictures he can.
Making the world of\nthe favela visible
is dependent on who\nis photographing it.
Once Li'l Ze is\nkilled, the camera
goes into a frenzied\nstate to finally
show us his dead body on the\nground from the point of view
of the camera that Rocket has.
His speedy return to the\nsite of the body this time
is presented like\nan abstract blur.
The details of the same\njourney made earlier
is now rendered abstract.
Perhaps the blurred\nform is asking
us to reflect on the nature\nof embodied experience, which
is showcased first\nthrough Rocket's run
to the exact location from\nwhere he can get his pictures
and then make visible\ninto an abstract loop.
In Slumdog, all the\nanswers that Jamal provides
are drawn from his own\nembodied experience of life.
In a sequence early\nin the film, he's
asked a question\nabout the god Ram.
And we are taken to a powerful\nmoment from his childhood.
Jamal's mother is washing\nclothes inside a water tank
at the center of the slum,\nher two children playing
in the water.
Let me show you\nthe sequence now.
[video playback]
[train whistle]
[distant voices]
[voices fade]
- [muffled voice] Run, Jamal!
Run!
Salim, Jamal, run!
- They're Muslim.
Get them!
- Come on, Salim.
Come on.
- Jamal, let's go.
[yelling]
[baby crying]
[muffled background yelling]
- Run!
- Let's run!
[screaming]
- Hey, get lost!
Why are you standing?
Go home.
- Go, Jamal.
- Come with us.
- Wake up every\nmorning, wishing I
didn't know the answer\nto that question.
If it wasn't for\nRamah and Allah,
I would still have a mother.
[dramatic music]
[playback ends]
The sequence that we just\nsaw begins with a high angle
perspective with the camera\npanning from the trains
to the water tank.
The public activity of bathing\nand fun for the children
is suddenly interrupted\nby the train scene
from Jamal's mother's\npoint of view.
Before she sees the\nrioters, she displays
an instinctive knowledge of\nsomething that appears amiss.
She just about manages\nto warn her children
before she is bludgeoned\nto death by the rioters.
As the children run\nthrough the slum,
they witness a\nseries of events--
the house been burnt, a man on\nfire, stabbing, the looting,
and the cops\nsitting in their van
with no intention of\nintervening to stop the riot.
These moments are woven into\nthe fabric of the sequence
as the language of\narchitecture, news photography,
uncanny intrusions,\nand the children's
bewildered expressions\nprovide the aesthetic form
for the expression of violence.
We then return to Jamal\nnow in the studio,
his face marked by\na grave expression,
a violent moment from the\npast vividly felt even today.
Jamal now gets his answer right.
The specter of Ram,\nthe reference to Allah,
are all drawn into\nhis complex account
of a life seen in the slums.
As he relays his\nanswer to the TV show,
the spectator is made\naware of the nature
of embodied experience,\nfelt and relayed as memory.
In doing this, Danny Boyle is\nprivileging the sensory world
of the slum inhabitant\nand moving away
from a realist and objectivist\naccount of life in the slums.
Both films offer descriptions\nof sites and spaces
which are conveyed through\nthe language of memory.
The recognition that\nthe catastrophes
of the past, present,\nand future are
located in the\nspaces of the city
saturates the overall\nvision of the films.
The shadow of death and\nplay creates an intersection
between memory and\nsetting, time and place.
Memory gives form\nto the city just
as the city transforms memory.
Knowing a city\nwell is linked also
to childhood, the\nability to play out
the intersections between\nchildhood impressions
and the adult's\nability to recall.
It is this interconnectedness\nof perspectives
that Walter Benjamin\nhad described so vividly
in his reflections on childhood\nas a conceptual framework
for urban memory.
The child provides\na disruptive vision
that punctures the notion\nof the adult's recall
as stable and distant.
The perception of the\nchild, in a sense,
becomes a privileged\nmode of knowing.
But it is in the fullness of\ntime and the space of adulthood
that meaning is achieved\nretrospectively.
The significance\nof the past comes
to light only in the context\nof a pressing present.
It is the complex relationship\nbetween the memory
of a particular site and the\nsite of that particular memory
that is of immense importance in\nthe narratives of urban recall.
City of God and\nSlumdog Millionaire
are unique for the\nway they operate
through these\nlandscapes of memory.
They also draw on a form\nof mediatized language,
televisual liveness, music\ntelevision, news photography,
the use of digital effects.
These intermedial elements\ncreate their own sensorium,
which some have described\nas hyper-realism.
Both Slumdog and City of\nGod adopt a multimedia
expressivity.
And it is interesting how\nthe media itself is so
crucially placed in both films.
Jamal in Slumdog is speaking\nto us through television,
while in City of\nGod, Rocket's memory
is channelized for the world\nthrough his photographs.
In City of God, the\nevents move at a pace
that becomes difficult to\nretain for the filmmaker.
There is a desire to\nrecognize the media
world and its circulation\nof popular culture,
to stage this entry\ninto slum life.
Through these intersections, the\nfilms make it clear that they
cannot transcend into a\nplanetary perspective.
Rather, life itself has\ncome to resemble the movies.
Igor Krstic, in fact, suggests a\nconnection between the gunshots
and the camera in City of God.
By drawing on a more general\ntendency of popular cinema,
particularly in popular\nmale action, horror, crime,
or gangster film\ngenres, the film
probes the ethical limits\nof representing violence
on screen.
Narrative itself\nfrays at the edges
as events bleed through\nwith great force.
I hope through the\npresentations today,
I have managed to foreground\nthe distinctly different logic
at work in the capture\nof slum life on screen.
Thank you.
[applause]
[inaudible]
Well, I guess that's\na hard act to follow.
Thank you, Ranjani, for\nthe disturbing images.
The goal of our two\nand a half day venture
here is not to\ndisturb you entirely,
although we don't mind\ndisturbing you a little bit,
but actually to provoke.
And so I'm just going to\nthis as the first opportunity
that I'll have to provoke you\nand say after watching this,
do we think that\nslums are a problem?
And the reason I ask\nthat is because if you
look at the way we have\nentitled this two and a half day
adventure, it's nothing\nabout the problem of slums.
But it's about an\nenduring phenomenon.
And so what if we imagine that\nslums are the answer, and then
the answer to what?
Because maybe their endurance\nis the illustration of a fact
that somebody benefits\nfrom their existence.
And those who benefit\nfrom their existence
have lots of reasons not\nto do things about slums.
We come to this discussion after\nmore than 100 years of attempts
to deal with slums and after\nmore than 200 years at least
of their existence\nat scale in cities.
We haven't been able to do\nvery much over 100 years,
although we've talked\na lot about it.
And so I have an idea that\nmaybe our account is wrong.
And maybe our account\nwraps around it
in narrative like the narrative\nthat film then reinforces
that then leaves us all feeling\nso numb and unable to act
that we just assume that\nthe problem is just either
too big to deal with\nor maybe we forget
that slums themselves\nactually represent
the answer to something.
But what is it?
I don't know.
But maybe we'll find out\nin the next couple of days.
So I'm George McCarthy,\notherwise known
as Mac, the president\nat the Lincoln
Institute of Land Policy.
Now I want to welcome up\nto the stage to respond,
as we're now going to have\nto make some sense out
of the horror that we just\nviewed-- and it was stunning,
I have to say, but chilling--
Brody, Brodwyn\nFischer, a professor
of history from the University\nof Chicago and Janice
Perlman-- oh, OK.
All right.
I guess I should have\ngone over there--
and Janice Perlman,\nthe president
of the Mega-Cities\nProject and researcher
at the Columbia University.
And so one of the things\nthat Ranjani showed
us is that how we view\nor where we view slums
are clearly an important\nfact, a point of view.
And part of the point of view\nof the way we look at them
are in still photos or even\nin images that only depict
kind of a moment in time.
And I think that\nmaybe it would be
useful to start with kind of\na more historic perspective
to actually put slums into a\nlonger frame, a longer vision.
And so Brody, maybe\nyou can give us
some reflections on what we\njust saw and provoke us further.
Thanks.
Thank you.
It's an honor to be here\nand a pleasure especially
to share the stage with this\nwonderful three colleagues.
We have very little time.
So I'm going to get\nstraight to the point.
As a historian of Latin\nAmerica and Brazil,
I would like to do three things\nin these quick comments--
the first is to try to place the\ninformal city that we've just
seen in these filmic\nrepresentations both
in the context of time-- to\ntake us back in time and think
a little bit about cinema\nin the early stages,
particularly in Brazil--
and also to take it to\nthe realm of other kinds
of cultural representation\nand talk a little bit
about how film is very similar\nto other ways of representing
the favela that we can\nsee in other contexts
and other spaces.
I'll then second\ngo on to talk about
what is the nature\nof the messages that
are coming from cultural\nproduction about the favela,
particularly in Brazil, but\nalso in this larger context?
And lastly, I'd like to\ntalk a little bit about what
that has meant in terms of\nthe kinds of policies that
tend to be created on the basis\nof the images and the visions
that we see in film\nand that we see
in other cultural\nrepresentations.
So it's actually\nreally a privilege
to be somebody who\nworks in Brazil
and to think about these issues,\nbecause Brazil has had places
that have been\nidentified as favelas,
as shantytowns, as informal\ncities, for almost exactly 120
years.
1898 was the date that the first\nfavela was named in Brazil.
It wasn't the first time\nthat that kind of settlement
existed.
But it was the first\ntime that it was named.
And importantly, that\nwas when it began
to be thought of as a problem.
And almost as soon as\nthat kind of neighborhood
began to be thought\nof by the elite,
by architects, by planners,\nby governors, as a problem,
then it started\nto be represented
in different kinds of media.
The first filmic representations\nof favelas in Brazil
are actually from the 1900s,\nfrom the very beginnings
of the genre of film\nin Brazil itself.
And they were not surprisingly\nrepresentations of Carnival.
Carnival came from the favelas.
And the music samba\ncame from the favelas.
And almost as soon\nas it began to make
its way into the\nstreets of Rio, you
began to have photographers\nand filmmakers
going and trying to catch\nsnippets of that live action.
You had the first\nactual lengthy film
devoted to the favela in 1926.
It was a rant\nagainst favelas that
was meant to justify\na removal campaign
by a member of the\nRotary Club and a very
important influential policy\nmaker named Mattos Pimenta.
And then in 1935, you had\nthe first long action drama,
not only that was the first\none to be set in the favela,
but a movie-- it was called\nFavela Dos Meus Amores-- that
was considered the very first\nserious dramatic national film
in Brazilian cinema.
So it wasn't only the first\nrepresentation of a favela,
but it was actually\nthought to be
the beginning of\nthe representation
of some authentic vision of\nBrazil in the cinematic realm.
And that juxtaposition\nis very important.
It isn't just a kind of external\nrepresentation of this place,
but an external representation\nof this place as something
that represents what\nBrazil is all about.
And so that's a very\ninteresting difference,
I think, between the\nfilms that we've just seen
and some of these early films.
It was followed in the 1950s\nwith two very important films
that are understood\nas the beginning
of cinematic realism in Brazil\nby Nelson Pereira dos Santos.
One of them in 1955 is\ncalled Rio 40 Graus--
so Rio 40 Degrees\nor 110 degrees--
and another one in 1957\ncalled Rio Zona Norte.
And then, of course, there's\nthe very famous Orfeu Negro
in 1959.
And this series of\nfilms is actually
the beginnings of\nthe representations
of the favela in Brazil.
And it was coincident\nwith the beginnings
of these kinds of\nrepresentations in other parts
of Latin America as well,\nalthough I don't have time
to talk about that.
One of the things that's really\ninteresting about these films
is that they mimic in\nmany ways other forms
of cultural production.
So we have, for example, in\n1903, the very first example
of a chronicler who goes\nup to the hills of Rio
and wants to expose them\nto the rest of the world,
wants to tell everybody\nwhat these places are like.
That begins in 1903.
You also have samba, which is\na kind of popular journalism.
And its material,\nits prime material
from the very\nbeginning, is to tell
outsiders what the world\nof the favela is like.
And this becomes, by the 1930s,\nBrazil's national music, right?
And so Brazil's\nnational music is
about these places, usually\nvery positive representations,
the favela as a site\nof authenticity,
of love, of community\nin this sense
of togetherness and unity.
It's also, of course,\na space of blackness.
And it's the first\ncultural medium
in which blackness is really\nportrayed in a positive light,
is through samba.
You have photographers\ngoing up in the hills
as early as the early 1900s.
And poets and novelists\nsoon followed.
There are, in 1935,\ntwo major novels
that are set in favela\ncommunities and that project
to the rest of the world what\nthese places are all about.
And then, of course, you\nhave the modernist artists
who very famously go up into\nthe hills in the 1920s and '30s
and produce not only\npaintings, but also other forms
of more abstract visual art.
And poets follow them\nup into the hills--
all of this to say that\ncinematic representations are
very old.
And they're part of a whole\nkind of cultural construct
that exists from very, very\nearly on in the history
of these kinds of settlements.
Now the second question-- what\ndoes this cultural production
tell us?
Now there's a very\nsimplistic way
of thinking about this--\nthat it can tell us
good things about the\nfavelas and bad things
about the favelas, right?
And if we were to\nthink about the movies
that we've just seen,\nthere is, of course,
a deeper level where\nwhat we're seeing
is the nature of the\nprotagonists in these films.
And I very much agree that\nthere is, in these latest
representations, a lot\nmore depth, a lot more
understanding of the meaning\nof what these places are.
But they are overwhelmingly\nnegative representations--
representations of suffering,\nof violence, of extremes.
And one of the things that's\ninteresting about Brazilian
films is that from\nthe beginning,
they're not\ncompletely about that.
In fact, the early\ngeneration of films
is much more about these\nexperiences of human emotion,
experiences of family,\nexperiences of connection,
experiences of all of the\nthings that the sambas
were telling the rest\nof the Brazilian public
that favela life was all about.
So they'll say the\nasphalt, the city,
those are the fake people.
Those are the liars.
Those are the policemen\nand the authorities
that come in to beat us up.
But we here, we have invented\nthis beautiful musical genre.
We understand what human\nfeeling is all about.
We understand that\ngreed is wrong in a way
that people down\nthere on the asphalt
who are speculating on real\nestate don't understand.
And we want you to see our\nauthentic Brazilian black life
here in the favela.
And so there's this kind\nof positive representation
that comes across in these early\nfilms that's very interesting.
Of course, there's also a lot\nof negative representation.
And films were used\nas propaganda pieces
to try to build sentiment\nagainst what were understood
to be all of the problems of\nthe space of the favela as well.
But I won't repeat that\nbecause that vision, I think,
is projected far more\nthan the positive vision
that I've just told you about.
But there's also a\ndeeper level that I just
want to spend the\nvery few minutes
that I have left explaining.
And that is that\nwhether these films
and these other\ncultural expressions
were positive or\nnegative, whether they
saw beautiful blackness\nor whether they
saw degenerate, racialized\nideas of misery and marginality,
no matter which side\nof that they fell on,
there are certain\ncommonalities in all
of these representations.
And to put this in\nvery few words, what
it is that they're\nseeing in the favela
is a space that is separate,\na space that is enclosed,
and a space that\nis fundamentally
understood as other when you\ncompare it to the asphalt, when
you compare it to the city.
You can even see that it\nLos Olvidados in that clip
that we just saw this idea that\nyou have these modern cities.
And then you have\nthese other spaces.
And the other spaces are\nin some ways timeless.
They don't belong to modernity.
They don't belong to what the\nrest of the city is about.
So there's this separation.
There's also this idea in\nall of these cultural mediums
that you need a\ncultural guide, that you
need some kind of intermediary\nthat's going to take you--
and this is from 1903 on.
They actually say it outright.
You can't go up to the\nfavela by yourself.
You need someone to take you\nand explain to you what is what,
because you're not going to be\nable to navigate these alleys.
You're not going to\nbe able to understand.
So whether the guide is\nthe chicken in City of God
or whether the guide\nis the chronicler that
was such a common persona\nin these early chronicles,
you need somebody else\nto explain it to you.
And that person generally\nin the early years
is from the outside.
They're not from the inside,\nas we just saw in those films.
There's also an idea\nin all of these,
as I said before, that\nthis is a place apart.
It is strange.
It's picturesque.
It's fantastical.
It's grotesque.
But it is another world.
It is not the same world\nthat the presumed observers
are observing from, right?
There is this kind of\nseparation between these spaces.
There is also a notion that the\nrest of the city might exist,
but there's an invisible\nfrontier between the spaces.
It's the aerial\nphotographs that we just
saw but written into\nthese texts much
earlier than aerial photography\nwas actually existing.
And one very important\nexception to this
is the film Rio 40 Graus, Rio\n110 Degrees, which actually
has an aerial view\nat the beginning
like you see in later films.
But the aerial view\nis actually meant
to open our eyes to the\nfact that the favela is
much bigger than the\ncity, that in fact,
if you go away from the central\ntouristic points in Rio de
Janeiro, most people are living\nin these alternate spaces.
And it really makes\nthat point very clearly.
But that's rare.
In most of these films,\nwhat you're seeing
are these very clear frontiers\nbetween these spaces.
And finally, in all\nof these movies,
everything is happening in\nthe urgent present tense.
And that's something that's\nvery true, I think, in the films
that we've just seen.
Even though they have these\nhistorical flashbacks,
there's this sense of urgency.
There's a sense of now.
There's a sense that these\nare places where everything
is always urgent, because\nlife or death always
depends on what is happening\nright now in these kinds
of places, right?
And this is very early on in\nthe history of these places
as well.
All right.
So finally, just a couple\nof sentences on what
are the seeds that these\nimages place for policy?
Now it would take\na lot more time
than I have to talk about the\nspecific positive and negatives
and the specific\nkinds of campaigns
that these lead to, not only\nin Brazil, but in the rest
of Latin America.
There's a lot to do with\nthat that I don't have time
to do it.
But one point that I would like\nto-- or two points that I would
like to specifically emphasize--
one of them is that films\nand other cultural media
have tended to reinforce\nthe notion that you need
an outsider to understand\nand mediate these problems,
that the policymakers and the\npeople who are going to decide
what to do about this problem,\nand even the people that
are going to decide\nwhat the problems are,
they are not the people that\nare the object of the gaze.
They're not the people that live\ninside of the slum communities.
You need a mediator.
You need somebody\nfrom the outside
to come and tell you\nwhat the problem is
and how it ought to be solved.
And the function\nof the people who
appear in this\ncultural media tends
to be to simply express\nthe suffering, the problem,
the experience of being a\nvictim of whatever problem
it is that has been identified\nby these mediators, right?
And that, of course, is very\nimportant in policy terms
because it indicates that\nthe table, the people who
should be at this conference,\nthe people who should be
at the places where\ndecisions are made,
are the ones who are observing,\nwho are being explained
to by these mediators.
They're not the people\nwho are being observed.
And I think that that's\na very important function
that a lot of\ncultural media have.
And I would even say that\na film like City of God
continues with that\nfunction, even though we're
seeing it from the perspective\nof this person who grows up.
The filmmaker really did\na lot to change the book
that it was based\non in ways that
really reflect an outsider's\ngaze in important ways.
And then finally, I'm just\ngoing to end with one last more
provocative point, which is\nthat in emphasizing the notion
of these communities as\nbeing closed to the outside,
as being self-contained,\nas being the expression
in and of themselves\nof a problem--
that is, they are\nproblematic spaces.
Maybe they're problematic spaces\nbecause they're victimized.
Maybe they're problematic spaces\nbecause they're oppressed.
Maybe they're problematic\nspaces because the people who
live in them are somehow\nmisformed, somehow
full of anomie, or full of\nviolence, or full of rage.
Whatever the reason,\nthese are portrayed
as problematic spaces.
And they're also\nportrayed as spaces
that are not defined\nby their connection
to what is outside of them.
And I think that that\nfundamental insight,
that notion that the problem\nthat we need to solve
is within the favelas\nborders, has consistently
misshapen the sorts of\npolicy remedies that
are being proposed both by the\nleft and by the right and even
sometimes by the\ncommunities themselves,
and that if we were to take\nan aerial view that's not
like Mike Davis's notion\nof an aerial view,
but take an aerial view that\nactually tends to emphasize
what Rio 40 Graus, what\nRio 110 Degrees could see,
which is that these are spaces\nthat in all kinds of ways
are fundamentally\nconnected, not only
physically and\neconomically and socially
to the rest of the city,
but these are also\nspaces that serve
a function within the systems\nof economic inequality
and also the systems\nof power relationships
that govern the city as a whole.
That is, these are not places\nthat are there by accident.
But they are places\nthat actually
have a place in larger\nstructures of power,
larger structures\nof inequality, that
are the actual roots\nof the problem.
It's not what happens within\nthe favelas borders that
causes whatever aspects of\nfavela life result in suffering
or are problematic.
The problem is actually\nin that relationship
between those spaces and these\nlarger structures of power.
And cultural\nrepresentations tend
to downplay that by focusing\non the favelas as spaces apart,
as spaces that deserve to be\nfocused on without reference
to what's going on around them.
And I think that's\nsomething that we can really
take forward, I hope, in\nthe next couple of days
of discussions at\nthis conference.
Thank you.
[applause]
Thank you [inaudible].
[applause]
Thanks, Brody.
And because I'm blunt, I\nwill restate your point
in a different way,\nwhich is to say,
what if slums or favelas\nor these alien other places
within our cities are not\njust integral to the life
of the cities, but they're\nintegral to the success
of the cities?
The cities themselves would\nnot thrive and flourish
without the existence\nof those favelas.
So that was our provocation.
We're going to try to\nreserve a little bit of time
for questions.
We have a couple of people with\nmicrophones in the audience.
But I want to turn\nto Janice now to get
her provocations and her views\non the amazing things we've
just seen already today.
So is this live?
Yes.
Thank you.
Well, thank you so much,\nBrody, and thank you.
That was just-- it's a\nvery hard act to follow.
I'm very thrilled to be here.
And well, I'm still in\nthe emotional throes
of seeing those visuals.
I just wanted to start--
while I was listening to you,\nI thought of just starting
by reading-- since this is in\nthe Graduate School of Design,
and it's architecture--
reading a quote that\ndescribes the new urbanism.
This is from The Guardian\nof April 30th, 2014.
"The new urbanism\nprovides for communities
which are robust,\nresilient, sustainable.
They have high\ndensity and low cost,
living in locations within\nreach of work by foot or bike.
They are closely knit with\nself-reliant communities
in which ties of families and\nneighborhoods are strong."
Well, if I ever\nheard a description
of a favela or any other\nsquatter settlement, that's it.
So I mean, that's to\nanswer your question of
wouldn't it be wonderful\nif this is the way,
this would be the model\ninstead of getting
into an elevator in\na high rise building
after you go through\na gate and then
looking at the\nceiling or the floor
to not make eye contact with the\nother people in your building?
So this is why, in\nmy book, Favela,
I wrote a little poem\ncalled "Why I Love Favelas."
So my point, I\njust wanted to say
that number one, if you look\nat the way images of favelas
in Rio have metamorphosized\nover these years,
I would say it could be said\nto go from the slandered slum
to the inclusivity to\nthe fetishized favela
and back again.
Squatter settlements are the\nfastest growing percentage
of the world's\npopulation right now.
And they have\nconstantly been, as you
described, seen as other.
So I was going to pick\nup on this concept
of how powerful the ideology\nis and the image we have
of favelas and how easy\nit is to blame the victim
once you see these.
And I was just going to give\na little whirlwind tour very
quickly through how the\ncircular relationship played out
in Brazil from the beginning\nof my research in 1968
during the military dictatorship\nto my current research, which
was from 2015 to\nthis last month.
So it shows exactly\nwhat Brody was saying,
this powerful relationship\nand interrelationship
between the images we\nhave and the visions
we have in our heads\nand public policy.
What makes public policy\npossible and acceptable
is the images that are sold to\nus as what the policy is acting
upon, the people and the spaces\nthe policy is acting upon.
So during the dictatorship in\nBrazil, which started in 1964,
favelas were seen\nin the usual way
you've seen portrayed--\ndangerous, dirty, violent,
family breakdown, prostitution,\ncrime, every possible thing,
unhygienic.
And if you read any of the\noriginal discussions of any
of squatter settlements\nanywhere in the world,
you'll see the same\nunhygienic metaphors.
Even Gordon Parks, who did the\nwonderful photography in Rio
in 1961 of Catacumba, one\nof the favelas I lived in,
he talked about the\npathetic story of Flavio.
There are pictures in\nhis book of a little kid
with cockroaches crawling\nover him and little
Flavio with his shirt torn.
And it was all about the\npathos and how pathetic
and how we have to come in\nand help them and raise money
from Life Magazine readers.
I mean, I lived in that\ncommunity a few years later.
There was nothing\npathetic about it.
People were working, organizing,\nfighting the government
to get urban services,\nwithholding their votes
from the one place\nthey could vote for,
which is city councilman, to\nbargain with among candidates
for better improvements.
I mean, they're really savvy\nand really well-organized.
And yet these images of favela\nas the so-called cancerous sore
on the beautiful body\nof Rio de Janeiro
made it very easy to justify\nremoval, the bulldozing down,
the massive destruction\nof people's lives,
this community\nwhere Flavio lived,
Catacumba in the south zone,\nthe wealthiest zone of Rio.
People were removed.
They were threatened\nby police violence
and removed in garbage trucks\nto public housing projects
outside in greater distance\nfrom their work and school
and health access than\nthey could navigate.
And they were put in\npublic housing projects,
including the City of God.
That was one of\nthem and other names
that came from the\nAlliance for Progress.
One of the places was called\nVilla Alianza, Alianza para el
Progreso.
And one was called\nVilla Kennedy.
So the United States was\ncomplicitous in this idea
that this was cleaning\nup and improving
the lives of these\npeople with, again,
no reference to what the\npeople would like or choose
your their own trade-offs.
And the other thing\nis that once they
were located in these\npublic housing projects,
they were made to pay 25% of\ntheir previous family income
every month towards a rent.
And since their family\nincome decreased by 75%
because they no longer\ncould work two or three jobs
and the kids couldn't\nwork after school
and the wives\ncouldn't get in-- it
was too expensive for the\ntransportation-- many of them
defaulted.
And in their defaulting\non these payments,
they were sent to\nwhat very well could
be described as debtors prison.
They were called Casa de\n[? triaging-- ?] triage houses.
Triage in war are\nthe patients who
were too sick to be worthy of\nthe scarce medical supplies
and left to die on\nthe battlefield.
So they were left to\ndie on the battlefield.
And the pictures I was going\nto show before we decided
not to show any PowerPoints\nin this section,
would show these\ntriage houses, which
were way out in the boonies,\nyou'll see on the map.
They're not connected to\nanything, all lined up,
little boxes in the\nbaking sun, and then
show more and more\nand more being built.
And then I zoom\nfrom 1973 to 2011.
And I show the same houses,\nrows and rows of them, with row.
And that's the new\nBrazilian housing project
called Minha Casa, Minha Vida--
my house, my life.
They couldn't come up\nwith one new design
with all those brilliant\narchitects and planners
from 1973 to 2010--
I mean, really?
OK.
So my research-- in 1968 and\n'69, I lived in three favelas
in Rio.
And what I found out\nexactly was that the reason
I called my book The\nMyth of Marginality
was that these people who\nlive in these communities
were not marginal at all.
In fact, they were\ntotally tightly integrated
into the rest of society, just\nin a very asymmetrical manner.
So they gave their labor,\ntheir political support,
their social and cultural\nlife, to the city
but got almost nothing\nback in return.
And my mantra was, they're not\nsocially disorganized, which is
what they were supposed to be.
But they're excluded.
They're not\nculturally backwards.
But they're stigmatized.
They're not\neconomically parasitic.
But they're exploited.
They do the jobs\nthat no one else
would do in conditions\nno one else would
accept for salaries that\nno one else would work for.
And yet they're taken for\ngranted and treated terribly.
And they're not\npolitically radical.
No one had to be scared of\nthem making any revolution.
They were so happy\nto be in the city.
And they weren't\ncomparing themselves
to the rich people who\nlived next to them.
They were comparing themselves\nto the people back on the farm.
And in comparison,\nthey were doing great.
And they knew they\nwere investing
for the future generations.
So the policy\nimplication of the fact
that they were seen as marginal\nwas to get rid of them.
And so it was very easy to\njustify the massive removal
of 100,000 people.
They were burned out.
They were shot at.
They were totally traumatized.
Fast forward, the end\nof the dictatorship
comes the democracy, 1985,\nthe new democratization.
And we all think\nthat, of course,
we're never, ever going\nto see removal again.
Because now favelas, who\nwere either 20% or 25%
of the population of the city,\nnow they're going to vote.
No one is ever going\nto remove them again.
And so the new\nidea is incorporate
them and the inclusive city.
And then there's upgrading.
And so the policies, the\nvisuals about favelas starting
to be better, films come\nout like Favela Rising,
which shows these beautiful\nnonprofit organizations
like AfroReggae\nthat organize kids.
As an alternative to\ngoing into the drug gangs,
they can go into an equally\nbonding social group that's
based around music\nand rhythm and song
and expressing the words\nof living in a favela.
So all of this gets translated\ninto massive programs
of onsite upgrading, where\ninfrastructure is brought
to the favela that's\nsupposed to equalize
the infrastructure that's\nhappening on the asphalt.
And at this moment, there's a\nvery nice political alliance
between the city government,\nthe state government,
and the federal government.
And there's a big program called\nFavela-Bairro, which is jointly
funded by Inter-American\nDevelopment
Bank and the national Brazilian\ngovernment and the city.
Unfortunately, just at the\ntime that democracy returned
and everyone got out of jail,\nall of the war on poverty
that the US was\nrunning and closing
the Columbia borders\nredirected the narcotraffic
through Brazil.
So now all of these drugs were\nflowing into Brazil, especially
cocaine.
And it was taken\ninto the favelas,
where it could be divided\ninto smaller parcels
and where the police had\nusually not penetrated,
especially after\ndemocracy because police
had been very abusive.
And so the idea of Brizola was,\nlet's just police the asphalt.
So aside from those\nwinding streets
where you see the chase scenes,\nthere was a very convenient way
to hide this drug traffic.
And even though less\nthan 1%, less than 0.01%
of the people in the favelas\nwere doing any drug trafficking
or drug use, they returned\nto the idea of favelas
as a place of criminality,\nviolence, and danger swept
back.
And all the images swept back.
And there are many,\nmany films came out
about the violence and Escuadron\nDe La Muerte and Tropa de Elite
and terrible, terrible things\nabout the violence, the drug
wars.
OK.
So the media, of course,\nis promoting this,
the global one, television.
And you see this always,\nphotographs of violence
and death in the papers.
OK.
Fast forward-- then I get\nto come to my second study.
So my second study\nwas 30 years later
after I lived in these favelas.
I interviewed 750 people,\n250 in each of three favelas.
So I tried to find them\nagain, 30 years later.
I found several\nhundred-- more than 41%.
And I interviewed them.
And I interviewed their children\nand their grandchildren.
And I already had\ninterviewed their parents
or asked about them.
And then we found that a whole--
I started documenting this\nmetamorphosis of marginality
and the actual social mobility\nthat many of the kids-- not
the original people\nin their own lives,
not so much their children.
But in the grandchildren's\ngeneration,
they really started to\nhave some integration
into both the economy, the\nsocial fabric of the city,
and polity.
And really, about half\nof them were no longer
living in a so-called\nmarginalized area.
However, the prejudice\nand stereotype
against living in a favela,\nwhere 50% of them still lived,
was so powerful that\ndespite the fact that they
were in universities,\nthat they had
the same level of household\ndomestic appliances
as the average of the entire\nmunicipality of Rio de Janeiro,
they never got to be\ntreated with respect.
They were never treated with\nequal standing under the law.
Killing them was\nnever prosecuted.
There was enormous disregard\nfor the humanness and dignity
of these human beings\njust because they
lived in a favela\nat the time when
over these\ngenerations, prejudice,
their experience of being\ndiscriminated on for dark skin
just started going\naway and lightening up.
At the end, the kids didn't\nfind it a huge discrimination,
or being women, or\nbeing anything--
but living in a favela, yes.
It was the biggest\nsource of their
being discriminated for\njobs or anything else.
So then I wrote my\nsecond book, Favela,
which talks about these\nmany longitudinal study,
many generations.
And the recent thing\nI wanted to report on
was that I've been studying\nthe effects of the Olympics,
the World Cup and the Olympics,\non the favela communities
and what has happened in\nthese last three years.
So now there was a new excuse.
Getting ready,\ncleaning up the city
for these mega events opened\nthe doors to the unthinkable
return of favela removal and\nunthinkable occupation 24/7
of military police living\ninside the favelas,
carrying guns and using them\nand using their bullying power
at will, which ended up\nincreasing violence in the city
and ended up removing\nanother 177,000
people under the excuse of\ngetting ready for the Olympics.
So it was kind of\nback to the future.
I don't have time to tell\nyou about the interplay
between research and\npractice and public policy.
So I'll skip that and go\nright to my lessons learned.
OK.
So I'll talk later\nabout the 25-year lag
time between knowledge creation\nand research and public policy.
But I'll go right\nto what I learned
in these 50 years of work.
One-- it's extremely\ndifficult to change people's
attitudes, perceptions,\nand belief systems.
They are very, very\ndeeply entrenched.
And media can fan these\nfears and these images
very easily, as we just saw.
Two-- it's even more difficult\nto change people's behavior.
You might even open\ntheir minds a little,
but changing their behavior is\nvery, very much more difficult.
Three-- it's even more difficult\nto change public policy.
And four-- it is more\nand more and more
difficult to change the way\npublic policy is implemented.
So I've seen the\nwords and public
policy get to be perfect--
citizen participation,\nmonitoring and evaluation,
community control, community\ndecision making, arrangements
with the government to hold\naccountable, blah, blah--
nothing.
When it gets down to the\nimplementation on the ground,
the projects are delayed.
It's easier to remove them, put\na public housing project there.
We started too late, no time\nfor baseline evaluation.
Forget the citizen\nparticipation, too.
So I put to us the challenge\nof this sentence that I also
have in a cartoon\nin my PowerPoint
that someone drew\nfor me, a Brazilian.
And it shows a guy\ndrawing a little plant.
And then it says, to plan is\nhuman, to implement divine.
And then it shows him watering\nthe plant and [inaudible] it.
And so to end up, the new\nbook that I'm working on now
is called the\n[speaking portuguese],,
The Importance of Personhood.
And it's all about\nthe bottom line,
is whether we can\ntreat the other
as a human being with\ndignity who is not invisible,
who is a creator and\nproducer of culture
and intellectual\ncapital, not a consumer
of the intellectual\ncapital and culture
that the elite is producing.
Thank you very much.
[applause]
Well, thanks, Janice, and to\njust put another blunt point
to it, what if the pathology\nis not intrinsic to the slums
but it's actually part and\nparcel of our reaction to them
and part and parcel\nof the way we
refuse to bridge the kind\nof gulf of otherness, which
is very often reinforced by the\nimages we produce in our films,
in our media, in our\nnews, that tell us
that we do not want\nto cross a bridge?
Because we can only do\nit with a guide, right?
So we have a couple of\nminutes for questions
if there's anybody\nwith burning questions.
And we have a couple of\nmicrophones out there.
Let's try to keep them quick.
This is probably a response to\nMac's bluntness, provocation.
Do you think it's fair--
I'm interested in\nall of your reactions
to this-- do you think\nit's fair to think
of slums as actually a vehicle\nfor socioeconomic mobility?
In my experience,\nslums are often
places where there's incredible\nentrepreneurship, innovation.
It provides investment\nopportunities
for families, low\nincome families,
to invest outside of the\nformal economy in their homes.
Granted, there's a\nlack of basic services.
Do you think that's a\nfair way to view slums?
Or is somehow that neglecting\nsome intrinsic problems
that we should be addressing?
Well, my answer is I think\nit is a fair depiction.
And I think Sheila and\nothers that are part of this
will say yes.
In fact, these are\nthriving areas of both
of shelter and commerce.
And in Dharavi, what\ndo they produce--
20-something percent of\nthe GDP of Mumbai, right?
I think we take a few questions.
[inaudible]
Just to say quickly\nthat I think the answer,
like in so many of these\nthings, is yes and no.
That is, that it's absolutely\nclear every place I've ever
been that these are oftentimes\nthe only way that people who
come from regions where they\ndon't have an economic future
can find social mobility,\ncan get their kids in school.
And you see, really\nover the 120 years,
you see remarkable\nsocial mobility.
And people struggle for it.
And they fight for it.
And it's the battle\nof their lives.
But this is where the point\ngets to take our focus away
from these as separate spaces\nand think of them as connected
to larger structures.
Because how much\nwould that energy
be rewarded more\nif these were not
places that were stigmatized\nby the vulnerabilities that
come along with not\nbeing legally sanctioned?
People pay costs\nfor informality,
even as informality\ngives them opportunity.
And so the problem is\nnot the slum itself.
The problem is the\nburden of vulnerability
that is placed on\nthat neighborhood
by being called informal,\nby being called illegal,
by being called a slum.
So that's what I\nwould leave with.
Right, and the people say, look\nhow much they can do with $50.
Look how much they\nmade happen with $150.
They don't say,\nimagine what they could
do if you gave them real money.
It's just like, well, they\ncan get along on so little.
And they make so much of it.
So that's sort of to\nfollow up what you said.
Do we have any other\nburning questions?
I think you're all\nas stunned as--
There's a question.
Alex has a question.
First of all, a wonderful\nevening you're providing us--
I go back to cinema because\nI think what I'm hearing
and also what I'm seeing and\nwhen I look at this problem
historically, especially\nin the United States,
is that conception creates\nall sorts of obstacles
to improvement.
And so I'd like to go back to\nthe idea of the complexity,
the community, all those\nkinds of things that might
have been in the early cinema.
And of course, that's\na kind of trope
also, to find the\nauthentic [inaudible]
what you see in early\nAmerican cinema as well.
But anyway, the question\nwould be, is there a way
or are there filmmakers who\nwould take a different angle
and not take this\ndichotomy that was
so obvious in your\noriginal aerials,
where it's always\nthis versus that,
and get at the complexity\nand the interconnection
of urban life?
Because we just said,\nthese are cities.
And some of the parts of\nthe city look like this.
Some parts look like that.
We'd have a whole\ndifferent story to tell.
So that would be my question.
It's on.
Just--
OK.
So the thing about\ncinema is that--
and this is a question\nthat's posed all the time
to filmmakers-- because\ncinema approximates
the illusion of reality.
So it's seen as a vehicle\nof representation.
It's not representing.
None of these films\nare representing
any authentic reality.
They are entering\nthis universe of what
they imagine urban\nlife is to produce
a different kind of expression.
So I would like us to think\nabout cinema, these expressions
of an experience.
It's not about capturing\nauthentic reality,
which is why I started\noff by saying that this
is a different form\nof knowledge that
has no relationship directly\nwith sociology, economics.
It's about affect.
It's about bodily sensation\nand that sensorium.
And I think the way in which\nthese last two films, City
of God, and the fact\nthat it disturbs,
for me is the great\nsuccess of these two films,
that it tends to disturb.
And if you see\nBunuel's film, 1959,
that is also really\ndisturbing because there's
no place for us to escape into\nfeeling a sense of pathos.
And for me, that's\nthe key question here.
What these agency?
These are all people\nwho are agents of what
they are doing in these films.
So in that sense, the\ndepiction of the world
of the slum in\nwhich we feel we can
capture the complexity, to me\nseems like a bit of a myth.
It's not really possible.
That's the whole\npoint of these films,
is that even when\nthey're at ground level,
you can't see everything.
And from an aerial\nperspective, you
see even less of what\nthat experience is.
So it's the density\nof this ecology.
It's not about\ncapturing a vision.
But it's about understanding\nthis what is this ecology?
It is dense.
It is difficult.\nAnd it is complex.
So as a practitioner and in\nseeing world cinema and the way
that world cinema has\ninteracted with all
these different\ngeographical territories
and tried to deal\nwith these questions,
it's always this difficulty,\nthe problems of vision.
No, it's about the limits\nof vision and what you can
and cannot capture.
And that arrogance--\nfilms, cinema
will have even less\nthan academics.
Filmmakers cannot\nwork that arrogance,
that I will show it all to you.
That's the whole myth\nof the concept city
versus the labyrinth\nin city, that you
feel that you can\ntranscend to a point
from where you can\nactually illuminate.
But there is that tension\nthat runs throughout.
And that is the tension\nthat these films capture.
So it's that\ntension that I think
is very interesting for us to\nthink about these questions.
And though I feel that\nsome people saw City of God
as disturbing, and\nSlumdog Millionaire
was really trashed in India,\nall for the wrong reasons.
There was some vague nationalism\nthat came to the fore.
And suddenly, there\nwas total denial.
India doesn't have slums.
This is what we saw in\nall the newspapers--
total denial.
So for me, it was an event.
These are events.
Film should be seen--\nthese kinds of film
should be seen as political,\nsocial events that
open a world of\ndebate and discussion.
And it also makes us confront\nsome things about ourselves
also as spectators.
We are comfortable about\nseeing it in a certain way.
And when doesn't go\nin that direction,
then we are disturbed.
And so that judgment\ncomes very easily.
And that's why-- and I've got\ninto trouble about this many
times--
I do believe that the\naesthetics of violence
is a very powerful mode today.
And unless we\nrecognize what it's
doing, how violence is actually\ncommunicating something,
it will be difficult\nfor us to understand
what is actually shifted in\ncinema in the recent past.
So I think that's, for me,\nit's important to really think
about the tension and\nnot feel that this is
a problematic representation.
Because it's not\ntrying to represent.
It's trying to introduce us to\na tension that exists over here.
And then think about,\nwhat is this space?
Because I cannot really,\nas a film studies scholar,
I cannot immediately have\na relationship to policy.
Neither can I have\na relationship
to total knowledge.
Because I know the\nkind of myth-making
that goes on in\nthe world of cinema
and in the world of the academy.
So the fact that there is\nthat total knowledge possible,
that desire--
that desire needs to be\nalso questioned a little.
That total illumination is\nsomething that we can achieve.
I would like to leave it as\nincomplete and [inaudible]..
Which is our goal all along, to\ncreate tension and dissonance
and to provoke.
And I think this conference\nis off to an auspicious start.
So we'll have to end there.
We're definitely out of time.
I really, really\nthank you for coming.
I hope you help me\nthank our panelists
for a stimulating discussion.
