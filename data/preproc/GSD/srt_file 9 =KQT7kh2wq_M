Good evening.
It's great to see so\nmany of you here tonight.
I want to once again\nwelcome all the DDes,
MDes, MDE admitted students\nwho are here with us tonight
to this talk, of\ncourse as well as
all of our current students,\nfaculty, and friends.
It's been a really\nbusy day today.
I think the energy\naround the building
has been very palpable,\nand I hope that all of you
have had a really great day.
I just want to\nstart by mentioning
a couple of forthcoming\nevents on Monday of next week
at the same time here in Piper\nwe have the British architect
Amanda Levete--
who has recently won\nthe Stirling Prize--
will give a talk.
And then that will be followed\nthe next evening, on April 10,
again at 6:30--
we have the annual\nJohn T. Dunlop lecture,
which this year is\ngoing to be delivered
by Raphael Bostic, who is the\npresident and CEO of Federal
Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
And Raphael will be discussing\nthe future of fair housing.
Which, this year marks\nthe 50th anniversary
of the passage of\nFair Housing Act.
It's really wonderful to be able\nto welcome Jeanne Gang to give
tonight's lecture.
As most of you know, Jeanne is\na really incredible architect
currently practicing\nin Chicago and New York
where her offices\nare, and of course
doing projects in\nmany other locations.
She is a MacArthur\nfellow, which is also
something very, very,\nvery, very rare,
and is the founding principle\nof Studio Gang, an architecture
and urban design practice.
She is also a member\nof the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences and was\nnamed as [speaking french]
[chuckles]
Which is really wonderful.
[laughter]
I was wondering whether\nI should say that
or not, but since she\nhas the title you have
to persevere with my agony.
Jeanne is internationally\nrenowned for her design process
that foregrounds\nthe relationship
between individuals,\ncommunities,
and the environment.
She has an incredibly\ndiverse body of work
at a multiplicity of scales.
And you've seen this\nwork represented
through such examples\nas the Aqua Tower,
the Arcus Center for\nSocial Justice Leadership,
and the Writer's Theater.
She's currently\ndesigning major projects
throughout the\nAmericas and Europe,
including the Gilder Center\nfor Science Education
and Innovation at the American\nMuseum of Natural History
in New York, Unified Campus\nfor California College of Arts
in San Francisco, and\nthe new United States
Embassy in Brasilia, in Brazil.
With each one of these projects\nthere is enormous effort,
I think, in her practice to\ncombine research investigations
with the design of the projects.
And there's really a\ngreat deal of focus
on the way in which\nmaterials are used
and the sources of\nthose materials.
So there is actually a\ngreat deal of connection
to the investigation of the\nmaterials and techniques
of construction, as well\nas the social capacities
and capabilities and\ncontributions of her projects.
She is a recipient of\nthe 2013 National Design
Award, which is given by the\nCooper Hewitt Smithsonian
Design Museum.
Jeanne was also named a\n2016 Architect of the Year
by the Architectural Review.
In 2017 she was honored with\nthe Louis Kahn Memorial Award
and made an honorary fellow\nof the Royal Architectural
institute of Canada.
Widely published and\nacclaimed, her work
has been exhibited at the\nVenice Architecture Biennale,
and it will be again this\ncoming summer at the Chicago
Architecture Biennale--
or biennial--\nMuseum of Modern Art
and the Art\nInstitute of Chicago.
She's also published a number\nof books on her practice
and on ideas related\nto her practice.
We're very proud of\nthe fact that she
is a graduate of this\nschool, and was recently
appointed professor in\npractice here at the GSD.
Would you please join me\nin welcoming Jeanne Gang?
[applause]
Thank you so much for\nthat nice introduction.
I also want to say\nhi to and recognize
Claire Cahan and Johanna Faust\nwho are here from my office
today, and also to the students\nfrom our studio for the option
studio after the storm.
See you guys.
And so today I wanted to\ntalk about the practice,
about the research\naspects of the practice,
and about thinking about\ndesign through practicing
and research.
A little bit about\nthe practice is
that we started out in Chicago\nand have grown that practice
to about 85 people there.
But there's a strong culture\nwithin the office that
is really based on\ncollaborating and working
with our hands and our\nminds and working together.
So as we grew and\nkind of spread out--
we actually have an\noffice in San Francisco
now, a small one, and\nNew York and Chicago.
We started to-- we\ngrew our practice
to collaborate across\nthe different cities.
So it's not isolated\nin each one.
And we still do a\nlot together, even
though we're on different--\nthe three separate coasts.
And one of the things\nthat we like to do
is to pick up on issues that\nare pertinent of our time,
and things that are\ninteresting to us,
and sometimes make a\nproject that doesn't really
have a client.
And so this was one\nof those projects.
It ended in a book, but\nthere's some research work
from the GSD students\nin it as well.
This book is called Reverse\nEffect, which was really
about-- it was time to\ncome out with some policy
discussions that were going\non in Chicago about whether
or not to clean wastewater\nbefore it was entered back
into the river system.
There is a lot of different\nproblems with the Chicago River
system, and so our\nwork in the book
was to try to explain\nthose, because it's
somewhat complicated.
There's very poor water quality.
There's a lot of flooded\nbasements because
of the hydrology system.
There's the threat of invasive\ncarp coming up the Mississippi
River, threatening to\nenter into the Great Lakes.
And then there's a lot\nof post-industrial fabric
along the river, which\nis of great potential.
About 100 years ago\nthese canals were built.
And this is what reversing\nthe Chicago River refers to.
The red lines are\ncanals that basically
took the water from emptying\nfrom the lake into the rivers,
and did the reverse.
Made the-- [chuckles] The\nrivers were going into the lake,
and now the lake\ngoes into the rivers
and ultimately across this\nsub-continental divide, joining
up with the Des Plaines\nRiver and ultimately
the Mississippi River, ending\nup in the Gulf of Mexico.
And that was in order\nto preserve the drinking
water that was getting polluted\nfrom all of these dumping
into the rivers.
That solution, of course, 100\nyears ago was a fine solution.
But today we know\nthat that's just
delaying the pollution\nto downstream
and messing up someone\nelse's water system.
So we wanted to\nexplain that part
and to also ask people how they\nwere using the river today.
So a real integral\npart of our practice
has become working with\ncommunity members, people,
individuals, the public, and\nreally speaking with them
and finding out their\nideas and attitudes,
more like an industrial\ndesigner would
do for a problem than\ntypically an architect.
But I think it should change.
I think architects and urban\ndesigners and landscape
architects should all\nbe very well-connected
to the communities that\nthey're designing in.
But the most interesting thing\nthat came out of the book
was kind of a design\nseries of steps
of how to undo this big\nproblem of the reversed river
and ultimately clean the water\nand put it back into the lake.
About two billion gallons\nare taken out every day just
to dilute the sewage that ends\nup getting flushed downstream.
Step number one of this diagram\nwas really about giving people
access to the riverfront,\nand that the city should
take steps to make it possible.
Given the fact that most of this\nindustrial fabric was private,
it was very hard for people\nto access that riverfront.
And so this was one of the\nrecommendations in the book.
The interesting thing\nabout this book--
like I said, it was kind\nof aimed at the public,
but it had a lot of\ninteresting research inside--
but it was picked up\nby the mayor of Chicago
before he was mayor,\nand the ended up really
taking on the\nriver as a project.
And since he has\nbeen the mayor he's
also done a number of projects,\nthe Riverwalk downtown
and a number of\nboathouses, of which we
designed a couple of them.
So this boathouse really is the\nidea that we were going for,
which was to give people\naccess to the river,
give them a program, give a\npiece of architecture that
would make it exciting\nto go to the river.
And we designed two of\nthese very minimal cost,
but two projects\nthat really create
an access point and\na place for youth
to engage with this water.
Even though it's polluted,\nand if you fell in you
would probably want to\ntake a bath afterwards.
But the river would\nnot have these stewards
unless people could care\nabout it and go there.
So the building--\nwe really wanted
to harness some of\nthe energy of rowing.
We looked at these Muybridge\nphotographs of rowers moving,
and the movement of these oars.
And then tried to\ntranslate that into a roof
form with a v-shape roof\nand an m-shape roof of very
simple trusses that\nthat could somehow
let light in from the south\nand help our sustainability
performance for the building.
Here it is under construction.
And you can see it's very simple\nmaterials, very simple wood
studs and metal studs.
Everything is straight,\nbut when they come together
it creates kind of a\nvaulted, warped roof surface.
And they have,\nlike, a rowing tank
for the winter, inside rowing.
But for me, seeing\nthis-- it's just
super-exciting to see people\nusing the river, in this case,
for a regatta and kind of\nreengaging it in a way that
hadn't been done before.
This is a building\nmade with slate.
They asked us to do a masonry\nbuilding, but we said--
slate is kind of masonry.
But we needed\nsomething that could
wrap all the surfaces that\nwere so complex once you have
this warped roof structure.
In the second floor\nof the field house--
this is a Vierendeel truss\nthat you kind of-- you're
inhabiting the attic.
The programs they have there\nthough are really great.
They have rowing, teaching\nrowing to veterans,
they have after-school\nrowing programs.
A lot of the space is really\nmeant to support the community
and support kids'\nafter-school learning, support
community gatherings.
This one is being used for yoga\nnow in the mornings, and just
a lot of different activities.
So it ends up being\nmore than a boathouse.
This is the second one\nthat we just finished.
And so this whole idea\nof creating a project out
of a book or an\nidea is something
that's really interesting.
It's a way for an\narchitect, I think,
to take control of\nyour own destiny.
We call it "actionable idealism"\nbecause we are idealistic
and we want to see\nprogress on our projects.
And another one that's\na little bit similar
where we expanded the\nbrief from what was given
is the Nature Board Walk\nat Lincoln Park Zoo.
And again-- so you\ncan see that there
is a real strong attention\nto environment and care
about environment in\nboth of these projects.
This was on a pond.
It was kind of a 19th-century\nversion of a pond that
was about three feet deep.
Had this historic\nbuilding on it,
the idea that you would\nbe reflecting on nature
and looking at it but not\nreally engaging with it.
And this place had kind\nof rundown over the years,
so the zoo wanted us to\nbuild a pavilion there
that would be really\nattractive and kind of reflect
on their mission.
What we said was, it's not\njust about the pavilion.
It really is the entire pond.
We have to look at\nit as an ecosystem
and improve it as a place.
And so working together\nwith landscape architects
and hydrologists, we found that\none of the biggest problems
was just the water quality.
So the biggest effort\non this project
was really turning it into a\nstorm water retention system
and making it a lot deeper so\nthat fish could winter over
in this pond and it could\nsupport a much cleaner--
more oxygen in the water.
This is a view.
You can see that this site is\nreally right in the city, right
along a lake front.
And over the years that\nit's been finished,
we see increased biodiversity,\na lot more people using
the site-- these are\nkind of the early years--
and a really more mature,\nbiodiverse landscape coming
online.
And what's really cool\nabout this project is,
because this place is so\nattractive to insects, animals,
birds, a lot of times\nthey're coming there just
to get this habitat.
Like, it's almost like\nthe zoo without cages,
where animals are\naround volunteering
to show themselves off.
And what I like about\nthat is that they even
started an institute\nat the zoo that is now
studying urban wildlife and\nmonitoring bats and recording
sounds.
And it's become really\na space of science
as well as a place for kids\nto learn about the pond life.
You can see, going\nback-- you know,
we're always looking for data.
How is our work performing?
This one, the number of\nbird species, has increased.
183.
That's from eBird.
You have all these\ndifferent kinds of turtles
there, something\nlike 400 nesting pair
of black-crowned night herons.
I mean, then you\nstart to get into--
you know, you can actually have\nwildlife right in the city.
And what are the conflicts?
I think it's really an\ninteresting question.
We've seen skunk\nrecorded there, coyotes.
There's, like, 2,000 coyotes\npopulating the city of Chicago.
They're actually a very\ngood urban animal--
mammal.
And so this architecture kind\nof helps support that science.
But then we did\ndesign a pavilion,
and actually it took quite\na while to design and not
very long to build.
It was all done with these\npre-fabricated lamellas.
Their material is bent\nin two directions,
so it's like a material\nof glue-laminated
but very, very small\npieces with fiberglass pods
that allow the light\nto be very even inside.
And we just thought of\nit as a flexible space.
It was supposed to be for\neducation, for a class.
But it has just been\nadopted like crazy.
So we see dance groups\ncoming there, yoga again.
A lot of our projects\nattract yoga for some reason.
[laughter]
But at this time we\nreally were thinking--
we started noticing that people\nare getting, like, married
there and--
[laughter]
It's, like, an architecture that\nmakes people kiss each other
and be together.
[chuckles]
And so we thought\nthat, you know,
that is really probably the best\nthing that architecture can do.
Because of our time right\nnow-- which is so polarized--
we need to make spaces where\npeople can mix and intermingle.
One of the things that we\nnever planned for but was
so exciting to see was the site\nused for Diner en Blanc, which
is an impromptu dinner that they\nused the entire boardwalk for.
So I guess what we learned\nfrom these projects,
doing these projects\nis that if you're
trying to support\nthe environment
through your projects it\nreally has to be about people,
supporting people's\ninteractions first.
And if we can't get people\nto agree on what to do,
it won't work.
So another part of our\npractice, in addition
to kind of these\nself-initiated projects that
have to do with writing\nand issues of urbanism,
we've been really interested\nin materials and construction
as well.
An early project that we did was\nan installation in the National
Building Museum.
And it was called\n"The Marble Curtain."
And then, like 10\nyears later we were
asked to do the summer\ninstallation inside this Grand
Hall at the Building Museum.
If you've never been there,\nit's a gigantic space,
enormous space.
One of the qualities of it is\nthat you can't hear someone
talking even if they're,\nlike, five feet away from you.
It's so big and cavernous.
So our idea here\nwas really to create
these domes inside that could\nbe acoustically programmed.
The other installations\nthat had been here before
were all on the ground plane.
They were like a\nmaze, and a beach,
and some things like that.
And we really wanted to do an\narchitectural construction that
is a structure and also\nhave this acoustic benefit.
And so we proposed these hive\nstructures which, at 50 feet,
would be the highest\ninstallation ever done inside
of it.
And we would have to do it\nwithout scaffolding, and in two
weeks' time installation.
And so it was a real\nchallenge to design.
It really just started with very\nsmall-scale models, materials
that we had around the office.
And we very gradually scaled up.
We needed a connection that\ncould be done really quickly.
So we were looking at\nthese slotted connections
for the tubes.
This is still not--
you know, this is a\nsmall scale and looking
at how we could get a wall\nthat would be structural
using the curvature.
And because it is a structure,\nit has to be analyzed
and it has to stand up and\nbe over people's heads.
So a significant part of it\nis structural engineering
and testing.
There is no data\navailable on paper tubes,
to be crushed in\nthis way that they
had to withstand because\nthey had to basically crush
at 3,700 pounds.
We found, though-- this\nwas at Columbia Univeristy
where they tested it.
It got up to 17,000 pounds.
So it was about 4.6 times\nstronger than was expected.
And again, just keeping--
the material is paper, so it's\na nice recyclable material.
The silver part is just the last\npiece of paper on the outside,
and the pink part is the first\npiece of paper on the inside.
So these mockups\nreally helped us
to work through details\nand construction
that then went into\nthe major dome spaces.
And it was just amazing to\nsee this thing come together.
It wasn't perfect in terms of\nhow easily it went together.
Of course it became\nused for yoga again.
[laughter]
I mean, this one was really\njust a mecca for yoga.
I mean, you wouldn't believe it.
[continued laughter]
But inside there were also\nlots of really rowdy parties.
Like they had dance parties\nand music, and lectures,
and all different things\nthat could take advantage
of the acoustics of the space.
Which is a lot like--
it worked kind of like if you\nwere in a clearing in a forest,
where you have cylindrical\ntrees around you.
And let's say a\nclearing-- you would
get this sound bouncing around.
It really worked quite well.
So we've been devoting\npart of our practice
to these kind of installations.
One benefit is, they\nget built quickly.
So people in the\noffice get to work
on something that's done,\nwhereas some projects
we have take 10 years to build.
So we've been-- and they're\nalso these things that
inspire people to be together.
And we really like that part.
There's tall buildings as well.
Now, how do you make tall\nbuildings more social?
And there are more\nand more projects
that we are getting,\nas the cities become
more vertical, that are tall.
And so we like the idea\nof increasing the density
and reducing carbon with a\nsmaller footprint in the city.
We don't like the idea\nof people not connecting
in tall buildings.
Because a lot of times\nthey're very off-putting.
So one of the first\nprojects we did
was the Aqua Tower, which\nhas these balconies.
And the whole idea\nof the balconies
was to create a\nkind of topography
on the outside of the\nbuilding that would--
like hills and valleys\nthat would allow people
on the building to see\nthe landscape around
and to see landmarks, but\nalso to see each other.
The nice side-benefit\nis, they really
help to ameliorate the wind.
This is a shot from\nthe wind-tunnel.
And with the research\non tall buildings--
you know, we started\nit out-- it's
just a requirement to do\nwind-tunnel testing so that you
can see the loads\non the building
and design the\nbuilding structure.
But it's also about the social\nspace around the building, too,
and making that comfortable.
But now, you know, it's\ngetting more advanced
and we're using it\nmore as a design tool.
With this building it was really\nabout seeing the neighbors
and being part of\nthe city and being
part of the building\nat the same time.
And we did hear that\npeople are getting together
in the building.
They're starting to meet and\nit's a very social building.
And there's lots\nof groups that are
formed in that building\nthat are unlike a lot
of other tall buildings.
But the balcony seems\nto be a place where you
can make this social happen.
This is another building\ncalled "City Hyde Park"
where we tried to improve the\nperformance of the balconies
here.
And if you can see, the model\nover here on the right--
each balcony is its own stem.
And the gravity loads from\nthat stem come all the way down
to the ground.
And then it can just\ntouch back lightly
to the rest of the building.
And that lets us do the\nthermal break, which
we couldn't get into at Aqua.
So this is an image of the\nthermal break between where
the balcony on the left and\nthe inside space on the right.
And we've actually installed\nin this building monitoring
equipment.
So some of the units\ndon't have a thermal break
and other ones do,\nand we're testing.
Because we always hear that\nthis is the most important thing
in buildings.
And frankly, I am starting to\ndoubt it because of the data
that we're getting back.
So we're going to\npublish something on that
in the tall buildings research.
But these balconies\nreally have a very nice
three-dimensional\nquality, and allow people
to step outside and be\nalmost like a threshold zone
where it's like a porch\nor something where
it's not thought of as a totally\nprivate space on the balcony.
You can't see into\nother people's units,
but you can see other people on\ntheir balconies in a major way.
I mean, the thing is, like--
I mean, there's so many\ninteresting spaces on this.
And we actually-- this\nside of the building,
which faces south--
the balcony stems\nalso provide shading.
And the front side of the\nbuilding that looks north
has the skyline.
Everyone thought that the north\npart would rent rent out first.
This is a rental building.
But the south part did.
And it was just--
No.
I always thought it would\nbe like, OK, introverts
on the north, social\npeople on the south.
[laughing]
But everybody wanted to\nbe on the south, which
was very interesting.
So I think this balcony is\nan interesting piece of this,
as kind of a\nresearch that's very
particular to\nresidential high-rise
that we're continuing with.
It's also about materials\nand construction.
But I think one of the\ntools that we learned
from these taller\nbuildings is really
how to work with that wind\ntunnel as a design tool.
So I wanted to show a\ncompetition that we recently
did.
And I think it's safe\nto say that competitions
are design research,\nespecially when you don't win.
It goes into the research pile.
[laughter]
But this one we\ngot second place,
and it was very, very close.
But this is for a really\ninteresting problem
that is now coming\nup a lot more,
which is to re-clad and redefine\ntall buildings that are really
coming to the kind of year\nthat their skin is failing.
A lot of them have asbestos.
Tour Montparnasse was--\nit's about 210 meters,
and it was built--
it was finished in, I\nthink it was in '73,
and it was designed by a\nconsortium of three architects
and an American firm as well.
Three French architects\nand an American firm.
And it was an urban\nrenewal project,
and it's really the only thing\nof its scale around there.
This is just a\nlittle map that shows
you the footprint\nof the building,
the train station, and then this\nincredibly windy, uncomfortable
plaza that is in front of it.
So on this\ncompetition we thought
our approach would\nbe, how could we
change the building\nin its second life
to reduce the\ndiscomfort on the plaza.
So that was kind of\nthe starting point.
Like, it turns out\nthat this shape,
which is a really weird shape--
it shoots the air straight down.
It\'s kind of referred\nto as a "downwash"
in the wind-tunnel business.
But it shoots the wind\nright down to the plaza.
And I have experienced.
It is very, very\nuncomfortable there.
But the whole idea\nof the wind tunnel
owes a lot to the\nFrench engineering--
an engineer,\nEtienne-Jules Marey,
who really did some of the\nfirst wind tunnel studies.
I happened to see\na show of his--
maybe it was 10\nor 15 years ago--
and stumbled upon these\nincredible models that
were wind tunnel models\nusing smoke to reveal
the vortices and so on.
So one of the issues\nabout tall buildings
is, you use fluid\ndynamics to understand
how to size the\nstructure, but also what's
happening to the environment\naround the building.
So for Tour Montparnasse-- we\nsee that red part right there--
that was that wash going down.
And so our idea was to--
at the same time of\nimproving this floor plate
to make it bigger, but also\nmix the use of the building--
but try to work on\nthe wind performance.
I've really been interested in\nnature and a lot of the things
that you find out about\nengineering through nature.
And one of the things\nthat's really pretty recent
is that these bumps on the\nflippers of humpback whales--
they actually have\na purpose, which
is to reduce the vortex\nshedding and to make
them more fluid dynamic.
So there's this\nidea of bumpiness
that's coming into--\nwhich wasn't there.
In buildings we're\nway far behind,
let's say, airplane design\nand other industrial designs.
But so the idea to\nfill out the floorplan,
and then to create\nthese bumpiness which
would reduce the\nloads on the building,
reduce the amount of steel\nthat the building has,
and reduce a vortex\nshedding and the downwash.
So we actually were testing\na lot of these things
before we had the project.
We were doing it\nin the wind-tunnel,
this one up in Canada.
And you can see right\nhere, putting one
of the models on this plate.
And then that goes\nup into the chamber.
So the picture on the\nright is a chamber
with a model of Paris around it.
I also thought that this--\nthinking about Marey
again-- it's these stopgap\nimages, a lot like what we were
looking at in the boathouse.
That's fascinating.
And so our concept\nreally started
with this idea of structure.
Like, we had to\nhave more structure
to hold up a brand-new\nfacade that's
much heavier than the\none that was there.
We needed new glass.
And why not have like 1,000\nbelvederes on the building
where everybody has a corner?
And then we get this bumpiness\nand we get this new skin that
would really perform as well.
And so we ended up\ndesigning this double skin--
a thin, double-skinned facade\nwith an internal blind.
And this would be a\nreflective material.
And the cool thing\nabout it is, if they're
automated you would\nget this response
to the sun and the overheating,\nand it would actually
become a reflective\nbuilding, but in a way
that would be moving and alive.
And I think that's one of\nthe things most missing
on the Tour\nMontparnasse right now.
It just doesn't feel very alive.
And we found, by doing this--\nthis is a simulation that--
you know, you could\nhave one shade down,
and the other open so you still\nmaintain the views because
of these bumps.
So we had a better shading\nperformance, and really
a kind of very nice new\nlife for the building
with a kind of a\nhuman scale to it that
relates more to the context.
And so it would have this\nkind of-- if you look
at the different--
as it's changing,\nresponding to the light,
it would have these different\nmoving quality to it.
The social spaces\nlike the lobby--
these are the new columns\ncoming down and spreading out
away from the foundation.
Very technically\nchallenging project.
Lots of new uses in\nthe ground level,
with a bigger footprint\nat the ground.
Breaking up the wind down there\nwith wider spaces, terraces.
Really starting to make more\nconnections to the program,
inside and out, with some\nco-worked space and connection
to the observatory.
So all of the uses\nwere supporting this.
And also at the top an idea\nabout this structure, this
[inaudible] that would go up\nand out and capture the glass.
So we would have an enclosed\nroof garden as opposed
to the open air one\nthey have currently.
But it also has decks outside.
So it was really thinking\nabout the building
in a totally\ndifferent way for us,
because we didn't have a\nclient in a certain way.
It was a competition, and\nwe were free to experiment
with all these things.
I'm just going bring it\nback down in scale now
to a more manageable scale.
The Arcus Center for\nSocial Justice Leadership.
I really like this project\nbecause it is based on--
they wanted us to\nhelp break down
these boundaries\nbetween people that
are coming together\nto learn how to be
leaders in social justice.
And it's on a small campus in--
Kalamazoo College.
Small campus in Michigan\ndominated by this kind of--
to me it's colonial.
I know there's history\nprofessors in here about
colonial architecture.
And I was just\nthinking, we can't
match this colonial architecture\nwith the Social Justice Center.
That would be really bad.
[laughter]
So we had a good excuse to\nnot do a traditional building.
Not that we would anyway.
But what is a Social\nJustice Center?
We didn't know.
And we started to look at\nthe spaces of social justice.
Where does it happen?
It happens in the streets.
You know?
it's in the public spaces.
There isn't really a typology\nfor a social justice center.
So we looked there.
Then we thought about\nDr. King and, like,
where did the plan\nthese marches.
And a lot of times it was, you\nknow, around a kitchen table
or in the basement of a church,\nin very more small spaces.
And we looked at\nplaces around the world
where meeting houses, community\nmeeting houses a lot of times
are focused inward so\npeople can face each other.
I think it's really\nimportant when
you want to have a\nconversation to face someone.
So it sounds simple.
The one on the upper left is\nin Mali, and that one even
has a low roof so people stay\nseated and face each other when
the elders meet.
And it keeps people from\nstanding up and taking
over the meeting.
We did put this meeting\nspace right in the middle
with a hearth, which is not that\neasy in an academic building
to have an open fireplace\nand a kitchen as well.
Because food was another\none of those things
that breaks down these\nbarriers between people.
So it can be used-- this\nbuilding is flexible.
It's open.
It has meeting spaces\nwithin it, but it
can be used for small\nor large-scale meetings
and conferences.
It has some study spaces\nand some offices in it.
And it has seminar rooms--
the small one and a larger one\nthat looks out onto this grove.
So it started from\nthe inside out.
But from the outside\nit really had
to address these three\ndifferent contexts.
One was the grove.
The other one was the campus.
And finally, just\nthis neighborhood,
which is across the street,\nof residential houses.
So as we were\ndeveloping this concept,
we wanted to also make it maybe\nuse a wood structure or wood
cladding on the building\nto connect it to the grove.
And we found the white cedar\nis really good from Michigan.
It's rot-resistant and\nit's insect-resistant.
And we also stumbled\nupon this amazing barn
when we were driving up\nand back to Michigan,
and it was over 100 years old.
And it had this wood masonry,\nwhich I had never seen before.
And we were so intrigued\nwith this we thought,
what if we could bring\nthis technique back?
You know, that would be amazing.
So we looked all around\nto find if anyone
knew how to do wood masonry, and\nwe discovered this couple that
had been going around and\nteaching people how to do it,
mostly for, like,\na personal sauna
or something in the backyard.
And we asked them to\ncome to our office
and we asked them to\nteach us how to do it
and to teach our masons\nhow to do it as well.
And it turns out, it's\nsuch a great technique
because you're really absorbing\nall this carbon in the tree's
life, the tree's\nreleasing oxygen,
but you're not\nover-processing this wood.
It's just drying out.
And you're using all the\nwood, all the different sizes
of the tree.
So we just brought some\n21st-century techniques here,
like the pre-sorting\nso the masons don't
have to think about it.
Other things-- the insulation\nquality is very high.
And we also did a lot of\ntesting on the aesthetics of it,
because it can\nlook pretty crude.
But we were able to make\nthis incredible wall that's
so textured and connected\nto the idea of masonry,
but also something new.
So these three\ncurved walls also do
something in that they put\nthe wood into compression
in the arc.
So that's also a good thing\nfor this type of building.
We imagined it\nweathering differently
on the different\nsides, which it has.
This is one of the--
we tried this window, which\nis this kind of eyebrow window
sideways, and it's got\namazing weathering on it.
But really a long,\nvery enduring technique
that expresses this idea of\ncommunity inside and out.
I mean, the fact that you\nkind of can do it by yourself
or do it with someone\nis really important.
It even embodies this\nidea of community.
And then the last project\nlike this I wanted to show
is the Writer's\nTheater Project, which
is a small theater on\nthe north side of Chicago
in a kind of suburb\nvillage north of the city.
This just completed\na couple years ago.
It has a 250-seat\ntheater, a thrust stage,
and it has a small\nblack box as well.
It's located here.
That site-- you can\nsee where Lake Michigan
is in the background.
And it is just a\nsleepy little village
where this incredible\ntheater company had located.
They were operating out\nof a back of a bookstore,
and they also were\noperating out of a--
in a lady's library club.
So they were in found spaces,\nand they wanted to kind of move
to the next level.
You know, I think one\nof the things we really
like if a project comes\nin front of us is,
when the organization is\ntrying to use architecture
to become the next\nthing that they can be.
So it's almost like design\ncan help an organization
with its identity, and it can\nhelp them advance as well.
So here it was really the case.
But the town is very sleepy.
A lot of people just drove\naround, and not a lot
of pedestrian activity.
So here we were trying\nto tap into this--
I don't know-- the feeling,\nthe spirit of street theater,
theaters that don't\nhave buildings,
or outdoor theaters,\nplaces that engage
the community around them.
You know, during\nthe Elizabethan era
there were these in-yards\nthat were in courtyards,
so people could be on the second\nfloor looking down as well,
and the stage is kind\nof thrust out there.
And then we thought\nof-- maybe this idea
could be a lobby\nor something that
could activate the city and the\ncivic aspect of the project.
So we designed-- so I'm\njust going to talk mostly
about the lobby right now.
It's just this part of the\nbuilding that is on the street
and adjacent to the park\nthat connects to the ground
floor and the second\nfloor, and then
can be used as an impromptu\nstage, a place for talks
before and after the show.
That was another thing.
They really wanted\nthese conversations
to continue after the\ntheater performances.
Which I think theater\nhas a unique quality
in that it can bring\nup difficult issues,
and it gets people talking.
So there just needs to\nbe a space for that.
We tried this again,\nthis vierendeel kind
of truss that's got\na walkway around it.
And the idea here was that the\nwalkway could be at the canopy
level, and it could be a place\nwhere people could go outside
at intermission.
And really, using wood in\nthis way and intention-- it
was a challenge.
You know?
Like, I guess it\ncould have been steel,
but we really wanted it\nto be wood and push wood
to the maximum, to be doing\nwhat it does really well,
which is working intention.
And so to do that we have this--
we called the "cat\'s paw."
It's this connection between the\nbottom of the beam and the wood
battens.
And it's really interesting.
I'll show you a little\nbit more about it.
But we couldn't-- you know,\nfinding people to make these
things is sometimes a challenge.
We found this firm\ncalled "Trillium Dell"
that were located, like, out\nin the middle of nowhere.
I mean, like, nowhere.
Middle of Illinois.
And there's amazing\ncraftspeople working there
with a lot of\nhigh-tech equipment.
We went out there.
We had to because we had to\ntest this detail and the word
intention.
You can see this rig here,\nwhich is pulling the wood apart.
And actually the test is\nover, and it succeeded.
That's why everyone is so happy.
[laughter]
The rig itself started to\nfail, so they stopped the test
and we surpassed the test.
But that connection\nwas really important.
And it's like-- you know, taking\nthe design further than just
what it looks like\nand trying to bring
that concept all the\nway through, I think,
is really a really important\npart about architecture for us.
And here this is inserting\nthese additional wood
into the slats of the\nbottom of the cat paw.
So instead of taking\naway material--
like what you would do if\nyou put a bolt through this--
you're actually\nadding material in.
And this is what it kind\nof looks like up close
after they start to be done.
I got to work on\nsome of these, too.
I mean, it was fun to do it.
And they invited us out there to\ndo stuff in their shop as well.
It was really amazing.
I also learned how\nto throw an ax.
[laughter]
Because that's what you do\nin the middle of Illinois
in the middle of winter when\nthere's nothing else around,
I guess.
But, anyway.
But these are projects\nthat we really
advance our own research.
We engage with a lot\nof different experts
on different things.
And I feel like when\npeople come to the building
they can sense what\nthe structure is doing.
Like, that this is intention.
It's so thin.
You can feel it,\nlike, hanging there.
And it makes really\nnice space outside.
But what's really great\nabout this building, I think,
is that the civic role that we\nintended for it to have it--
it's serving that for\nthe theater company,
but it's also starting to do\nthings that we didn't expect,
which are really exciting.
Like, these steps.
It turns out that kids are\ncoming here after school
and studying on the steps.
And they're opening\nit up and they're
adding a cafe and a restaurant.
So it's starting to\nimprove the city.
The city has had to come\nup with a new ordinance
because there were not enough\nrestaurants in the past,
so they had certain\nthings in their code.
And now there's, you know,\nhalf a dozen restaurants that
have come because\nthis theater is really
starting to promote walkability\nand action in the city.
So it's kind of nice.
And we're trying to find\nthese metrics so that we
can measure these things.
And a lot of it is\ndifficult because it's
qualitative information.
But it's something\nthat I think-- again,
I think that a big part of\nresearch really needs to be
for us-- for all of us--
about why architecture helps\nand how it is successful.
It is the design.
It is everything about it.
And if you don't have the design\npart, it often doesn't work.
So I want to\nunderstand that better.
Finally, just a couple\nof the more urban scale
projects we've been focusing on\nover the last about six years.
And we've even started an urban\npractice within the office.
But it's based on connecting\nurban design and architecture,
so it really always has this\narchitectural scale to it
as well.
So Polis Station\nis a project that
was, again, self-initiated.
It was a reaction\nto what's going
on in the country\nbetween police--
the violence between police\nand community members.
And it was something\nthat-- at the time
we were designing a fire station\nin Brownsville and Brooklyn,
and we noticed that with\nfire stations or fire rescue,
people really like the\nfire rescue workers.
And they actually-- it is kind\nof like a welcoming place.
So we started to wonder, if the\npolice station could possibly
be improved would that help with\nthese difficult relationships?
In Chicago, about\n20 years ago, they
built all these prototype\npolice stations.
And, you know, even\nthough they're modern,
they never really asked anyone\nin the communities what they
wanted in their police station.
They're all identical\nand kind of plopped
on the different sites.
And so we were wondering, if\nwe could look at the history
and ask people about what they\nwanted in a police station,
what would they come up with.
If you look at the history\nof the police stations--
and this is kind of focusing\non the Northeast, I guess--
from Chicago to the\nNortheast-- they were once
not even buildings at all.
They were like little warming\nstations that people would use.
And these were community\nmembers who would just
walk around the\nneighborhood and make sure
that everything was safe.
So they actually came\nfrom the community.
And so what's changed is\nthat the car is introduced.
The police station has become\nsurrounded by parking lots.
So there are even--
this is in Chicago.
They're even more separated\nfrom the community.
And the police don't live there.
In fact, they're not\nlike the communities
that they're policing.
And there's a big, huge distrust\nbetween these two groups.
And so we thought of\ntaking this example, which
is in North Lawndale in Chicago,\nthe 10th district police
department--
I also taught a studio where\nwe looked at the situation
in New York.
But here these gigantic parking\nlots and hugely-wide roads--
130-foot wide-- are working\nto separate the community
from the police station.
And actually people are scared\nto go anywhere near the police
station because they're\nafraid to be injured and shot,
but also afraid to even\ngo in and report a crime.
And so it's really\ndysfunctional in a major way.
So we were able to gather some\ncommunity members from North
Lawndale, and police, and we did\na meeting with the two groups
together.
And we didn't work for\neither one of them.
And we asked them how to\nimprove the police station so
that there would be more trust.
And a lot of this was based\non the recommendations
from the Obama\nAdministration that
came out with a community\npolicing report.
And the things that they came\nup with were really cool.
Like, you know shared--
these would all be on the\npublic side of the station.
Shared compute resources,\nfree Wi-Fi, cafes,
even a barbershop.
The barbershop I like the\nbest, because that would be--
you know, you're basically\ntrying to build connections
between the two\ngroups and have them--
so when police\nare in the street,
they recognize people and\nthey don't just assume--
or, they treat them like people.
And there would\nbe conversations,
and there would be less\nconfrontational interactions.
So the idea that this would\nopen up on the public side
and really be part of\na community center.
What's really cool is\nthat this project--
people have called me from\naround the country that
are implementing these\nthings in police stations
around the country,\nwhich is really exciting.
In ours we raised enough money\nto put these sports courts
on the parking lot and take\naway some of the parking.
That was one of the things\nthat both the police
and the community\nmembers wanted.
But there was some fear about\ngoing near the police station.
But we went back a year\nlater and interviewed people,
and the parents were\nsaying that they really
felt that their kids were safer\nnow playing outside the police
station.
And so I think there's\na very small step,
but there's something in that,\nand that we were you know
showed images of how\nthis thing could really
start to take shape.
And we want to see\nthat advance further.
So finally, last thing\nis just a project
that's in progress right\nnow on the urban scale.
It's the Memphis\nRiverfront Concept Plan.
Memphis is a city on\nthe Mississippi River,
which is an incredible\n2,300-mile river that goes
through these States.
This is Memphis up here\nunderneath the key.
Because this drawing\nis all about the river,
they don't really care that\nthere's a city right here.
But it's an incredible\ndrawing that
shows the change that is\npresent in this river.
And Memphis was once a really\nmajor trading destination,
on par with Chicago.
And it was a historic\nplace that also
has very difficult histories.
And you can see here on the\nriverfront, this space--
we were asked to do\na riverfront plan
that, along the lines of\nthe Polis Station, in fact,
to try to knit together some of\nthe amenities owned by the city
but maybe not being\nfully utilized.
And so we really delved into\na lot of the history here.
The plan we already\nissued, but we're
starting to focus in now\non one piece of it, which
is at the Fourth Bluff area.
And it's a landing\nwhere a lot of the trade
happened and steamships came in.
Cotton was traded.
Slaves worked on the\nsite, so there's this--
different perceptions of\nthis place, in Fourth Bluff.
And we're really\ntrying to understand
this landing in a\nnew way, in looking
at its materials and the\nthings that happened there.
And it's a really very\ninteresting thing.
There's nothing\ngoing on there now.
I think it's about\n800 feet long,
and it has all these different\ntypes of geology, stones
that were coming from upriver--
nine different types of geologic\nmaterial found in the landing.
And it's kind of\nscruffy and it's--
because they really just\ndon't know what to do with it.
And when we started\nthis project it
was right around the time\nwhere Tammy Sawyer was
leading this charge to take\ndown these Confederate statues.
So you've probably read\na lot in the newspaper
the past few days because of the\nanniversary of Dr. King being
assassinated in Memphis.
There's just a\ncharged atmosphere,
and there's a desire\nto move forward.
So what we've started\nthe process of doing
is to think about the landing\nreally as kind of a new,
almost like a horizontal\nmemorial or a marker
for Memphis that would be an\ninclusive memorial or marker.
And it's an idea that--
it seems really strong,\nbut there's no way
we could do it on our own.
We want to engage\npeople, and started
a process of doing that--
to ask them what's\nimportant about Memphis,
and maybe somehow\nget those stories
into the stones on the landing.
So really just in the\nbeginning the process
some of the tools that\nwe're using are interviews.
That's Tammy Sawyer,\nactually, and that's
Heinz, in our office,\nsketching the interviews
and getting the words\ndown that are used,
and recording the sounds\nand walking around
on tours with people to get\nthis really varied story of what
happened there.
So I think the role of\nthe architect in this
is really just to\nbe the listening
party, to not impose ourself\non it at all right now,
and just get the stories.
And then we can start\nto think about how
to translate those into\nthe material that is there
at the landing.
And so I don't know\nwhere it's going to go,
but I hope that you will check\nback in with us at the Venice
Biennale, where\nwe'll be showing some
of the work about this project.
So with that, I'm finished.
[chuckling] Thank you very much.
[applause]
And we can take questions.
Yeah.
Sure.
It would be great if\nyou have some questions.
I mean, maybe I could\njust start with something
a little bit-- just trying\nto contextualize the work.
I mean, I'm sure everyone\nknows that your practice is
quite unusual.
It's not really a kind\nof typical practice
in terms of the\ndiversity of things,
in terms of the relationship\nbetween small-scale and
large-scale, in terms of\nthe way that you're actually
focusing on this material\ndimension, and just
really the whole\nconnection with nature,
with ecology, with waste.
This is probably quite\ndifferent from the experience
that you had working\nat OMA when you first
graduated from the GSD.
So it might be\ninteresting for people
to just know what is\nthe sort of transition
that you went through?
How did it evolve when you set\nup the practice to gradually
kind of end up where you are?
I think something about\nthat kind of history
would be very interesting.
Yeah.
OK.
Well, one of the things\nabout the GSD-- and my thesis
here was really on\nwastewater and how
it could be transferred\ninto clean water,
but also how it\ncould make a space
active in the public realm.
But when I really learned\nfrom working at OMA
was the power of\nprogramming the buildings.
And also there was a more--
at the time, in Europe,\nthe consultants,
engineers that I\nwas working with
were really top ones in\nsustainability and structure.
And they worked for the\nowner in the case of Europe,
whereas in American\nsystem the consultants
were all under the architect.
And so what it did--
that relationship\nthere-- it made
the architect have to\nlisten to the engineer more.
And so it was actually--
which was great for me,\nbecause I love structure.
I mean, my father was\na structural engineer
and I want to get that\ninformation early on.
Because a lot of times I feel\nlike one of the first choices
is, what is the material\nstructure of the building.
So that was a take-away.
And just being around Rem,\nwas is a great thinker,
and working on lots of\nthings simultaneously.
But for me I wanted to create\nan office that would be, well,
frankly indulging the\nthings that I like.
[laughter]
Which are people, the\nenvironment, and materials.
And so I just didn't let\nthe forms that were out
there dictate what\nI was going to do,
and I just followed\nwhat I wanted to do.
Luckily it produced\nsome projects
that allowed me to start the\npractice and to expand it.
But I think now\nI surround myself
with like-minded people that\nalso like these same things,
and we like each other.
And it doesn't mean we don't\ndisagree, but it is a real--
like, a total life experience--
very full-- that I've created\norganically over the years.
And we keep tweaking it\nnow, because it's not just
coming from me.
It's really coming from\nthe whole collective brain
of the whole studio.
And how does that affect the\norganization of the office?
Like, the people that you\nhire or people who work there?
Right.
So it ends up being that--
well, when we started\nto scratch a little bit
into this urban\nspace and realizing
that we didn't have urban\ndesigners in the office, we--
but people wanted to work\non these kind of projects--
we just started to bring\nin people like that.
So, you know, one\nof the first people
was a former client\nfrom the Park
District of the city of Chicago\nwho was an urban designer.
And so, you know,\nstarting to try
to find the right people\nthat we wanted to work with.
And it's an ongoing thing.
So we are always tweaking\nwhat the organization is like.
There's a lot of design thinking\nabout the organization itself.
Like how it can be\nmore effective, how we
can get the projects we want.
And balancing the profit\nprojects with the projects
that make no profit.
[chuckles]
Yeah.
Any questions?
Please.
Hello.
Thank you very much\nfor your lecture.
It was phenomenal.
Big fan here.
How much of your--
just to get inside the\nbusiness model specificities.
One of the things\nthat I notice--
there's a huge\namount of research,
but also human hours,\nquantities of research.
And now you're a\nbig firm, but it
seems that that was the\ncase since early on.
And for in a small firm, this\nis money that it's pouring out
and might not getting in.
Two questions.
How much of your firm there is\non research and development,
like, you put in and\nyou [inaudible] in,
in terms of research unit?
And, how much you did\nbefore and how much
that has changed in\nterms of honest research
that it's paying back?
I think the project--
some of the research\nstarts building up,
and so we had to spend-- we put\ntime into making it accessible
and organized.
We have our own\nlibrary searches,
and we have our own research--
we have software\nthat can allow us
to access the research so new\nteams can always get access
to it.
And with lots of\ntags and keywords
and things that-- it\nmakes it accessible.
And so not every project\nhas to start with as much.
Like, there's always\na basis to start with.
So that's been improved.
But I think as a young\npractice, as starting out,
you're going to be doing more\nresearch in the beginning
probably, because\nyou treat it like
you would a project at school.
Which, I think we just never\ngrew out of the school thing,
I think is what happened.
And we still treat the projects\nin a very similar way to studio
here.
And so it's just more fun\nto work on it like that.
But, yeah.
The balance-- I'm not the\nbusiness genius behind this.
It's just I know what I want\nto do, and then we tried it.
We have people that--
even now we have a chief\nfinancial officer who can--
she helps figure\nout, like, how much
we can put on this or that.
So that's how it--
and it is, like I said,\nconstantly a balancing thing
and trying to tweak\nand make it better.
Good question.
Hi.
Up here.
Thank you so much\nfor the lecture.
So my question is, if you\ncould share to us a little bit
of the constraints\nthat you have faced
as a female architect\non the field
when you bring innovative,\ndifferent types of processes
in design.
So when you show\nthe work in Chicago
and how you are\nbringing the community
and really showing the\ndesign as a process
and you even give the comment\nof how we, as architects, should
be more listeners than anything\nelse, so putting yourself
in a state of total anonymity.
And so I want you to\nshare a bit of that.
And also perhaps suggestions\nas a contribution to our field,
to move forward in that.
Not just as a woman, but\nas an architect in general.
Thank you.
On the process side, I think\nthere is a desire to listen.
But then it also has to be\ncoupled with-- like, it's
pure creative periods.
So a lot of times we are\nin the absorbing mode,
in the research mode.
We definitely turn it off\nand then just go make things.
But my hope is\nthat the knowledge
that we have from listening\nand from studying and doing
the research on other projects--\nit gets into the projects.
But you still have to--
you know, I'm just calling\nattention to the point
that you do have\nto kind of, like,
turn off that mode\nat some point to be
able to make things and be free\nto criticize your own designs.
And so being attentive to\nyour own process, whatever
works for you, is really--
that seems to be\nvery important to us.
We look at our process,\nand we refine it
so that we can be\nmore efficient,
but also do better work.
So, yeah.
And in terms of difficulties--
you know, I never think\nof things as difficulties,
I guess.
Like, if it's\nsomething problematic,
then try to turn it into\nan advantage somehow.
It doesn't always work.
But, yeah.
So usually, if\nyou see a problem,
it can always be looked at\nfrom a different point of view.
And there's something\nto be gained there.
That's just a more\nphilosophical answer,
but I know that it's not easy.
It's not easy all the time.
Thank you.
Really great lecture.
I had a question.
So there's a lot of\nconversations and debates
about how architects can have\na larger impact on a larger
scale in the city.
So, like, how to move beyond\nsimply designing maybe
singular buildings that\nmight be phenomenal
but might have limited impact.
Do you think that the\nexpansion of your practice,
to do projects on an urban\nscale and a larger scale
is sort of a response\nthat sort of arises out
of a desire to have, like, a\nlarger impact within the city?
Oh, I think definitely\nthe idea of--
we want to be--
I think architects are\nuniquely positioned
to be able to take very complex\ndata sets and information
and turn it into\ndesign, which is
what speaks to so many people.
And so it can also help\nmove an issue further along.
And so, yeah.
It's like being an instigator of\nsome things to make it happen.
And maybe you can do\nsomething that will just
push-- nudge it over the edge.
It's a process that--
you can get in trouble\ndoing this, too.
I mean, for example,\nsometimes we've
been threatened\nwith repercussions
for doing certain projects.
But you just can't\nlet it bother you.
You have to do what you\nthink that you want to do
and what you think you can--
I guess in every project\nwe're always trying
to find what is the issue.
Sometimes it might\nbe a technology issue
or a formal issue.
Or, you know, it's not always\na major, strong, public issue.
But trying to find out\nwhat the question is--
that is the important thing.
Like, so how do you frame the\nquestion for your project?
What are you trying to answer?
And if you can set that\nup, which we do here,
which we do in\nstudio all the time--
and that question\nhas to be something
that other people are\ninterested in, too.
So it's not only your\nown personal question.
This is where I probably differ\nfrom a lot of architects.
So I want the question\nto resonate with others.
Other architects\nand other public.
And so then when you\nstart working on that.
And it helps to move\nthe needle, I think.
Out here.
Thank you so much\nfor your lecture.
Oh, hello.
I'm in the staircase.
[laughing]
Oh, hi.
It was really nice to see\nthe amount of research that
goes into your projects\nbefore the design
and building of a project.
But also the effort that\nyou put into actually
prove things, like\nassumptions that were
made during the design process.
So you mentioned\nthermal bridging,
and that might not turn\nout to be as important
as people assume it to be.
Were there other\nassumptions that architects
make quite often that you found\nduring a lot of your projects
that turned out\nto be just untrue?
Hm.
Yeah.
Well, I especially like pushing\nthe limits on materials.
So, like all of those--
like the tubes that have\nto withstand the loads
or the wood that has to\nbe working intention,
those are things--
I think that the materials\nhave a lot of qualities
that they don't get credit for.
So it's just about finding\nthe right application
for that material\nused in that way.
But that is one of the things\nthat I get really excited
about.
But you do find assumptions\nin every category, I guess.
And those are kind of one of\nthe things that you can start
to form your question around.
You know, it's most fun if you\ncan blow away people's mind
when they see your building.
[laughter]
Hi.
Thank you again so\nmuch for your lecture.
I really appreciated it.
So I really-- going through\nall of these pictures of clear
research, of you guys making,\nand clearly being a making
studio, do you find that with\nthe introduction of technology,
when you're starting to\nreally dive into the project--
specifically with the\nskyscraper competition--
do you find a disconnect\nbetween the two?
Or really, how do you merge\nthose in a successful way?
Oh, well, they're\nalready merged.
Because a lot of the\nmaking that we do
is assisted by digital making.
But we do try to\nalways have that--
I think that's,\nagain, one of these--
like, a fetish that\nI have about working
with materials and myself.
And I don't want\nto give that up.
But I think you can study\nthings in both analog
and digital ways.
And we do.
Especially using-- I think\nthe best technology right now
is really the data\nitself, the data
of how you can find information.
Like, we'll do things in\ncities before going in,
and we have so much\ninformation before we
even set foot in the\ncity that you can get.
So that's like a\nreally exciting tool.
And all the other tools as well.
But, like, with the hand-making,\nthere's something between--
for me anyway-- between\nthe brain and the hand
that is just very enjoyable.
You think of ideas that\nyou wouldn't otherwise
get to, maybe.
And so, yeah.
It's just one of\nthese things that--
the material qualities\nare important,
but also the material\nqualities in the model-making.
So actually a lot of times\nwe'll make the models
with analogous qualities to\nwhat the real material will be.
So if it's going\nto be bent wood,
we'll wet some cardboard\nlaminated layers
and get it to bend\nto make the model.
Do you know what I mean?
So it wouldn't be the same\nif you just printed it out.
So you learn things, try\nto use it to learn things
about materials.
Yeah.
Which is nice to work with the\nCalifornia College of the Arts
right now, because\nthey're totally
about marrying up the analog\nand the digital world.
So that's a new product that\nwe're getting going on now.
So, yeah.
Thank you.
Anybody else?
Yes.
Maybe while you're getting the\nmic, one thing that would be--
not to put you on\nthe spot, but--
Uh-oh.
[chuckles]
No, just-- I think\nbecause there are
a lot of people who\nare new to the school
and who sort of maybe don't\nknow that we have been putting
a lot of emphasis on research\nand also more and more
on the relationship between sort\nof design-related research--
and that's really something\nthat you're doing.
And you're doing\nthat in the office.
But I also know that\nthat's something
that's very evident in the\nstudios that you're doing.
But I know as of\nnext year you'll also
be trying to conduct, in a\nway, certain kinds of research
outside of the studio\nhere, which is probably
both related to what you\nmight be doing in the office,
but also different.
And I think maybe just in the\nspirit of tonight's open house,
it would be good if you could\nshare some thoughts about what
you see as potential domains\nof research that are exciting,
that might be happening next\nyear or in the years to come?
Yeah.
OK.
And then we can finish with you.
No, that's a good question.
And, you know, some of\nthe threads that have been
in the work about materials--
I've been more and\nmore interested
in the materials in\ntheir second life.
And so kind of working on\nthe idea of reducing carbon
in our world through making more\nof the second life of materials
waste.
And it really does touch\nall the categories,
if you think back to\nthe Tour Montparnasse.
Like, what happens\nto all of this glass
coming off of a building?
Like, so it had already\nused its first life.
Where is it going next?
So more and more important\nwith a world that
is accumulating a lot of stuff\nin our terrestrial and marine
environments.
And so if those ideas about\nreuse, recycling, and thinking
about the waste stream\ncould be a launching point
and a resiliency issue as well.
I think those things\nwill come together
in an interesting way that will\nbe a focus of the five years
that I'll be able to\nbe here and work on it.
So what I like\nabout the issue is,
it doesn't limit to the\ntypology or a city, per se.
But it could be\nsomething that goes
across a lot of\ndifferent categories.
Hi.
I'd like to first echo some\nof the previous comments
and also say thank you for\ncoming and giving your lecture.
I thought it was\nvery interesting.
Particularly your\nfinal project where
you're talking about\nre-contextualizing the Memphis
waterfront and touching on\nthe controversy surrounding
Confederate war memorials.
I was wondering-- because I'm\nfrom South Carolina, where
we have lots of not\nonly Confederate war
memorials, but also architecture\nlike plantations, that's
tied to this sort of very\nproblematic political ideology
from the Antebellum period.
So I was wondering, with\nthis type of architecture,
how you think we, as\narchitects, should think
of these sorts of buildings,\nand if we have a responsibility
to try to re-contextualize it,\nor maybe bulldoze it, or take
an entirely different approach?
Hm.
Well, OK.
That's a very good question.
And I think what--
the first is to know\nwhere you're working.
Because there are--\nand you can't know it
without talking to the\npeople there and really
getting the lay of the land\nfrom across a representative
transect of the city, not just\none group that is your client.
You know?
So that, I think, falls\non the responsibility
of the architect.
And one of the\nthings we discovered,
like with the Civil\nWar memorials,
were that a lot of\nthem were placed, like,
in the late '60 and '70s.
So they obviously weren't done\nat the time because of some,
you know--
they were done for\npolitical reasons.
So kind of like understanding\nall of the complexity of it
is the first thing\nto do, and not
being afraid to find\nsome things that you--
you are going to\nfind things that
are very difficult\nthings, that unravel.
But don't be afraid\nto do that, as long
as you are engaged\nwith the community
that you're working in.
That's the main message.
That it can't be done in\nour studios away from that.
And that will help open\nup the path of what to do.
So you have to be able to--
as a designer it's a\nlittle bit difficult
going in without knowing\nwhat you want to make yet.
You know?
But if you let the process\nunfold, it will become clear,
I think.
So, yeah.
Good question.
Jeanne, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you all for coming.
[applause]
