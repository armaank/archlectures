Good evening, everybody.
My name is Diane Davis.
And as chair of the Department\nof Urban Planning and Design,
I'm here to welcome\nyou to the GSD
and to introduce\ntonight's speaker,
Mr. Christopher Hawthorne.
Christopher has worn many hats\nover the past several years,
all of which have led\nhim to his current post
as the chief design officer\nfor the city of Los Angeles.
And I'm going to speak about\nthat post in a few minutes.
But let me just say something\nabout Christopher's background,
some of it was already\nup on the slide.
But it's important to know that\nChristopher started his career
in architectural criticism,\nafter receiving degrees
from Yale in both\npolitical science
and architectural history.
Most recently, he served\nas the architecture critic
for the Los Angeles Times, a\npost he held from 2014 to 2018,
before resigning\nthat position to work
with Mayor Eric Garcetti as\nhis chief design officer.
I should also mention that\nconcurrently, Christopher
is a professor of practice\nat Occidental College
and has taught previously\nin the journalism department
at UC Berkeley, at Columbia,\nand at SCI-Arc, the Southern
California Institute\nof Architecture.
He's written and directed\nprograms for PBS,
including a documentary\non Frank Lloyd Wright,
and a 2016 public KCET--
I think that's a public\nstation in northern California.
Is it northern or southern?
Southern
Southern.
Series title, the Third\nLos Angeles Project,
for which he wrote he received\nan LA area Emmy for his role
as executive producer.
And interspersed with\nall these accomplishments
were stints at the\nAmerican Academy in Rome
and a position as a mid-career\nfellow at Columbia University's
National Arts\nJournalism Program.
So clearly when Mayor Garcetti\ndecided that Los Angeles needed
a chief design\nofficer, he didn't
have to look very far to find\nthe right person for the job.
Of course to me, all that\nraises the question--
all this raises the\nquestion of what exactly
a chief design officer\nis expected to do.
And how working in\nthe public sector
might require a different skill\nset or sensibility than that
articulated through the\nmedia or third estate,
where Christopher has\na lot of experience.
So I think we're going\nto hear a little more
about that later tonight.
But in speaking\nto him earlier, I
want to say that he mentioned\nthat a lot of his work
is directed towards\nfacilitating conversations
between architects, urban\ndesigners on the one hand,
and planners on the other.
And when he said\nthat, I have to admit
that I toyed with the idea\nof asking him to give me
some pointers,\npersonally, as sometimes
I feel that that is one of\nmy jobs here at the GSD,
because we are blessed to\nhave one department with two
different professions in it.
It's not quite the\nsame level of stakes
as the city of Los Angeles.
But really I\nunderstand the world
that you're living\nin now, Christopher.
So before turning the\npodium over to Christopher,
I'd like to place his\nposition and this job
into a little more context.
First and foremost, although\nthe city of Helsinki
was one of the first in the\nworld to name a chief design
officer, which it did so\nin the spring of 2016,
this type of position\nis really very unique.
Even now, two years after\nthe Helsinki decision,
there are very few major cities\nin the world with chief design
officers.
And in the United States,\nLos Angeles is the only one.
So in this sense, Christopher\nHawthorne's position
is unique and\nholds the potential
to change the way future\ncities are designed,
built, and planned.
Second, and this kind\nof follows from the idea
that LA Is the only place\nthat has a chief design
officer in the United\nStates, let's not
forget that LA Is not just\nany old American city.
When Mayor Eric said he\ndecided in March 2018
that the city of Los Angeles\nneeded a chief design officer,
he faced a city\nthat was growing,
and it has been for a\nwhile, by leaps and bounds,
both physically and with respect\nto global investment, much
of it directed towards\nnew architectural and
infrastructural projects.
Much, although not all\nof that development,
was connected to efforts\nto refocus attention
on downtown development\nor downtown areas.
Much of that jump\nstarted and are motivated
by such new projects, well, I\nguess is not so new anymore,
Gehry's Disney Symphony Hall and\na variety of other innovations,
projects, infrastructure\nchanges near the what
one might call the center of\nLos Angeles, which was never
really felt to be a downtown.
For those of you\nwho know LA, you
know that it's a sprawling\nmetropolis with many districts
and activities that remain\nunconnected and fragmented.
It really wasn't like a downtown\nlike in Chicago or New York.
So in fact, one\nof the very first
important historical\nbooks on the city written
in 1967 by Robert Fogelson\nan urban historian at MIT
who I had the pleasure of\nteaching with several years
back, is called Los Angeles,\nThe Fragmented Metropolis.
And the facts of Los\nAngeles' fragmentation
were later addressed in a\nnew forward to that book that
was written almost 30\nyears later by Robert
Fishman, a very major\nplanning historian.
So both of these Roberts\nhighlighted the contested
political decision making and\nweak planning institutions
that contribute to the city's\nsprawl and spatial development.
It is in this\nhistorical context--
oh, let's not forget\nthe Olympics is coming
around the corner as well.
So it is in that historical\nand spatial context
that Mayor Garcetti\nidentified the need
for more purposeful\ncollaboration
among the variety of\nactors and institutions
across the scale of the\nmetropolis, whose actions
combined have ended up\nmaking Los Angeles the city
that it is today,\nfor better or worse.
And I'm talking about here\narchitects, city officials,
urban designers and\nplanners, and including
in their ranks, those with\nengineering, law, and ecology
backgrounds.
So with this mandate,\nChristopher Hawthorne
has thrown himself\nsquarely into the vortex
of competing professionals who\ndo not always see eye to eye.
Yet, I would say it\ncould be precisely
his background in\npolitical science
and architectural\nhistory that gives him
a vision and a\nplatform to draw, I
mean, he can kind of\nrise above and draw
from all these\ndifferent approaches
and find the ways that\nthese different experts
and their commitments\ncan be reformulated
so that the whole is greater\nthan the sum of its parts.
And I really can't\nthink of a better person
to be triangulating,\nencouraging,
and inspiring a\nnew design vision
for the city of Los Angeles.
In some of the articles I read\nthat either Christopher has
written or about him, it's clear\nthat he's already called out
the need to think about\nbeauty in all projects,
whether big or small,\nfor poor or rich.
He's also identified\nthe importance
of thinking about the public\nrealm and the city's potential
to activate a sense of\ncivic duty in its residents
through various design\nand planning projects.
And finally, he's shown\nhimself to be tethering
these and other ambitions\nto larger sustainability
commitments in areas\nof transportation
and the environment.
And I know a little bit\nabout these latter efforts
because I had the pleasure\nof meeting and starting
conversations with\nChristopher about a joint GSD,
City of Los Angeles\ninitiative focused
on the future of streets\nthat will have an option
studio connected\nto it in the spring
and that is being\nshepherded by Andres Sevtsuk
and myself along\nwith other faculty
and students in the Urban\nPlanning and Design department.
And one thing that impressed me\nabout Christopher's enthusiasm
for this rather\nexperimental effort
to rethink how streetscapes\ncould and should
be reconfigured was\nhis understanding
that the world would\nbe looking to LA
for leadership in this and\nother innovative design regards.
After all, one wonders if\nLA can change its reputation
as an overly\nfragmented motorway,
in many ways the car\ncapital of the world.
And I have to say that\njust as an anecdote, when
I moved to Los Angeles from\nChicago many decades ago
to start graduate school\nin urban sociology,
the first thing I complained\nto my friends at home
was that this was not a\ncity, it was a parking lot.
But now, it's\ngoing to be a city.
And I would say that my overly\ndystopian view at that time
was actually very\nquickly demolished
when I learned about the\nvarieties of neighborhoods,
cultures, and spaces that LA\nalready was nurturing decades
back.
But they were kind of\nhidden in the context
of sprawling freeways to\nnowhere and the near absence
of a downtown.
So what I've seen in\nthe last six months
that Christopher has\nbeen in his office--
and it's not really very\nlong considering the ambition
of the task at hand--
is that he's leading\nthe charge to change
the practices of\narchitecture and urban design
to serve both public\nand aesthetic purposes,
to reverse fragmentation, and\nto start to fashion a city out
of whole cloth, to guarantee the\ndignity of the urban experience
for all the city's residents.
So thank you, Christopher\nfor joining us here tonight
and helping us understand the\nchallenges you are facing,
the accomplishments you\nalready have under your belt,
and your plans for the future.
[applause]
Thank you Diane, for\nthat extraordinarily kind
introduction.
You've really set out\nthe challenges for me.
Reversing the fragmentation,\ncreating a real city,
I will do my best.
It's a pleasure to be back.
I was here about three\nyears ago for a conversation
on criticism in my old life\nas a critic at the LA Times
with Michael Sorkin, Michael\nHays, Olly Wainwright,
Florencio Rodriguez.
It was really a\nterrific conversation.
And it's really\ngreat to be back.
It's so nice to have seen some\nfaces from Los Angeles, also
and to be able to spend some\ntime with Mark Lee, a friend,
and see him in action\nhere in Cambridge.
So we will come back\nto this slide in a bit.
I start with it to\nreally emphasize,
to a certain extent,\nthe work that I
have ahead of me in terms of\nrethinking the public realm.
And also to emphasize\nthat all the projects that
are coming out of my\noffice will really
begin with an emphasis on\nclimate change and equity,
I think first and foremost.
And I think both\nof those challenges
are suggested by this\nimage and suggest
the poverty of much of how\nwe've designed the public realm.
But we do have a\nlonger history and I
want to get into that\na little bit too.
Before I move ahead,\na quick question.
How many of you\nwere born or spent
any part of your childhood\nin Southern California?
OK.
Anybody who has never set foot\nin the city of Los Angeles?
OK.
A small handful.
OK, great.
So most of you are somewhere\nin between, which is typically
how all of this works.
So I'll talk a little\nbit about this transition
and how I decided\nto make this leap
and why I decided to make this\nleap at a particular moment
of transition for\nLos Angeles, which
I think is fraught in\nsome ways but also full
of tremendous potential,\nas a sort of hinge moment
as Mayor Garcetti has\ndescribed in this city's
civic and architectural history.
And then talk in the\nsecond half of my remarks
about a handful of projects\nthat I'm working on.
And I'm just about,\nas Diane mentioned,
at the six-month mark\nand that has given me--
it's an interesting\ntime to take stock.
There's certainly\na lot of projects
that are still\nundercooked and not ready
for a public\nintroduction, but I do
have a much better sense\nthan even six weeks
ago about what I'm hoping\nto make a priority.
So let me move on to an\nimage that most of you
probably will have seen\nand be familiar with.
This is Julius Shulman's image\nof Pierre Koenig's Case Study
House, #22, also known as the\nStahl House in the Hollywood
Hills.
Probably, perhaps the most\nfamous architectural image
in American history, certainly\nthe most famous in Los Angeles
history.
But the version of\nthis series of images
by Julius Shulman that I've\nbecome much more interested
in, in recent weeks\nis this one, which
suggests a sort of\ndifferent perspective
maybe about how\nthe sausage is made
and certainly the degree\nto which boosterism
and the kind of manufactured\nand carefully packaged glamor
have always been central\nto LA's global image
and its self-image.
And this is one of\nJulius's assistants
here holding up a tree\nbranch in the foreground.
And I was lucky enough\nto get to know Julius
at the very end of his life,\ntoward the end of his life
when I started at\nthe LA Times in 2004.
And he was not\nshy about agreeing
to that charge of\nbeing a salesman
and sort of packaging LA's myth\nand selling it to the world.
I also loved the way that he's\nhanging off this wall the way
that the house sort of\nhangs off the hillside.
And he was known for going\nto those sorts of lengths
to get just the\nshot that he wanted.
So in general, I'm skeptical of\nthe notion of LA exceptionalism
which is to say the idea\nthat Los Angeles occupies
a category of one in\nAmerican urban studies,
that it stands entirely\napart from other cities
or to Diane's part that it\nmaybe doesn't qualify as a city
at all.
But one thing that\ndid become clear to me
in nearly 15 years\nof studying, writing
about this city as the\ncritic at the LA Times,
was that we do wrap together\nutopia and dystopia, promise
and peril, in a singular\nway in Los Angeles perhaps
best epitomized by\nthe way that our palm
trees, universal symbols of a\ncertain idea of benign climate
and the good life\nin Los Angeles,
tend to be torched\nevery 4th of July
by wayward fireworks,\nsometimes well aimed fireworks,
suggesting that disaster\nis never far away.
And sometimes we even set our\nwaterless Los Angeles river
on fire over the 4th of\nJuly weekend as well.
And keep in mind that in--
sorry, go back-- Yeah.
Keep in mind that\nin Nathanael West,
The Day of the\nLocust, which remains
among the very best novels\nof Los Angeles and Hollywood,
the painting that stands\nnear the center of the story
is called The Burning\nof Los Angeles.
And often we don't\neven let the paint
dry on our most important\ncultural and architectural
landmarks before we set fire\nto them, at least on canvas.
This is Ed Ruscha's, one\nof a series of paintings
he made between 1965 and 1970\ncalled the Los Angeles County
Museum on Fire, not long\nafter William Pereira's
collection of buildings for\nLACMA on Wilshire Boulevard
was finished.
So all of that is to\nsay is that by the time
Mayor Garcetti asked me to take\non a new position at City Hall,
a little bit of what you've\nheard about from Diane,
as chief design officer, not\ndesign czar as the New York
Times had it, I did already\nhave a sense of both
the political\ncontours of the city
and I would say the\nexceptionally wide and perhaps
peculiar range of ways in which\narchitecture and landscape have
helped shape LA's\nsense of itself
and perhaps what it\nowes its citizens.
So the job really came out\nof a series of conversations
that I had with the\nmayor beginning actually
before he was elected.
In 2013, when he was\nrunning for office,
the LA Chapter of the American\nInstitute of Architects
put together a series\nof conversations
with all of the mayoral\ncandidates, not a debate,
but a conversation\nwith each of them.
And the then planning director--
sorry then, president of\nthe Planning Commission,
Bill Roschen and I, conducted\na series of conversations
about architecture, urban\nplanning, urban design
with all of the candidates.
And it became clear, even in\nthose early conversations,
that Eric Garcetti, then the\npresident of the City Council
representing Hollywood\nand Silver Lake,
was exceptionally interested\nin and well-versed in matters
related to those\nsubjects and very
interested in the\nfuture of the built
environment in Los Angeles.
So after he was\nelected, he asked me
if we could continue that\nconversation at greater length.
And so I put together\na conversation
at Occidental College\nin which we actually
stopped the conversation\nmidway through to hear
a couple of songs from the\nmusician you see at left,
Gabriel Kahane,\nfor whom I had just
written my first and\nonly batch of liner notes
to accompany a record of\nhis called The Ambassador,
which has 10 songs,\neach of which
is connected to one\nsignificant architectural
or historical\naddress in the city.
It's a terrific record.
So you can imagine\nmy conversations
with the mayor's\nadvance team, letting
them know that the mayor\nand I would talk for a while
and then we would stop\nand a musician would
come out and play a couple of\nsongs about LA architecture,
and then we would\ngo back to talking.
But that's precisely\nwhat we did.
And actually it worked\nout rather well.
And that's the mayor putting\na photograph of Gabriel
on Instagram from the stage.
So when the mayor was\nre-elected in 2017,
he asked if I would consider\ndoing another conversation
at Occidental which we did,\nthis time in a bigger venue,
and had an opportunity\nto talk about the promise
of his second term.
And it's important to\nmention that mayors in LA
are term-limited to\ntwo four-year terms.
But because we changed\nthe electoral calendar
in Los Angeles-- we\nused to elect our mayors
in the spring of\nodd years and now we
do so in the fall of even\nyears, his second term,
despite the fact that\nhe was term limited,
would stretch an\nextra 18 months or so.
So it would be five and 1/2\nyears instead of four years.
And it was happening at a\nmoment of significant transition
and change, some of which I\nwill get into, in Los Angeles.
And the combination of the\nmayor's interest, enthusiasm
about these subjects\nand the length
of that second term and all\nof the consequential decisions
that we face about the\nfuture shape of this city,
convinced me that it was worth\nmaking the leap from really,
the only job that I ever\naspired to have which,
is to say as an\narchitecture critic,
to this newly created position.
So it comes officially\nthrough the planning office.
It's attached to\nthe Mayor's Office.
And I work with one\nof the deputy mayors.
But my work-- I'm a bit of\nan outlier to the extent
that my work also\noverlaps with work
of some of the\nother deputy mayors
in Garcetti's administration.
There is a model.
There was a model for the\nposition to a certain extent.
The mayor has a chief\nsustainability officer
and a chief data officer.
And so there are these\nso-called chief positions
in the administration.
But mine is a\nlittle bit different
because it crosses\nover from, I think
it touches on more departments\nthan some of those other jobs
and is a bit of an\nexperiment in that sense.
And so, as I mentioned,\nby the time that we
had had this conversation and\nthe one the followed in 2017,
it had become clear that\nsomething fundamental
is shifting in Los Angeles.
So this is a pairing of\nimages that I've often
used in lectures to\nsuggest that transition.
So again, the Shulman\nphoto of the Case
Study #22, the\nStahl house at left,
with models wearing\nwhite dresses.
And then at right, image from\na really remarkable series
of immigration rights\nmarches that took
place not long after I\narrived in Los Angeles.
This is in the spring of 2006.
There was immigration reform\nlegislation pending in Congress
and, organized largely by\nSpanish language radio,
hundreds of thousands, somewhere\nbetween 400,000 and 500,000
people likely took\nto the streets.
This is an image along Broadway.
And also on Wilshire\nBoulevard, really what
had been the capital of\ncar culture in Los Angeles.
So announcing what\nhad by that point
was a really significant\ndemographic shift,
this was right at the moment\nthat Latinos were becoming
the majority in LA county\nand they have since
reached that milestone\nin the city of LA
as well after many decades of\nimmigration from Latin America
and also from Asia that really\npeaked in the early 1990s.
I think really accelerating\nafter immigration law was
changed in 1965 and really\npeaking in the early 1990s.
And that really changed the city\nin some basic fundamental ways.
And these marches announced\na kind of political interest,
but also I think announced\nthat this new emerging
city was interested in using\nthe spaces of Los Angeles
in new and different ways.
And so over the subsequent\nyears that I was at the Times
there were other examples\nof that transition beginning
in 2010.
It's easy to remember\nwhen this started
because the first CicLAvia\nwas on 10-10-10, October 10,
2010, an event that's modeled\nafter Ciclovia in Bogota,
Colombia, which closes several\nmiles of streets to car traffic
and opens it up to\ncyclists and pedestrians.
This is an image from the\nmost recent one, which
is just a couple\nof weeks ago, which
was a partnership with the\nLos Angeles Philharmonic
to mark the centennial\nof the LA film, which
included a lot of musical\nprogramming along the route.
It was a route that went\nfrom Grand Avenue, where
I took this picture, in a part\nof the city Bunker Hill, which
will get back to in a little bit\nthat has not, to put it mildly,
been known for\nactive street life,
to see these buildings-- that's\nThe Broad in the foreground
and Walt Disney Concert Hall.
At the center of\nthe image, to see
this part of the street\nanimated, activated in this way
was really remarkable.
And there have been several of\nthese CicLAvia over the years
which closely match the\nso-called open streets projects
that are happening in other\ncities around the country.
And there was also a\nmoment when we began,
in really dramatic fashion,\nthese parades, for lack
of a better word, that brought\nsignificant cultural and
technological objects\nback from the edges.
I actually wrote a\npiece about this.
This was when we brought the\nEndeavor space shuttle, which
had just been retired.
And we paraded it through\nthe streets of Los Angeles
to Exposition Park,\nwhere it is now
on display at the California\nScience Center, just south
of USC next to where the\nLucas, new Lucas Museum by MAD
Architects will be located,\nfor those of you who
know that part of Los Angeles.
I wrote a piece in the\nLA Times comparing this
to a Roman triumph,\nwhich is to say,
these are objects\nthat Los Angeles
was famous for making and\nsending out into outer space.
And we had begun to\ncollect these objects
from the edges of empire,\nas it were, and parade them
through the city.
This was really\na remarkable day.
I took one of my\ndaughters out to see
the space shuttle come through\nthe streets of Los Angeles.
And it also attracted\na gigantic crowd
and produced this,\nwhich is also one
of my favorite images of Los\nAngeles by one of my colleagues
at the LA Times.
Similarly, when LACMA was\ninstalling Michael Heizer's
project, Levitated Mass, and\ncolloquially known as The Rock,
it too paraded it\nthrough this city
in this sort of special\noccasion that triumph
like in terms of bringing\nthis object again
out from the periphery into\nthe center, geographical center
of Los Angeles where\nit could be displayed.
In this setting, just\nnorth of Renzo Piano's
Resnick Pavilion, the\nsecond of two Renzo Piano
projects at LACMA.
And I always recalled\nfor me this image,
which I saw first I think\nat the Architectural
Biennale in Venice, at ARENA's\nBiennale two years ago,
which is a Filip\nDujardin image, which
suggests sort of the\nchallenge of infill,
the peculiar challenge of infill\ndevelopment in Los Angeles.
Which is to say, it's\nbeen a city so connected
to notions of the\nuncanny and sort
of rule-breaking\narchitecture, that when
we talked about infill, I think\nit's useful to keep images
like this in mind in terms\nof what we're squeezing back
into the middle of the city,\nto go back to The Rock, Michael
Heizer's project.
And that transition\nin terms of infill
was really a way\nfrom something too.
It was a way from this\nnotion of the single family
house with garden and often\na swimming pool, which
had been popularized not only\nby the Case Study projects,
of course, but\nalso the paintings
of David Hockney and others.
And was a kind of combination\nof architecture and lifestyle
that had been wrapped together\nmore seamlessly than perhaps
in any other American city.
And it's important\nto say, was enabled
by an entire infrastructure\nof, let's say, privatization
across the entire region.
So this kind of an image, to\nsay nothing of the Case Study
program, was really\nonly made possible
because we were investing\nso dramatically in freeway
construction after\nthe war, was a moment,
of course, when the federal\ngovernment was practically
insisting that\ncities take funding
to build those freeways.
But in Los Angeles, it\nproduced a really singular kind
of combination of architecture\nclimate and landscape
really best epitomized by\nthese Hockney paintings.
And so infill, as it\nhappens in Los Angeles,
doesn't always look the same\nas it does in other cities.
This is an important\nproject by Michael Maltzan
called One Santa Fe.
Many of you probably\nwill have seen.
It's directly across\nthe street from SCI-Arc
from the position\nof this photograph.
And then on the backside is\nalong the Los Angeles river
in the Arts District\nneighborhood, the Arts District
section of downtown.
And it is, I think,\nreally significant in what
Michael, as I wrote\nabout it, was trying
to do, which is to take sort\nof typical new apartment
block, which is\noften wood frame,
over a parking\npodium which produces
a lot of architectural\nbanality across the city
and stretch it horizontally in\nthe direction of monumentality,
which is to say pull it\nlike taffy until it becomes
a monumental presence.
And of course, Los Angeles\nhas a great tradition
of these horizontal skyscrapers\nsort of tipped on their sides.
Think of not just the\nbuildings up on Bunker Hill,
but the Blue Whale\nby Cesar Pelli
in West Hollywood, these sort of\nmonumental horizontal projects.
So that was also part\nof what was happening
at this moment, this return\nto the, if not the center,
to Diane's point about\na lack of a center
perhaps in Los Angeles, at least\na city that was turning back
on itself and where the\nimportant activity and change
was happening in a city that\nwas turning inward again.
So Mike Davis in\nCity of Quartz which
was published in\n1990, famously said
that Los Angeles\nwas the city that
ate the desert, that\ndreamt of being infinite,
which is to say,\nwas always fixated
on the periphery in terms\nof that sort of expansion.
But what we've seen\nin recent years
is a city really turning\nback toward its midsection
and thinking about how\nto build more densely
in those parts of the city.
Perhaps most\nsignificantly of all
is the transit expansion that\nis now underway in Los Angeles.
This image on the left\nis the Metro Rail network
as it existed in 2000.
And this is essentially\nas it existed
when I got to Los Angeles.
We had added a gold\nline to Pasadena
by the time I got to LA in 2004.
But it was really\njust a kind of sketch,
a hint of what a mature\ntransit system might look like.
And by 2028, we will\nhave many of the projects
that you see and others\nwill be under way,
paid for by the most\nrecent sales tax measure
that we've passed countywide,\nwhich is Measure M, which
was passed in 2016.
It followed on the heels of\nMeasure R, which was in 2008.
Both of those, because\nthey're tax measures
in the state of California,\nrequire a super majority,
which is to say a 2/3 vote,\nwhich is a very high bar
to clear.
Measure M wound up getting\nalmost 71% of the vote.
So very, very clear suggestion\nof a kind of mandate
for transportation investment.
But as you can see, we\nhave a long way to go.
And I will point out this\nline here, which will be,
is a proposed sort\nof putative train
through the Sepulveda Pass\nunder the 405 Freeway, which
will really be, I think\nthe project connecting
the west side of Los Angeles and\nSanta Monica with the Valley,
San Fernando Valley.
And I think when that\nproject is finished,
although it will\nprobably require
many years and a public-private\npartnership to get finished,
will suggest that this network\nis finally, finally complete.
So we have accelerated in\nlooking ahead to the Olympics
in 2028, 10 years from\nnow, a number of projects
that we have a--
Metro has a 28 by 28\ninitiative underway
to accelerate or finish\n28 major projects
by the time the Olympics arrive.
So you get a sense\nof what's happening
and Measure M will raise,\nin the next 40 years,
something like something like\n$120 billion, not all of which
will go to public transit,\nthe lion's share of it will.
There are also a lot of\nroadway improvements,
the kinds of things\nthat you have
to include in that\nkind of a package
to get the super majority\nthat I talked about.
But, if you add that\nnumber and the investments
that we're making in new\nparks, housing, open space,
investment connected\nto the Olympics
is somewhere in the\nmagnitude of $200 billion.
The mayor has described\nMeasure M itself as our transit
expansion itself, as the\nbiggest public works project
in American history times two.
And you get a\nsense from this map
of the scale of\nwhat is underway.
It's also important to say,\ngiven the longer history that I
mentioned, that we\nhave in our civic DNA,
a significant transit system\nthat existed before we
put that freeway network in.
And so this is a map of\nthe streetcar network
that existed and really\npeaked in the 1920s
and could take you from\nRiverside all the way to Venice
and from the San Fernando Valley\nand Mount Lowe all the way down
to Long Beach and had a\nnumber of neighborhood stops.
It was a private network.
It's important to say it was\npaid for by Pacific Electric,
by train tycoons like\nHenry Huntington.
And it was often done-- it\nwas often intimately connected
with real estate\nspeculation, which is to say,
many of these\nstreetcar car lines
were extended into empty space\nwhere a new subdivision was
about to be built in\nhopes of attracting
buyers and connecting\nthat subdivision
to the rest of the city.
So Diane mentioned very\nbriefly a project of mine
called Third Los\nAngeles, which is
to suggest that this new\nLA that we're moving into
is best understood as\nactually the third major phase
of civic development\nin Los Angeles.
And that this era\nof Los Angeles,
before the war, when we had\nthis remarkable transit network,
is the first LA.
And second LA is that post-war\nLos Angeles, that postwar city
that created all of those\ntropes and stereotypes that
are familiar around the world\nabout swimming pools and movie
stars.
So, but it's important\nto say, and I
think important as we\nplan this new transit
future that, as I mentioned,\nthe civic DNA of the city
is a Los Angeles\nbefore the freeway,
before the dominance of the\ncar, and to a certain extent,
before the single\nfamily house as well.
This is one of those\nstreet cars which
began to be torn out\nbefore World War II.
Los Angeles, like most\ncities, bet very heavily
that the car was the future.
The kind of conspiracy theory\nabout the car companies
and the tire companies\nbeing responsible
is not quite accurate.
I think it's fair to\nsay that Los Angeles saw
the car on the freeway\nas the future like so
many other places did and\nbegan tearing out these tracks.
But in terms of the\nexpansion that I mentioned,
it's important to say that\nthe Expo line and other train
lines, Expo connects\ndowntown Los
Angeles to the beach\nin Santa Monica,
a lot of these new\ntrain lines actually
follow the old rights of way\nthat the street cars followed.
And so there is what\nReyner Banham called
the "transportation\npalimpset" of the city, which
is to say the\nfreeways were written
on the lines of the\nold streetcars, which
were themselves\nsometimes written
on the lines of the old\nboundaries of the ranchos,
which were subdivided, the\nGreat Basin of Los Angeles.
That palimpsest is\ngetting another series
of lines on it, traced by new\ntransit lines like the Expo
Line across the city.
And so in some ways from\na political point of view,
this expansion has been\nmade easier by the fact
that we do have in\nour DNA that earlier
city before what\nReyner Banham called
autopia sort of descended on.
Los Angeles
And so that earlier city,\nthis first Los Angeles,
also had a really\nvital street life.
And the number of\nphotographs that you
can find suggesting\nwhat we would now
think of as a multimodal\nstreet experience
is practically endless.
These are all pictures from\nLos Angeles Public Library
collection.
This is the corner of 8th and\nBroadway, probably late '20s.
This image is probably\nin 1928 or 1929.
This is the Tower\nTheater, which is now
being converted by Foster and\nPartners into an Apple store
as the changes in\ndowntown accelerate.
But there are a number of images\nlike this from downtown that
suggest just how vital\nthe street life was
and how significant the\npedestrian culture was in,
predominantly downtown,\nbut really many
parts of Los Angeles.
This is one of my favorite\nimages from that period,
suggesting again this\nsort of negotiation
among street cars,\nprivate cars, pedestrians.
You'll often see a lot of\ncyclists in these images.
We also built the beginnings\nof a bicycle superhighway
from Pasadena that was meant to\nbe an elevated bikeway leading
all the way to downtown.
Sadly, it was never completed.
But there was a really active\nbike culture in this moment
as well.
And I mentioned that there is\na city before the single family
house.
There were, in this\nfirst Los Angeles,
remarkable experiments in\nmultifamily architecture.
This is Irving Gill's\nHoratio West Court from 1919.
A six-unit project in the\nOcean Park neighborhood
of Santa Monica, very\nclose to the beach.
And it suggests that\nthere is a model even now
as we think about\ndensification and moving
past the single\nfamily house, there
is a model in our own history.
This is a remarkably\nprogressive project
in all sorts of ways\narchitecturally,
but also in terms\nof site planning.
It's six units.
Four larger units in the\nfront, two smaller units
in the back here,\nsorry, and then it's
arranged around a central drive\nwith parking bays for smaller
cars than we have\nnow in the back.
Really remarkable project\nand suggests again
that there was a Los Angeles\nbefore the single family house
of those Hockney paintings.
And lots of other prominent\nmodernist architects
and other architects\nwere working
in the same vein in this first\nLos Angeles, Richard Neutra
and Schindler and the anonymous\narchitects of bungalow courts
and other kinds of projects\nthat suggested an earlier,
multi-family history.
So in the time that I have\nleft, I want to talk about a few
of the projects\nthat I'm working on
given that sort of reading\nof Los Angeles, which I think
has really informed the way that\nI've approached the new job.
And while I've talked about\nmaybe a half dozen places where
I'm focusing some of my\nefforts, some of these
are projects that I'm\ninitiating, like this one
from my office.
Others are projects\nwhere I'm collaborating
with a range of folks\nin the mayor's office
and in departments\nacross the city.
So the kind of direct influence\nI have on a project really
varies from case to case.
This is one that is coming as\nan initiative from my office
and in collaboration with the\nchief sustainability officer
and a group in LA called the\nLA Cleantech Incubator, which
is the first design competition\nthat I'll be working on,
which is to imagine the\ngas station of the future.
Or perhaps it's better to\nsay imagining Los Angeles
after the gas station as\nefforts at electrification
continue and accelerate.
And the gas station\nimportantly was often
a very significant locus\nfor experimentation
and a way to suggest the\nforward looking optimism
of Los Angeles going back\nall the way to the '20s.
This is a project\nfrom 1965 by Gin Wong,
a Chinese-American\narchitect who worked
in William's Pereira's office.
A gas station for\nUnion 76 that was
planned for LAX and actually\nwas built ultimately
in Beverly Hills.
And so with the CSO's office\nand with LA Cleantech Incubator,
I'm working on a design\ncompetition which
will imagine first, what the\ncharging station of the future
looks like, the extent to which\nit has a public space, retail,
sort of communal component,\nthe extent to which
it will be a place where many\ndifferent kinds of vehicles
are charged.
And thinking about that\nalso is what will ultimately
be an ephemeral building\ntype, because ultimately when
full autonomy arrives, we won't\nneed a charging station that
is communal in that sense.
Your car will drive itself,\nwithout any input from you
in the middle of the\nnight to charge itself
somewhere remotely.
But in the interim,\nin the limbo,
as we sort of negotiate\nthis transition between cars
with drivers and\nautonomous vehicles,
we have to think about what\nthat charging station looks like
and the ways that it will\nserve the public and the kind
of urban design implications.
And the second part\nis imagining what
the sites of gas\nstations like this one
ultimately will become.
Many sites of gas\nstations in Los Angeles
occupy really important\ncorner locations.
Many of them are in\neconomically, environmentally
challenged neighborhoods.
There are intersections in Los\nAngeles where three of the four
corners are occupied\nby gas stations
and the fourth by a\nfast food restaurant
with a drive-through.
We're thinking about\nasking designers
to help us imagine, in\ncollaboration and conversation
with the owners of those\nsites, what happens
from an urban planning point\nof view and urban design
point of view at those really\nimportant, crucial corner sites
as gas goes away--
of course environmental\nremediation
will be necessary-- but\ngiven the importance, given
how much this realm is shifting\nand the technology is changing
and given the importance\nof the gas station
as a sort of building\ntype in Los Angeles.
That will be one initiative\nthat I'm working on fairly soon.
We're calling it\nfrom Pumps to Plug.
And it's part of a\nlarger set of initiatives
that I'm interested in, which\nis to think about the larger
urban design implications of\nvarious forms of new mobility
including of course,\nthe scooters, which
I understand were briefly\nin Cambridge, right?
Before being banished.
It's a similar story\nplaying out in cities
across the country\nwith regulations
hastily being put in place.
But as we think about\nscooters, e-bikes, the approach
of autonomy.
It's, I think,\nreally crucial for us
to try to get ahead\nof that conversation
a little more than\ncities did, let's
say, with the arrival\nof Uber and Lyft
and carshare and try\nto think about what
the design of streets will\nlook like in this new world
of mobility.
In the LA context, it\nhas been politically
challenging in some parts of\nthe city to build bike lanes.
And there's an interesting\nset of questions
now, I think to be considered,\nabout the extent to which
scooter riders are complementary\nor allies of bike advocates
or whether they're at\nodds about the shape
of the design of the street.
And I think all of those\nquestions are playing out.
So another interest\nof mine is shade.
As I mentioned, I showed\nthis image at the top.
Shade as an equity\nissue more than anything
in an era of climate\nchange, which
is to say that our transit\nusers tend, many of them,
not to be able to afford cars.
And so as we get more intense\nheat across the region,
they will not be able\nto duck into an Uber
or go into their\nprivate car as we
have more intense days of heat.
And as we reinvest in and\nre-animate the public sphere
and rethink our transit\nnetwork, we're also,
I think, leaving our\nmost vulnerable citizens
vulnerable to this sort\nof climate change in a way
that we're only beginning\nto grapple with.
Here's another image of\nthe same sort of landscape
that greets transit users.
You often see this kind of\ncondition, people waiting
for the bus in the\nvery narrow shade that
is cast by a bus stop pole.
And this is just to give\nyou an indication of the way
that that intensity will change.
So if you look at\nPasadena, for example,
the shift from 24 days of this--
this is days of 95\ndegrees or more,
by the end of this\ncentury, so you'll
see those days quadrupling\nin a city like Pasadena.
If you have 100 days of\nthat sort of intense heat,
that means many of\nthose days are happening
not in the summertime.
And that means that the kind\nof traditional mechanisms
or strategies we've used\nto provide shade, which
is to say anticipating\nthe hottest time of day
is when the sun is at\nits apex in the summer,
don't really apply.
So there are a lot of people,\nas you saw in these images,
waiting for buses late\nin the day in October
when it's still 95\ndegrees at 5:30.
And so we need a whole\nrange of new strategies,
I think, to consider\nthese issues, which
include the tree\ncanopy, of course,
but also include a kind of\nmore architectural strategies
or raising the\nquestion of what we
ask of developers\nin terms of how
they treat the right of way.
So I will say that this\nis a question in terms
of particular\nstrategy that raises
some interesting questions\nfor somebody in my position.
Which is to say,\nI'm really looking
at if we agree that that\nshade is this kind of equity
issue in an era\nof climate change,
what is the best way\nto achieve that goal?
How do you precisely\nfold that sort of a goal
into a policy framework?
So the other element\nof this moment
in Los Angeles that\nis compelling for me
is that we're also\nnot only getting ready
to make decisions\nabout how to spend all
of this investment for\ntransit and elsewhere,
but we're also\nredoing, rethinking
many of our basic policy\nand planning frameworks
across the city.
So we're remaking\nour zoning code
for the first comprehensive,\nin the first comprehensive way
since the 1940s.
We're writing new\ncommunity plans
across the city for 35\ndifferent sections of the city.
And so the question of where\nto fold an emphasis on shade,
for example, into those\nnew policy frameworks
is something that I've been\nspending a good amount of time
thinking about.
And in fact, the sidewalk is a\nreally interesting territory,
because there are\nall kinds of rules.
Here's another gas station\nat a corner, right?
There are all kinds\nof rules that lead up
to the sidewalk in the terms\nof the building envelope,
or in this case,\nthe gas station.
There are all kinds of\nrules that govern what
happens in the street, right?
But the sidewalk\ncontinues to be a bit
of a free for all from\na policy point of view.
A lot of it falls\nthrough the cracks.
But this is an area of\nreally intense focus
in terms of new\ntechnology, mobility,
the importance of the curb in\nan era of carshare, for example.
And so what happens\nin the sidewalk
becomes more and more important.
And it also reversing a kind\nof architectural strategy
that had been really dominant\nin Los Angeles for a long time.
During the heyday of\nautopia as Banham called it,
we pioneered a kind of\narchitectural strategy
where the facade, the rear\nfacade of a building facing
the parking lot, was\noften as grand or grander
than the one facing the street.
But for a whole bunch\nof reasons connected
to transit, carshare,\nnew forms of mobility,
a lot of the entry to buildings\nnow happens back again
through the front door.
And so the whole choreography\nof arrival from the curb
or the bus stop\nacross the sidewalk,
through the front\nsteps of the building,
is regaining a\nsignificant importance.
So that sort of\nchoreography as it connects
to issues like shade is of\nsignificant interest to me,
as is the fate of\na lot of buildings
produced by this group.
I'm wondering if there's\nanybody who can name everybody.
I wonder if Mark Lee can name\neverybody in this photograph.
Fred Fisher, Robert\nMangurian, don't
know the dog's name, Eric Owen\nMoss with a fabulous Uncle Sam
tie.
Coy Howard, Craig Hodgetts,\nI think in some ways probably
maybe the most interesting\nand under appreciated
of this group.
Thom Mayne of course, and\nmustachioed era Frank Gehry.
This is taken on the\nbeach in Venice in 1980.
So in Los Angeles, we have a\nremarkably comprehensive guide
to cultural and historic\narchitectural resources
called Survey LA which was\ncompiled by a colleague of mine
in the planning department\nnamed Ken Bernstein who
runs the Office of\nHistoric Resources,
as well as helping to\nlead the urban design
studio and the\nplanning department,
which I'm collaborating\nwith quite a bit.
And that is a database of\narchitectural and cultural
resources that is now\navailable to the public, funded
in part by the Getty.
But it stops in the year 1980.
And because of the\nreally rich collection
of buildings that we have\nbetween 1980 and 2000,
I'm really interested\nin figuring out
a way to extend that catalog\nand with it some conversation
about protections for the really\nimportant LA school work that
was produced in Southern\nCalifornia in the '80s and '90s
and extend that survey to 2000.
And it's important in part\nbecause that work, much of it
was really difficult\nto begin with.
It was work that challenged\nconventional notions of beauty
or bourgeois taste.
At the left is the\nKentucky Fried Chicken
on Western Avenue by Elyse\nGrinstein and Jeffrey Daniels.
On the right, residential\naddition by Morphesis,
Thom Mayne and Michael\nRotondi from 1982,
which the New York\nTimes in that year
called "charming,\nbut disquieting".
This project.
And I think it's\nperhaps only in LA
that that adjective,\ndisquieting, would be
used to describe architecture.
It seems straight\nout of noir fiction,
straight out of Joan Didion's\ndescription of the Santa Ana's.
Charles Gwathmey was\nalso quoted in that piece
complaining, sniffing\na little bit.
He said, "What bothers me\nis that some of these houses
are all about graphics,"\nwhich is perhaps true.
So I'm interested\nin figuring out
how we can build\nin some protections
and begin to have a conversation\nthat promotes a broader
understanding of what\nthis work was about,
what it meant at the moment\nbefore it begins to come up,
it begins to face inevitable\nbattles about its fate,
and before some of the\nbuildings faced demolition.
And there are a range of ways\nthat I'm hoping to do that.
And that too is part\nof a larger effort
to think about\nhow we can be more
strategic in our new projects\nin grappling with memory
and history in a city that as\nNorman Klien's book, History
of Forgetting suggested, has\noften, I think quite credibly,
been accused of being\nan amnesiac city,
not tending particularly well\nto its cultural heritage.
The same sentiment might be\nseen in another Ruscha canvas.
He did a series\nof these paintings
in the early '80s suggesting\nthat same tendency
in Los Angeles.
So one of the great\nprivileges of my job
is I have the ability to convene\nreally fascinating groups
of people.
And I'm interested in doing\nessentially a kind of committee
on memory and history,\nbringing together
historians and\narchitects and artists,
to think about how, when we\nare confronted in new projects
with sites that are deeply\nfraught for whatever reason,
that we can avoid the\ntendency that we have tended,
I think too often to fall\ninto in Los Angeles, which
is to pursue a kind of tabula\nrasa, clean slate solution
and start from scratch\nand not grapple
with the complexities of\nthe history of those sites
and the layers of those sites.
And so, I want that\nconversation to begin
in a really abstract way.
But I also want to pick, at the\nbeginning, two or three sites
that we can really direct that\nconversation towards in terms
of policy.
So think about a\ncouple of sites where
we're building a\nmemorial or a monument
or remaking a park that\nhas a complicated history,
and think about using these\nconversations to inform what
we do.
It's already become\nclear to me in six months
that we need a better, sort\nof more nuanced framework
for thinking about\nthat notion of memory
in a city that has a\ndeeper history than some
of its critics have\ngiven it credit for.
Another interest is the\nfate of the tall building
in Los Angeles.
This is me standing on a helipad\nin one of those KCET programs
that Diane mentioned,\nperhaps yawning
at a really boring\nquality of our skyline.
Because of a fire\ndepartment requirement,
every tall building in Los\nAngeles beginning in the 19--
mid-1970s, was required to have\na helipad because the LAPD,
alone among urban\nfire departments,
insisted on being able\nto reserve the right
to fight fires not only\nfrom below but also
from above and rescue office\nusers of these buildings
from the roof.
And as far as I know,\nit never actually,
they never actually executed\nany rescues like that.
But because of that\nrequirement, we
have this remarkably\nflat skyline.
And it's only to go\nback to this image,
I was standing there talking\nabout the building behind me,
which is the new Wilshire\nGrand Hotel, which
was able to get a waiver.
We've since done away with\nthat helipad requirement.
And it does have a\nmore interesting top.
And here's the image from above.
And I mentioned that kind\nof forms of new mobility.
This is probably the\nmoment to mention
that there are a lot\nof start-ups, including
Uber Elevate which\nis an arm of Uber
and other so-called urban\nair mobility start-ups which
are quite interested in\nLos Angeles as a testing
ground for what essentially\nwill be flying taxis, that
is to say drones that are large\nenough to carry passengers.
And the technology\nis probably ready,
will be ready within a decade,\nif you believe the leaders
of some of these start-ups.
Of course, there's a whole host\nof regulatory issues involved
in actually having these\nservices begin to roll out.
But one of the reasons that\na lot of those start-ups
are looking at\ndowntown Los Angeles
is precisely because of\nthis collection of helipads.
So if you're coming\nfrom LAX and you
want to get in one\nof these new vehicles
and come to downtown\nLos Angeles,
these companies are\nalready beginning
to imagine that you might land\nat the top of the Bonaventure
Hotel, for example.
And that there's a collection\nof places for those vehicles
to land already in\nplace in Los Angeles.
So we'll see how that plays out.
The FAA, of course,\nhas traditionally
been in charge of what\nhappens in the air,
but as these drones\nare flying lower
and as passenger drones\nbecome a real policy
reality over the\nnext decade or so,
it will be fascinating to\nsee how those issues play
out both in terms of\nregulation, but also in terms
of urban design.
It turns out though\nthat there is
a really long and\nfascinating history
in Los Angeles for\nthe relationship
between the helicopter\nand let's say,
architectural experimentation.
This is another one of\nthe Case Study projects.
This is Case Study #4,\none of the early projects
from 1945 by Ralph Rapson.
And Esther McCoy\nwho really invented
architecture criticism in Los\nAngeles wrote of this house,
"Rapson\'s rendering\nshowed a helicopter
hovering over the flat\nroof, as if the owner
was coming home to the suburbs\nfrom his day at the office.
His wife is waving to him.
Where is she?
Hanging out diapers\nin the drying yard."
And then she wrote,\nas if to suggest,
what this image\nanticipated, Rapson's money
was on the wrong machine.
Which is to say, he\nimagined that the helicopter
might be something\nthat became commonplace
for personal transportation,\nbut didn't at the same time
anticipate the washer and dryer.
So there is this fascinating\nsort of connection
between the helicopter.
And in fact, a long\nhistory of debates
about tall buildings in\nLos Angeles and what place
they hold.
And so I show this image\nto talk about maybe
what the future of that\nconversation will look like.
There has long been a part\nof the conversation in LA
politically about--
there's been a really\nlively debate going back
more than 100 years about the\nrole that skyscrapers ought
to play and whether Los Angeles\nought to be a city that had,
that was known for\ntall buildings.
A lot of people who\nmoved to Los Angeles
from places like\nNew York and Chicago
tended to argue that they had\nleft those cities for a reason.
And they found the\nhorizontal nature
of Los Angeles appealing.
And therefore, it\nwasn't a city that
should invest in skyscrapers.
And there were several\nballot measures, votes,
about the height limit.
And the voters decided\nthe height limit
on many occasions going\nback as early as 1905.
And now we have a de\nfacto limit written,
I've learned since taking\nthis new position, in the City
Charter itself.
So we had a 150 foot\nheight limit in Los Angeles
until 1956.
When that height limit\nwas repealed, as a way
to assuage concerns about kind\nof rampant Manhattanization,
a de facto height limit in the\nform of a 13 to one FAR cap
was put into the City Charter.
So when I went to a meeting\nearly on for this project,
which was done by the New\nYork firm Handel Architects,
for a site at 5th and\nHill and the sort of edge
of Bunker Hill, I did a\nvery quick calculation.
And sure enough, the FAR on\nthis project is 12.99 something.
So if we were to change\nthat, if we wanted
to have pockets of the city,\nfor example, where we could have
a kind of super tall buildings\nthat are being built in cities
around the world,\nin certain pockets,
we would actually have\nto go back to the voters
and pursue that kind of a\nchange officially as charter
reform, which I\nactually think would
be a fascinating\nconversation to have.
And I think it would be\npart of this longer history,
as I said, of Los Angeles\ndebating in really public ways,
whether we were a city that\nshould be vertical or not.
It would be a continuation\nof interesting history.
So the last couple of\nprojects I'll mention
have to do with the LA river.
This is the image\nof what we might
think of as the\nfirst LA river which
was central to LA's identity.
It was the source of\nLA's drinking water
until 1913, until we built\nthe aqueduct coming down
from the Owens Valley.
A story that in\nslightly modified form
is familiar to most\nof you from Chinatown.
And the city is where\nit is downtown is where
it is because the city,\nthe original pueblo
was founded on the\nbanks of the LA river.
But it was also prone to\nreally deadly flooding.
And by the 1930s,\nit had produced
a number of deadly\nfloods, which led
to the channelization\nof the river led
by the Army Corps of Engineers.
And essentially all\n51 miles of the river
as it runs from San Fernando\nValley to Long Beach
were wrapped in concrete\nas a flood control measure.
And a byproduct of that effort,\nthis incredibly muscular
infrastructural\neffort was essentially
to make the river invisible\nas a public amenity.
So what had been despite\nthis tendency to flood,
a sort of crucial part of a lot\nof communities near the river
had, by the postwar period,\nbeen fenced off and turned
into private space,\nwhich became famous
for car chases and other films.
This is John Boorman's film\nPoint Blank with Lee Marvin.
And that became the\nsetting for, as you
saw in the previous\nimage, graffiti or car
chases or finales of movies.
Or this is a so-called party\ncrew from Boyle Heights.
This on the east side of the\nriver from the early 1990s.
And it been cut off\nas a public space.
And that's beginning to change.
There are a number of efforts to\nrethink the role that the river
might play in Los Angeles.
That's the project that\nI've been working on.
So the city bought last\nyear, a 42 acre parcel,
part of the old Taylor yards.
This is a so-called G2 parcel.
And we are in the process--
it will require significant\nremediation itself
because it was an old rail yard.
But we are in the early\nstages of imagining
how this site might be\nopened up to public access.
As I mentioned, the river\nis 51 miles long in total.
And this is almost exactly\nat the halfway point.
This is across the river\nfrom Frogtown, essentially.
This is San Fernando road.
Those of you who know LA,\nsort of in the base of Mount
Washington, more or less.
But let me go back and point\nout another part of this image,
which is the 5 freeway here.
And the way that the river,\nin the so-called second Los
Angeles, both the\nriver and the freeway
operated in very similar ways.
Which is to say they\nwere mono-cultures.
They were designed to do one\nthing and one thing only.
In the case of the freeway to\ncarry car and truck traffic.
In the case of the river, to\ncarry storm water out to sea.
That's the only\nprogram essentially
that the river had in\nits channelized form.
It was cut off, as I\nsaid, as a public amenity.
And it was designed entirely\nas a flood control channel
from the point of view\nof the Army Corps.
And so what we are\nengaged in at the moment
is an effort to rethink\nboth of these mono-cultures
for this emerging third\nLos Angeles, which
is part of a real focus of\nmy work at the LA Times.
I engaged Michael\nMaltzan's firm.
He worked on this\nproject with Arup
to re-imagine a section\nof the 134 freeways
as it crosses the\nArroyo Seco, which
is to really break through\nthat monoculture notion
and think about a freeway\nthat could actually
enable many things or\ndo many things at once.
In this case, to produce\nelectricity, to collect
stormwater.
And actually in this case, this\nis in the city of Pasadena,
to feed that\nelectricity, the revenue
produced by it, back into\nthe local school districts.
Because Pasadena is a city\nthat controls its own school
district and its own\nDepartment of Water and Power.
So Michael, in a very thoughtful\nway with Arup considered,
the extent to which\nthe freeway could
be a machine for\nproducing revenue
that instead of cutting off\nneighborhoods from one another,
could be redirected into\nthose neighborhoods.
And also executes\nsome sound mitigation,
because sound carries\nall through the Arroyo
from this stretch\nof the freeway.
And similarly,\nChris Reed is here,
did a project with\nus for re-imagining
the 2, the end of\nthe 2 freeway, which
I argued ought to be closed to\ntraffic as it runs from the 5
into Echo Park and Silver Lake.
Again, thinking about a\nversion of our freeway
that could be\nreimagined to enable
all kinds of\nproductive outcomes,
rather than just pollution\nand sort of cutting one part
of the city off from another.
Which again recalls-- this is\na famous mural by the LA Fine
Arts Squad from\n1972, which suggests
the connection between,\neven by the 1970s
and the beginning of the\nenvironmental movement,
between the freeway and this\nidea of environmental ruin.
This is what the\nG2 looks like now.
So we're really\nthinking about how,
while we pursue environmental\nremediation in a certain part
of it, just been interviewing\na list of architects
who might help us with\nso-called early activation which
is to say, to get the public\non a certain part of the parcel
and to the river's edge\non a quicker timetable
even as we do the longer, more\ncomplicated work of remediation
over many years.
So last couple of things.
One of the main\nchallenge in Los Angeles
is housing, housing\naffordability, the homelessness
crisis that we face.
And the City Council, in\ncollaboration with the Mayor's
office, has agreed to build 15,\nat least 15 emergency shelters.
One in each of the\ncity council districts.
But as you can imagine these\nare very politically fraught
projects.
This is one of the\nprojects that I've
been paying the\nclosest attention
to for a site in Venice.
And the architects on the\nproject are Gonzalez Goodale.
And it's a former--
it's a Metro bus yard that\nwill be turned into housing
for about 150, about 150 beds.
And this is a project in Mike\nBonin, Council Member Bonin's
office.
Which I have learned,\nthese are projects
that have to thread a really\nremarkable number of needles.
They have to be done\non a very quick budget,
on a very tight\nframe, and they have
to be both efficient enough\nto please those voters who
want them to look like\nnothing more like barracks,
but also be humane enough to\nconvince people to come off
the street and be workable for\nthem in terms of their needs.
So those projects are\ncontinuing to roll out.
And as Diane mentioned,\nmy role often
is to sort of act\nas a go between
and vet some of the ideas\nfrom architects in town
and think about which ones\nare feasible for this project,
given the really remarkable set\nof constraints that they face.
So you heard about the Olympics.
We did have an Olympics\nin this first LA.
We had a 1932 Olympics.
We had an Olympics in 1984\nthat was really remarkable
in its design\nstrategy, mostly led
by Jon Jerde's office and\nDeborah Sussman, which
really was an expression.
Even in the color palette alone\nwas an expression of LA's role
as I would say,\nemerging sense of itself
as a Pacific Rim city.
So a color palette\nthat really borrowed
from Latin America and Asia.
And here's Deborah Sussman\nat an exhibition of her work
that Barbara Bestor and others\norganized in Los Angeles.
She was really a pioneer\nof super graphics
and a lot of environmental\ngraphics work
that was truly remarkable.
And her Olympics\ndesign strategy was
most impressive for\nreally representing
the sensibility and the\noptimism of Los Angeles
at that moment in 1984.
So now we have an\nopportunity to think
about what a design strategy\nfor 2028 might look like.
And in closing, this is the--
I started with a\nstreet level view
to emphasize my interest in\nthe street and the sidewalk.
This is a slightly\nmore elevated view.
This is the view from\nmy office, actually.
And I work on the 13th\nfloor of City Hall.
Looking out over\nBunker Hill, which
is the part of downtown\nthat's very much in flux.
And this view\nreally does suggest
where Los Angeles\nfinds itself, I think,
in terms of its effort to\nre-animate its public sphere
and also what it's had to\nrecover from in that effort.
So like many cities,\nLA embraced urban rule
quite dramatically\nand nowhere more
dramatically than\non Bunker Hill where
a collection of Victorian\nhouses and rooming houses
and apartment\nbuildings were replaced
in a really aggressive sort\nof gouging of the Earth
with these super blocks which\neven now-- there is City Hall
Tower.
So my office is right\nup here somewhere.
Replaced with the city, with\nthese mega blocks that the city
is even now still filling in.
I showed you that tower\nby Handel Architects
is one of the last pieces\nof that hill to fill in.
So even this little\nsquare of the city,
if you know how\nto read it right,
suggests the layers of history,\nreinvention, expulsion, et
cetera, that have remade this\nsmall patch of Los Angeles
over the last three\nquarters of a century
and of the work that\nremains to be done.
I showed you an\nimage from CicLAvia
was right along this\nstretch of Grand Avenue.
So the new federal\ncourthouse, the Board
by Diller Scorfidio and Renfro,\nWalt Disney Concert Hall.
One of the great\npublic buildings
the Los Angeles, the\nDepartment of Water and Power
by AC Martin.
A new park, Grand Park, that\nwas opened about five years ago.
And then this little\ncorner will be a city park
by OMA and Mia Lehrer, an\nLA-based landscape architect.
Sort of finally filling\nin these last pieces.
And this is an urban\nrenewal process that
started as early as the 1940s.
And even now, we're\njust beginning
to fill in the\nlast little pieces.
So with that, I will thank\nyou for your attention
and really encourage all\nof you to be in touch.
Thank you.
[applause]
And I'm happy to\ntake some questions.
Yes, we do have time.
I think we have at least\n15 minutes for questions.
OK.
Anyone want to get started?
John?
Thank you, Christopher.
My question is about the\nrapidly shifting economics
around design firms\nin Los Angeles.
I mean, it's really in\nNorth America in general,
maybe globally really,\nwhich is to say
that one of the features\nof neoliberalism
is clearly one in which\nsomething like a vertically
disintegrated company\nlike Amazon or Walmart
can actually, amazingly,\nthrough technology extend
its global reach, in ways\nthat the late 19th century
vertically integrated company\ncould never have dreamed.
Right?
And I think in the same\nway that we don't really
have community banks anymore,\nwe are increasingly--
I mean, as someone who runs a\nyoung practice in Los Angeles,
we find ourselves\nincreasingly up
against global giants for\ncertain kinds of design
projects.
And we are always astonished\nthat a AE Kahn or Gensler even
wants a piece of any of this.
What, of course, we\nare also aware of
is that they are rapidly\nbuying up medium-sized firms.
And so I guess I'm wondering,\nin all of the projects that you
have and things you're seeing\nand come across your desk
and whether that's a\npiece of the conversation,
because it seems\nto me, ironically,
having been in LA more\nthan a decade now,
the city is booming\nlike never before.
And yet we\nincreasingly don't even
look to Los Angeles\nas a place where
we're going to find\ncertain kinds of projects
that might move us from a\nsmall firm to a medium firm.
Right.
It's a really\nimportant question.
And it's actually\nsomething Mark Lee
and I were talking\nabout just last night.
And it really gets back to\nthe question of procurement.
So when I talk to colleagues\nwho have-- as Diane mentioned,
there's no specific equivalent\nin another American city,
but there are people\ndoing similar work.
Justin Moore in the New York of\nthe Public Design Commission.
There are others\naround the country
who I went to for some advice\nbefore I started this job.
And I would say\nto a person, they
all said the place where you\ncan have the most impact,
but will face the toughest\nchallenges is around
the issue of procurement.
So they all said, make friends\nwith some procurement lawyers.
Figure out how that works.
Figure out how the\ndifferent departments
make those decisions.
And then, it's absolutely\ncrucial to making sure
that we can have a\ndifferent, I would say,
ecosystem of firms\nfirst of all, being
competitive for public\nwork and also in turn,
given how much we're\ninvesting in this city,
also then supporting\nthat ecosystem
of small and mid-sized firms.
You know, I showed that\nimage of all those architects
on the beach in 1980.
First of all, obviously\nall white male
architects, but also\nat a moment where
maybe the last kind\nof moment where there
was the kind of free wheeling\ndesign culture and the ability
to find young clients and\nsites to do experimental work.
LA sort of still has\nthat reputation sometimes
and outside of LA,\nbut it hasn't been
that way since the mid '80s\nprobably or certainly not
since 1990.
So this is a real\nchallenge and a focus
of mine in terms of how we\ncan change that equation.
So part of the way that\nI've thought about it
is conceptualizing, thinking\nabout the city as a client
and how we can define that\nin very specific ways.
It also means\nlooking for ways when
some of the projects I showed\nare underway and the RFP,
and you know, RFQ, is\nalready out the door,
there are a number\nof projects where
I'll still you know\nhopefully have a chance
to be working on\nthe RFP and think
about specific language\nthat can be both elevating
design as a requirement,\ngiven the extent
to which some of those\nare really quantified
projects that have rankings.
I went to meeting\nmy second week where
there was a big public\nproject and they
had all the categories ranked.
And architecture was literally\nat the bottom of that list.
So part of it is thinking about\nthat process, but part of it
is also thinking about ways to\nwork within the existing world.
So I showed you the G2\npiece along the river.
And I'll go back to\nthat for a second.
One way that we've engaged\nwith some architects
about our conversation here\nis that there's already
contracts with\nlandscape architects
and a big engineering firm.
And so we can bring\nsome architects probably
on this early\nactivation as subs.
And so the list of architects\nwe could go to, of course,
gets much broader right away.
But I think we also\nhave to rethink what
the on-call list looks like.
You know, there are\nvarious departments
that have on-call lists.
Bureau of Engineering has one\nthat could be probably broader.
And that's only for\npublic projects.
So that's to say nothing\nof the private projects
and how we encourage that.
So I think the way\nthat I've been thinking
about framing it is that--
I showed you some of the private\nhouses of the post-war city.
You know, to try to think about\nthe innovation experimentation
that marked that work and try\nto figure out, although it's
very difficult, how to\ndrag some of that spirit
into the public work.
Because we really\nare investing in
projects that touch\non the public realm
to a really\nunprecedented degree.
And that's easier\nsaid than done.
Clearly convincing a\nbig agency like Metro
which is a county agency or our\nBureau of Engineering to think
about design is really central\nto the mission of what they're
doing is a change.
There are some allies.
There's a woman,\nDeborah Weintraub
who works in Bureau of\nEngineering who has really
made promoting good\ndesign a priority.
So it's partially about finding\nallies in those departments.
But I think it's really\naround the specifics
of the procurement process\nand what that looks like.
So we're doing a replacement\nfor the Parker Center just east
of City Hall.
And that will be a\nkind of an experiment
in a public-private\npartnership in a city building,
but the city will\ncontrol the process.
So as we write the RFQ\nfor the consultant teams,
I think, I hope there'll\nbe an opportunity
to focus on some\nof these things.
Good question though.
Thank you so much for your talk.
So I have a question about\nto go back to housing.
And so Proposition\n10 is on the ballot
in the state of\nCalifornia to repeal
Costa-Hawkins, which\nwill allow cities
to implement rent control.
But Los Angeles has rent control\nto buildings built before 1978.
Right.
So which is roughly the age\nthat building since start
to become historic.
And so my question is\nabout the relationship
between affordability, historic\npreservation, and this push
for experimentation in\ndevelopment, in new design,
in housing construction.
And so I just wanted\nto hear more about that
and how you think--
how you make sense\nof that relationship
between those\ncompeting interests?
Right.
So Prop 10, which will be\non the ballot in the fall,
will repeal Costa-Hawkins\nwhich did not
allow cities to apply rent\ncontrol to new projects
essentially.
And so it will allow all of\nthe new volume of construction,
residential construction, to\nbe subject to rent control
if cities decide to do that.
And there's a kind of split\nwithin the housing advocacy
groups about what the precise\nimpacts of that will be.
The mayor has come\nout in support of it.
I think what's clear\nis that we need
to be thinking about\nhousing, the housing question
and both sides, ends\nof the spectrum, which
is to say we have\nto produce more,
but we also have to be thinking\nmuch more strategically
about tenant protections and\nrent control and other ways
of keeping people in place.
And you're right to\nraise the question
of historic preservation,\nwhich sometimes
has been a rather disingenuous\nway for neighborhoods
to fight new housing production.
And so to the extent that I'm\ninterested in preservation
for more recent\nbuildings, that will
have to done be done in a very\nlimited strategic way, that
doesn't take huge numbers\nof existing housing units
off the market as\nit were or freeze
those neighborhoods in amber.
The politics of housing are\nextraordinarily complicated
in Los Angeles.
The protection for single\nfamily neighborhoods
in terms of political clout\nis still remarkably strong.
And there's a lot of concern\nabout what additional housing
production will mean in those\nneighborhoods and others.
I have found though, that\ndespite a lot of talk
about a huge gulf between sort\nof the NIMBY and YIMBY ends
of that spectrum, most people\nthat I talked to in LA fall
into the middle between\nthose polls, which is to say,
they realize that we have\nunderproduced housing
and that's one of many reasons\nfor the affordability crisis
that we face.
And they have some\nreasonable concerns
about what that new\nproduction looks
like in their neighborhoods.
But the underproduction\nis really important
to emphasize all the time.
The most recent study\nsuggests that in LA county,
over the last three decades\nor so since the down zoning
and slow growth\nmovements of the 1980s,
we passed something\ncalled Prop U in LA
in the middle 1980s that down\nzoned significant sections
of the city.
We've underproduced\nin LA county something
like a million\nhousing units in terms
of what we should have produced\nto match our population growth.
So that's not the only reason\nfor the affordability crisis
but it's certainly one of them.
In a city that had been\nknown for headlong growth
and production, we really\nput the brakes on that effort
starting in the '80s.
So I think we have to be\nthinking about new sites
and strategies for producing\nnew housing, affordable
and market rate.
And we have to be thinking\nmore strategically
about new protections\nfor tenants
and rent control strategies.
And it will be\ninteresting to see.
So Prop 10 will be on\nthe ballot Meanwhile,
a state senator named Scott\nWiener from San Francisco
proposed a very aggressive\npro housing bill last year
called SB, Senate bill 827,\nwhich died in committee, which
would have allowed significant\nnew densities of new housing
production along\ntransit lines, which
he defined early in the\nbill as close to transit,
close to rail, and\nmajor bus lines.
And it would have, in\nthe earliest versions,
allowed most of the LA\nbasin to be up zoned
in a really dramatic\nway up to 85 feet,
although that was in single\nfamily neighborhoods,
even that was later modified.
He didn't really build\na coalition with the,
I think even he would\nadmit, with the other side
of the spectrum, which is\nto say the tenant protection
and displacement groups\nthat are working active
and those questions,\nwhich are really crucial.
He will be presenting--\nhe just announced
this week a new version of\nthat bill sometime next year.
And I think it will\nbear the products
of a lot of\nconversations he's had
with folks on the other\nend of that spectrum.
And so we'll see what the\nnew version looks like.
So, you know, my parents--
I grew up in Berkeley.
They still live in the house\nthat they bought in 1972.
And you know, they're part\nof that generation which
has been extraordinarily\nfortunate, not only
because housing production\nreally slowed down,
if not stopped in many\nparts of the state
after they bought their houses.
They also had the benefit\nof Proposition 13.
And a lot of other\nchanges, regulations
that have served\ncollectively to really slow
the production of new housing.
So there is beginning to be\na conversation about Prop
13 reform, or\n[inaudible] reform,
what those things look like.
And those are still\npolitically fraught issues,
but I think they need to be at\nthe very least on the table.
[inaudible]
Go ahead.
Can I go ahead?
Sure.
Go ahead and then we'll\nget that one next.
OK.
My question about building--
Oh, where are you?
Oh, you're up there.
Wait a minute.
We've got one question here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You wrote about Pereira's LACMA\nbeing a lid on a boiling pot,
I remember, sort of\nultimately unsatisfying
move for what artists and\narchitects wanted in LA.
Hence Ruscha's painting\nof it burning down.
And that was a public building\nthat was controlled by,
I think a few private\ntrustees and stakeholders.
And I guess my\nquestion is, do you
envision any sort of trouble\nbetween public and private
interests in the implementation\nof those shaped projects?
Or perhaps the contemporary\nart and architecture
ideas being tapped\nby a sort of I
don't know unwillingness\nto sort of move forward?
Right.
So the question was\nabout LACMA and also
about the ways in which\nthese new initiatives might
be tamped down.
I mean, the politics of\nthis are complicated.
And I knew, when I took the job\nwhere most of the minefields
were, but of course,\nit looks different
once you get you\nknow to see these,
you get the perspective\nof being inside City Hall.
I think the particular,\nthis is something Diane
and I were talking about.
There's an interesting\nset of questions
about where it makes more\nsense to fold something
into your policy\nchange, as I mentioned,
or where it makes more\nsense to actually try
to build a prototype of\nsomething that can be
a model of a new way of using\nthe city you're living in,
the city.
And so I think I'm\ntrying to strike
a balance between those two.
But you know, Pereira\nis also the subject
of another preservation question\naround my old employer's
building, the LA Times,\nwhich was in a '30s building
by Gordon Kaufmann\nwith a '40s edition
and then a '70s wing\nby William Pereira.
The paper has moved\nwest to El Segundo
and leaving that building in\na little bit of preservation
limbo.
There's an interesting set of\nquestions about the Pereira
addition to that project.
So I think there is support\nand interest in some more
experimental projects.
I think the shade issue will\nbe a really interesting test.
I think the Olympics--
you know, Olympics has a really\ninteresting legacy in LA.
Unlike most Olympic\ncities, it is
connected to public space\nand corridors and tree canopy
to a certain extent rather\nthan architectural icons
like the Bird's Nest,\nfor example, in Beijing.
So in 1932, a lot of the\npalm trees in Los Angeles
were planted for\nthe '32 Olympics.
They don't give a lot\nof shade, obviously,
but they did give a kind of\ncharacter to those corridors.
Olympic Boulevard\nin Los Angeles is
called that because it was 10th\nStreet and the '32 Olympics
was the 10th Olympiad.
And so 10th Street was\nrenamed Olympic Boulevard.
The '84 Olympics was very,\nas I showed in that image,
very much an economical,\nsuper pragmatic set of design
solutions.
Actually a kind of scaffolding\nthat Jerde's office and Deborah
Sussman put together.
So there is beginning to be\na conversation about what
preparations for\nthe Olympics might
mean for the corridors and\nthe public spaces of the city
as opposed to the venues\nthat other cities have
had to think about building.
We are in the\nprivileged position
of not having to build any major\nnew venues for the Olympics.
And so we can\nconcentrate our attention
on how people get\nto those venues
or how they move through\nthe city 10 years from now.
And I think those conversations\nwill include discussions
about tree canopy, but\nalso we're, you know,
getting ready to renegotiate\nthe street furniture
contract, which may be\nanother place to fold
in a conversation about shade.
And as I mentioned,\nthere are a lot
of things that we ask developers\nto do in the right of way
still, many of which are\nnot super positive in terms
of remaking streets.
And so I think we can revisit\nthat conversation about what
exactly we're asking\nprivate developers to do
in the right of way and the\nextent to which they might be
responsible for thinking about\nshading that territory in front
of new projects.
So I think it will require a\nnumber of different strategies.
[inaudible]
Thank you for coming to talk.
My question is in regards to\nthe scales of the projects that
were mentioned throughout\nthe presentation and just
the consistency that\nthey're all very large,
but they kind of take on\ndifferent roles in the city.
The lateral tower,\nthe vertical tower,
the large plot of land\nnext to the LA river,
the transportation projects.
This is kind of the\nresidual to the scale of LA
and the kind of pressures\nthat exist in LA.
Do you see that as\nsomething inherently local
to LA, that there\nare pressures there
that request a\nproject of that scale?
And then to kind\nof parse out what
would be the driver behind\nthinking of those scales
and are the drivers the same\nfor these different projects?
Right, right.
I think its true about\nthe images that I showed.
But I think I used that opening\nimage to suggest that I'm also
quite interested in the\nhyper-local and small scale
of the sidewalk and a number\nof small scale projects
in terms of housing.
I will mention one thing\non the smaller scale
too, before I get to\nthe larger question.
There have been some cities\nthat have looked at fourplexes
as a really interesting\nlocus for experimentation
in single family or low density\nresidential neighborhoods,
Minneapolis in particular.
State of California has pushed,\nin a very productive way,
cities to allow ADUs, so-called\ngranny flats in single family
neighborhoods.
I'm really interested\nin whether it
might be possible to do a design\ncompetition or a collaboration
with an affordable\nhousing developer
to produce a couple\nof fourplexes
with a young office or two to\nsuggest the ways in which we
need to go even\nfurther past, you
know, the kind of modest density\nthat is added with an ADU.
And I think we have to be\nmoving more aggressively.
But also in ways\nthat match sometimes
the scale of existing\nneighborhoods,
given the political complexities\nof changing density.
And they are neighborhoods\nof Los Angeles.
So if you ask even those\nsingle family homeowners who
are most opposed to growth\nand housing production,
to get back to the housing\nquestion, what they want
to see in their\nneighborhoods, they
will often mention\nthings like walkability,
support for local retail,\nthe ability to age in place,
the ability for younger\nbuyers or renters
to get a foothold in different\nneighborhoods across the city.
And all of those\nthings are actually
promoted by a thoughtful\nfourplex for example, which
could be four\ndetached units or it
could be four units\nin a single structure.
And that is as an\nexample of where
I'm really interested in\nworking at that smaller scale
and seeing what's possible and\nactually seeing whether it's
possible to execute something\nlike that on a relatively
quick time scale.
In terms of a larger\nquestion and the pressures,
yes, the pressures of\nthe city and the way
we have shaped the city have\nbeen done at the macro scale
to a large extent because of\nthe sheer scale of the basin
and Los Angeles itself.
And the challenge of transit,\ntransit expansion, for example,
is expanding across\nthat giant territory.
And there has been\na tradition of,
for all of LA's civic\nfragmentation, for all of its,
let's say governance\ncomplexity, there have been,
in moments of real\ncrisis, the city
has figured-- the region\nhas figured out how
to respond at a macro scale.
So in terms of water,\nin terms of air quality
in the post-war decades and\nnow in terms of transit,
there has been an ability for\nthe region to come together
on these larger issues.
It really only tends to\nhappen in moments of crisis.
And so, we're facing another one\nobviously with climate change
and what the response will\nbe in terms of land use
policy across the\nregion, that's probably
the next test of that\nthesis that we're actually
able to throw off\nthe fragmentation
when a real crisis is facing us.
We'll see because we\nhave one right now.
That's such a good answer.
I don't want to extend\nthis too long, but I just
want to ask one final question,\nbecause I'm really struck--
I'm struck a lot by your origins\nin architectural historian.
Because in a lot of the\nconversation and the project
you share, the idea, that kind\nof vernacular architecture.
The history, memory,\nmeaning of the iconicity of,
what does it mean to\npeople is very much
embedded in your\nappreciation for the history
of architectural form and sites.
Great photographs,\nhistorical archives.
So I'm wondering\nif you could say
just a few things\nabout attention
that, whether you have\nattention with the planners,
because one thing, I'm very\ninterested in history myself.
But one thing I've always\nfound in any planning
department I've taught\nin, planner's are all
about the future.
They're not necessarily always\nthinking about the past.
Here you are working side by\nside in a planning department
that's focused\ntowards the future,
but you bring to\nbear a sensibility
about the history and the past.
So where I see a\npotential tension
is exactly on the\nissue of densification.
And how do move\nthrough a climate
change future where\nmobility and transport
and sprawl and the size of\nthe city is beyond control.
But if we are preserving\nthe vernacular architecture,
it's not high density.
So how do you work--
I mean, that's only one example,\nbut what strategies do you use
and how do you start that\nconversation to think
about the past, the\nhistory because that's
part of the project of\nmaking it the city again.
And the presentist problems\nthat planners are constantly
dealing with.
It is absolutely fair to\nsay that bringing together
a bunch of historians\nand artists and scholars
to think about memory\nis not a particularly
tidy fit with the bureaucracy,\nthe larger bureaucracy.
But that's part of what\nmakes a project like that
compelling to me, is\ntrying to make it fit
or trying to put those two\nthings next to each other
and see what happens.
Part of the interest is my own\nfrustration with the histories
that many of us didn't learn and\nwe continue not to teach people
in Los Angeles.
So Union Station,\nfor example, which
is our most important\npre-war monument
sits on the side of Chinatown.
So before even urban renewal,\nwe did a version of that
all across Los Angeles.
We razed an entire Chinese\nimmigrant neighborhood
that was thriving to make\nway for this train station.
And the way that we talked about\nthe history of Chavez Ravine,
for example.
I think most people\nknow that it was
a thriving Mexican-American\nneighborhood that
was cleared to make way for\nwhat's now Dodger Stadium.
What people leave out\nis that it was actually
cleared to make way\nfor a housing, a very
optimistic public housing\nproject that was then
killed by fears of housing\nas a kind of leading
edge of socialism in the\n1950s in Los Angeles, which
in those days was a very\npolitical, very politically
conservative city.
So some of it is\nfrustration with the stories
that I didn't learn.
And that I still don't\nthink that we teach
as effectively as we might.
But in a larger sense, I\nthink there's an opportunity.
I think there is--
I'm very interested\nin carving out space
for the speculative project.
And I showed the\nhighway projects
that, when I was a critic\nI was interested in doing
that sort of activist\ncriticism, which
is to say using that\nplatform to make proposals
for the future of the\ncity, some of which
are politically complicated,\nsome much less so.
But I think that\nhas to be married
with a conversation about\nthe history of the city,
given that the stereotypes\nand tropes of the second Los
Angeles, as I've described\nit, this postwar city,
can't be separated\nfrom efforts beginning
as early as the teens\nand '20s, probably
before that, by an\nemerging class of Anglo
leads to whitewash what was a\nvery complicated multi-ethnic,
multi-racial history of a city\nthat, of course, was Spanish
and then Mexican before\nit was Native American,
then it was Spanish,\nthen it was Mexican,
before it was Californian\nand then American.
And so the whole--
when I begin with an image\nof a Case Study project,
that for me it's\ninformed by the notion
that a lot of those myths\nor tropes of Los Angeles
came out of an\neffort by the people
around the LA Times, the\nmayors at that point,
you know, people at these\ninstitutions where I've
worked to really whitewash.
And the term comes\nfrom a historian
Bill Deverell who's\na friend of mine
has a great book\ncalled Whitewashed
Adobe, from an effort\nto whitewash that very
complicated past,\nto promote this city
as a kind of Republican\npro-business, you know,
let's say anti-labor city\nin the post-war decades.
And that was completely\nbound up with the kind
of architectural production\nthat was happening.
And so, that story\ndoesn't typically
get told in all\nof its complexity.
And it is difficult\nin the position
I'm in to tell that\nkind of a story
while I'm working\nwithin the framework
that I'm working, but.
I think the Mayor is interested\nin an attempt to do that
and more.
We'll see where it goes.
Amazing.
I think all planners should be\nknowing the history of where
they're coming from,\nbecause there's
lessons embedded in them,\nas you've clearly said so.
Let's give Christopher\nand round of applause.
Well, thank you.
Thank you for having me.
