Hi everybody.
Hi, I'm Diane Davis.
I'm the chair of the Department\nof Urban Planning and Design,
and I'm going to get us started\nbecause we are actually-
this event is going to go\nuntil 1:30 and not 2:00.
And I don't want to take\naway too much time from us--
this collective group to be\nable to have the great pleasure
to listen to Richard Sennett\nspeak to us today about--
possibly about his\nnew book, but also
a series of projects that he's\nbeen working on for a while.
The title of his lecture\nis called "The Open City"
and we'll hear more\nabout that in a second.
Again, I don't want to\ntake up too much time to--
well actually I could not\npossibly begin to, kind of,
reiterate everything\nthat you need
to know about Richard Sennett.
His bio, the number of\nawards that he's had,
the kind of esteem\nthat he's held
in many different\ndisciplines related
to design, sociology, history.
You name it, he's kind of one of\nthe leading intellectual voices
of contemporary, I can't\neven say American, academia,
but also globally\nworking now in and living
in London part of his time.
I do want to say that\nhe's a professor at both--
a professor of the\nhumanities at NYU
as well as a professor of\nsociology at the London School
of Economics and\nPolitical Science.
And the chair of\n[? theater mundy, ?]
an organization\nwe might actually
hear a little more about.
He's been a visiting--
distinguished\nvisitor and recipient
of awards at multiple major\nuniversities around the world,
including Cambridge\nUniversity, universities
in Germany, Italy, et cetera.
But the other\nthing that I wanted
to mention a little bit\nabout Richard Sennett's
extraordinarily deep and\nimportant published work.
If you take a look at\nhis CV and the number--
he's basically published a\nbook like every other year
from maybe 1970 or\nsomething like that.
On a personal note,\nI want to mention
that when I was in\ncollege in Chicago
I remember reading one\nof his first books,
it was not the first one,\n"Families Against The City."
An amazing book about, kind\nof, migration, culture, equity,
inequality, and, kind of,\ncollective consciousness that
blew my mind as an\nurban sociology major.
Probably had something\nto do with continuing
to study sociology myself.
And he's written a\nseries of major books
that you all have heard about.
"The Uses Of\nDisorder," "The Fall
Of Public Man," a book on\nauthority, "Flesh and Stone:
The Body and the City in\nWestern Civilization,"
"The Conscience of the Eye."
And these last two\nare really oriented
towards the design\nprofessions in ways
that maybe the\nearlier books were
oriented towards\nhistorical urban sociology.
A book called, "Respect\nin a World of Inequality,"
"The Culture of New Capitalism."
I'm going to ask\nyou about capitalism
later actually because\nthat's kind of dropped out.
It's come and gone\nin your [? ove. ?]
More recently in\n2008 "The Craftsman"
which also a really\nwell received book.
And recently in 2012 Yale\nUniversity Press, "Together:
The Rituals, Pleasures and\nPolitics of Cooperation."
I'm wondering whether in that\nespecially that last issue
of how people work\ntogether, or live together,
is a theme that has gone\nway back to families
against a city.
It's threaded through\nmost of your work,
and I think it's\ngoing to be part
of what you\'re talking about\nin your lecture on "The Open
City."
So without further ado, my--
I'm so pleased to\nintroduce Richard Sennett.
[applause]
Thank you.
You know that I\nwas a student here.
I was a architectural\ndropout, so I
went into Arts and\nSciences, because I
couldn't hack architecture.
But I've taught here\noff and on all my life,
and I'm teaching Elements now.
And it's really such\na pleasure for me.
This is really home\nfor me, the GSD.
So I'm really glad to be here.
What I thought I would do\ntoday, is describe to you
some ideas that\noriented me and others
who have worked on a project\nfor the UN called Habitat.
Habitat is a project of\nhuman habitat UNESCO.
And please do not ask me why\nthe Americans have dropped out
of UNESCO.
I'm so sick about\ntalking about this.
UN-Habitat, UNESCO, the\nWorld Bank and the IMF.
And it takes a look at the\nstate of the global environment
once every 20 years.
Now I'm so old that I attended\nthe first of this in 1976.
And this was my third\nHabitat meeting,
and I was one of\nthe chairs of it.
I don't think I'll\nmake it to Habitat IV,
but I want to describe to you\nwhat we were trying to do.
Basically, in the\nintellectual part of Habitat--
which concluded a\nyear ago in Quito,
and whose scientific papers--\nthat is academic papers--
are published next\nweek by Elsevier--
a huge pile of these papers.
What we were trying to do is\nput together an idea of planning
and an idea of design.
That is a very GSD-like project.
But we were trying to\ndo this in a context
where, more and\nmore, particularly
in the developing world, they're\nseparated to the detriment
of both.
So I'm going to just\ntalk a little about how
we try to see the physical and\nthe social parts of the city
together.
I haven't talked\nabout this before.
So tell me if something\ndoesn't resonate.
You tell me.
But the idea about\nthis is to understand
what a city should\nbe in its physical,
and its socioeconomic\nand political economy.
How do you put\nthose two together?
In my own view, what\na city should be
is a place which\nenriches experience.
And that means,\npractically, a question
of opening up\nopportunities economically.
But socially and\npsychologically,
it means managing complexity.
That an open city is one\nin which people become--
thanks to the way\nthe city operates,
and the way it's designed--
becomes a place in\nwhich people are
more and more\nskilled in managing
complex conditions of\nlife, and taking advantage
of opportunities which are\nunforeseen, accidental, et
cetera.
Now I would say that cities\ntoday are not enabling either.
They're becoming particularly--\nunder the aegis of global
capitalism--
ever more rigid,\ncrude, and closed.
Jacob Burckhardt, the\n19th century historian,
talked about the age\nof brutal simplifiers.
He meant nationalism.
He looked forward to Trump.
But I think in urbanism today,\nwe are in a different way,
under the shadow of this\nage of brutal simplifiers.
And in Habitat III,\nI and my group--
which is Ricky Burdett\nand Saskia Sassen--
asked what we might do to\nopen the city physically up,
so that people's experience\nin it could be more complex,
and their ability to manage\ndifficulty and complexity
could expand.
And before I go on\nto describe this,
I want to thank Clay, who\nwas one of our researchers
on this project.
The UN is not, I must say, a\nvery efficient organization.
And Clay managed to deal with\nher inefficiencies beautifully.
One thing we tried to\ndo in looking as concept
of the open city,\nwas to take it not
so much as a kind of\nplanning instrument,
but as a set of\npropositions that people
would bounce off of, and\nreact to either positively
or negatively.
But it's an idea that tries\nto see the city whole.
So let me start by saying,\nwhat does complexity mean?
For Aristotle, it\nmeant synoikismos.
That is, a coming together\nof oikai, which are
like extended family groups.
And famously, you may know,\nthat he wrote in the Politics,
that a city cannot come\ninto being by people who are
the same.
It has to come into being--
the gathering\ntogether the synergy--
of people who are different--
These different oikai.
Practically, that meant-- in\nterms of combining people--
for the sake of defense,\nor for the sake of trade.
But it also means\nsomething politically,
which is, people learning\nhow to account points of view
unlike one's own.
That is, to acquire\nthe skills to deal
with people unlike oneself.
So this notion of\nsynoikismos contains in it
an idea that there is a\nkind of craft required
to be able to identify,\nunderstand, combat,
and work with people who\nare different than oneself.
It's a fundamental,\nit seems to me,
principle of urbanism ethically.
When we started out confronted\nby masses of planning
statistics about growth patterns\nin various parts of Central
Africa and Southeast Asia,\nwe looked at this large body
of reports and so on.
And Saskia Sassen said, let's\njust junk it for the moment,
and let's ask ourselves\nwhat it means ethically
for a person to develop the\nskill for dealing with people
to practice synoikismos.
The UN officials, they\nblanched a bit, but we did it.
And here is my own\ntake on how this works.
The ethical\nframework for dealing
with people who\nare unlike oneself,
is exemplified in a classic\nconflict between two
Jewish theologians--
Martin Buber and\nEmmanuel Levinas.
For Buber-- as those of you,\nwhether you are Jewish or not,
may know--
the idea of the ethical\nrelationship between people
is expressed as an\nI-thou relationship.
That is, that the more that\nyou know about somebody
else, or interact with them,\nthe more intimate and closer
you come to them.
It's hard to render in English,\nbut it's the difference
between you and thou.
You is impersonal.
Thou is a more personal--
[? ich ?] und Du in\nGerman, and so on.
The idea for Buber,\ntherefore, was
that if you mix people together\nthe more they interact,
the more they'll\nunderstand each other.
Whereas for Levinas,\nthe important thing
was the dash that\nseparates I and thou.
That is to say that there is\nan unbridgeable difference
between people when\nthey come together.
They don't integrate,\nthey don't unite,
they don't form a community.
Instead, they become\nneighbors to each other.
And the concept of\nneighbor, for Levinas,
is somebody who is aware\nof another intensely,
but is separated by that dash\nfrom ever fully becoming one
with them.
And this, to me--
and you'll see in these\nmassive statistical reports--
is a kind of insight that\nwe've tried to apply--
this Levinasian notion\nof the neighbor--
to the urban condition.
It requires skill to\nbe intensely aware
of somebody else, to\ninteract with them,
and yet not to try and abolish\nthe boundaries between self
and other.
It's a particularly\nurban concept
because the Levinasian\nversion of the neighbor,
is something that allows\nstrangers to remain stranger
in some sense, to each other.
Which doesn't suppose the\nlocal community is ultimately
the ethical\nfoundation of a city--
it's moral foundation.
That people can remain\napart, and yet mutually
aware and interactive.
So this notion of\nthe neighbor is
a peculiarly urban condition.
So the question was, it's not\njust a matter of a good heart.
It's a skill in dealing\nwith that hyphen.
And the question for\nus was, how do we
translate this into the every\nday experience of people
in cities?
I took a step long\nago, in my own mind,
towards answering this\nquestion, when I worked at MIT.
You know that place\nthat's down the river?
I taught planning\nthere for a while.
And my office was\nnext to the Media Lab.
And a lot of the people--\nthis is in the 90s--
in the Media Lab at that time,\nwere interested in Open Systems
Theory.
And for me, I began to fill\nin this kind of ethical vision
early in my own thinking,\nby thinking about the city
as an open system--
that the more open\nit is, the more
this peculiar urban condition\nof neighborliness can develop.
What do we mean\nby an open system?
What I remember\nfrom that time is
that the Media Lab\nwas filled with people
reinventing the world.
They made a contrast\nbetween open and closed
via a a contrast\nbetween Microsoft--
which was a donor\nto the Media Lab--
and themselves.
They thought of a Microsoft\nexperiment as closed,
and a Media Lab\nexperiment as open.
What does this mean?
First of all, it\nmeant exploration--
open-- versus\nhypothesis testing--
which is closed.
Second, it meant a non-linear\nprocess of research--
as in a rolling experiment--
versus a predictable\npath of outcomes.
It's the difference,\nin mathematical terms,
between Boolean logic--
which is yes-no logic--
and Bayesian logic--\nwhich is a more open--
in which the word\nmay be, or it's
probable, but not certain--
comes in.
That introduces an\nelement of nonlinearity.
And finally, it\nintroduced the notion of--
very proud of-- the\nability to fail,
and to learn from failure.
Whereas, the economics\nof a closed system
are such that failure\nis not an option.
That you always have\nto produce a result
rather than abort a problem.
All of these-- as I saw from\nthe work that these Media Lab
people were doing--
had a kind of ethical\ndimension which many of them
didn't know about.
Because they were\ncelebrating the open--
openness to the unknown.
They were celebrating the\nother in Levinasian terms,
rather than familiar\ninteractions with which people
became more and more familiar.
So I began to think then,\nhow would a city model itself
on this kind of an open system?
And that's-- as I said--\nthis was long before I worked
for the UN, I've worked for\nthe UN for 40 years off and on.
But I didn't put this together\nwith the planning work I was
doing for the UN at the time.
But I began to think, even\nbefore practical things which
I'm going to show you, that the\ntranslation of an open system
into a city has three aspects.
First, that socially, an\nopen city is dialogical--
that economically, an\nopen city is synchronous--
and that politically,\nan open city
is always to the left\nof its nation state.
These have become\nguiding principles for me
in thinking about\nthe city as open,
and I'd like to explain them.
The term dialogical,\nas you probably know,
is derived from Mikhail\nBakhtin, the literary critic,
but also social critic, put to\ndeath by Stalin in the 1930s.
It focuses on the\nprocess of exchange
and the unlikely\nprocesses of exchange--
first of all, in\nliterature-- but secondly,
in ordinary language\ncommunication,
rather than looking at\ndiscourse as a means to the end
of taking a decision.
I don't know of any of you\nstudy decision-making theory.
It's fundamentally\nhostile to the notion
that discourse is a means\nto an end, which puts an end
to discourse itself.
The idea about this, as it\nbecomes something in the city,
is the unified action, or the\ndecision to act together--
that kind of coming together\nin that Martin Buber way--
is something that is replaced\nby a notion of a process, which
is more important than\nthe plan that it makes.
Very hard for us\nto think that way.
We think about\nplanning as you talk,
you look at the alternatives,\nyou make a decision,
and then you do it.
That's not dialogical.
The dialogical thing is always\na rolling self-edit of a plan.
A plan is a proposition which\nis completely, if you like,
subject to feedback.
In the World Bank--
to just translate this\ninto practical terms--
we have come-- or\nthey, I have to say--
they have come to understand the\ndialogical principles are ways
to avoid many of the\ntop-down, rigid, and often
disastrous decisions they took\nabout finance development.
People are trained in\nlistening skills and learning
to be silent, using\nnon-combative language,
and most of all,\nspeaking informally,
rather than always to the point.
It creates messy and\ninefficient meetings,
but they're also much\nmore involving because
of their very informality.
And this is something\nthat is, I think,
built into any open system.
That it's dialogical in\nfocusing on self-correcting
or self-revising processes,\nrather than looking
at discourse as a\nmeans-to-the-end of action.
The second aspect of\nan open city to me,
economically, is\nit's synchronicity--
which simply means that many\nthings are happening at once.
This goes back to Aristotle.
When Aristotle thought\nabout the synoikismos, what
he was thinking about is that\nall these different oikai,
these tribes I guess\nyou could call them--
in Greek they're called tritis--
anyhow, let's not go there--
that they did different things.
So his question was,\nhow do you put together
an economic activity in which\nsome people are making pots,
other people are making spears,\nin which some people are
banking, and other\npeople are doing
something very\ndifferent-- medicine
or something like that.
The idea of synchronicity\nis that there
is no coordination\nbetween these activities
of a superordinate kind.
That is, they interact,\nbut there's not
an overarching principle that\nbinds them together into one
coherent form of activity.
And for Aristotle,\nthe notion was
that the cracks that open up\nbetween these uncoordinated,
but related and\ninteracting activities,
opens up the sphere of\neconomic opportunity.
So you know I started\nthinking about this.
This isn't just about\nthe Ancient Greeks.
That the way in which you get\nopening up a city economically,
is precisely by making\nthose interstices where
new things can be\ndeveloped, where
people can be entrepreneurial,\nrather than doing the kind of--
as the World Bank used to do--
I don't mean to pick\non them, as I worked
for them for a long time.
But as it used to do.
Which is to say\nthat what you wanted
was coherence in\neconomic planning.
That, for Aristotle,\nwas the death of a city.
For us, when we started\nthinking about--
Saskia particularly--\nabout economic activity
in modern cities in the\ndeveloping world today--
we have to call them emerging\ncities by the way, [inaudible]
is that how can we\nplan those ruptures?
That is, how do we create\nincoherences economically,
that allow those interstices\nwhich open people up?
And that goes back\nto the issue, Clay,
that you and I were working\non, which is informality.
But it's economic activity\nunderstood as informal
in the sense that\nit's synchronous,
which means that it's\nrelatively uncoordinated.
OK-- Oh God, I'm\ntalking too much.
The third aspect\nof an open city,
is that the open city should\nbe to the left of its nation
state.
In a way, this is perfectly\nand empirically obvious to all
of you in the United States,\nwhich is large cities that are
complex, and have\nmany elements are--
like New York and Boston--
much more to the left\nthan their nation states.
We mean this, I think, in a\nmore structural form, which is,
that the work of\nlegislating a nation state
is essentially the work in\nmost developing nation states,
of achieving closure on the\ninformality of the city.
That's the dynamic\nwe were playing with.
So the nation\nstate is, in a way,
it's principles of political\noperation-- constitutional,
as well as dictator centered--
are things that close down this\nself-revising process simply
by the formulation of laws that\napply to all the conditions
in the nation state.
So what we're really arguing\nis that every open city is not
so much socialist as\nanarcho-sydicalist.
That that's the opposition.
That's the left\nwe're interested in.
That it's out of necessity.
The more open it is, the more\nit escapes the nation states'
desire to create order.
I don't want to get lost in the\nrelationship between Catalonia
and Spain, but it's a\nperfect example of this.
OK well, these were then, some\nof the principles how we work.
We started backwards.
We started with values--
the scientific committee\nfor this year's Habitat III.
Those values are the\nvalues of open city.
It's founded on something\nthat's very fundamental, which
the idea of synoikismos.
The values are more Levinasian\nthan they are Buberian.
That technically\nthose values translate
into the ideas of\nan open system,
and that an open\nsystem, such as you
can see it in\ntechnical practice,
translates into a\ncity is an open system
via the principles of\ndialogicalism, synchronicity,
and anarcho-syndicalism.
That's where we were.
Now, I have to say that\nthere were several people who
took smelling salts\nwhen we presented this
at various points.
Now, I'm going to\nstart to just show you
some slides about what we\nwere thinking about this.
Hello.
Go.
There we are.
This is-- you have\nto forgive me--
I started photographing\non iPhone,
and I understand\njust whenever it
gets blown up, the\nlimits of using it.
This is Nehru Place\nin Delhi, and this
is the Silicon Valley of Delhi.
Beneath the platform\nover the ground
here is a parking garage.
The things you see on the\nside are startup centers--
little startup centers.
This is a place of lots\nand lots of different kinds
of activities happening\nat the same time.
Most of these are stolen goods\nthat people are selling here.
You know, iPhones that\ndropped off of a truck,
and things like that--
intermixed with real things\nlike saris and so on.
So it conforms to a\nkind of economic model.
But the most important\nthing about it to me,
as an urbanist looking\nat it, is the porosity
between the wall\nand the platform--
between the enclosed space\nand the open public space.
The people working in here,\nsome of them, they shop here.
Many of the people who are\nselling stolen goods here,
are receiving them here.
As an innovation\ncenter, Nehru Place
is stimulating to people because\nit's not just about innovators
living together in\na bubble, but it's
part of a very complex city.
This is in the southeast\npart of Nehru Place.
The reason we were here\nis we want to protect
this place against development.
And every developer in Delhi\nhas their eyes on this.
You know, get rid\nof all these people,
rip down this, and\nbuild a high-rise.
So the open principle here\nis that there's porosity
in function and in form, and\nthat the character of the space
is informal.
Just so you understand that this\nis not something, as it were,
Third World.
I hate that word.
Something similar operates\nin McDougle Street.
This is stuff going to\na lumber yard over here.
These are yuppie spaces\non McDougle Street,
and above them are old\nItalian tenements mixed in,
in this part of McDougle Street,\nwith light manufacturing.
So in my city, this\nis a kind of analog,
and the parts mix\nin with each other.
I talked about the\nrelationship of learning
that an open city takes skill.
And this is a slum in Dharavi.
It's again very mixed.
The reason I show\nit to you is this.
Over here is a school.
I don't know if any of you know\nanything about Indian trains.
But Indian trains\nare not what we
think of as the most\nreliable on time.
So the kids who\nlive here have got
to learn a kind of street\nsmarts about getting here,
and in a very basic\nway, listening hard
to the sound of a train\nthat may be there.
Sometimes, if they\ncan't escape the train,
they have to learn\nhow to hop onto it.
The trains are extremely noisy,\nso the lessons in the school
are geared to when the\ntrain doesn't wipe out
the voices of the\nteachers or pupils.
That's street smarts\nin an open environment.
And one of the things that\nimpressed me in Medellin--
where I also worked\nquite a lot--
is how sensorily adept\nkids are in dealing
with unforeseen or\nunchanging conditions here.
Much more so, I would hazard,\nthan kids in a Bourgeois state
in a city like\nLondon or New York.
They're constantly\nhaving to revise
the knowledge they have\nof an environment which
itself is very unstable.
This, unfortunately, has\nbeen at times the scene
of Muslim-Hindu conflict.
And sometimes quite violent.
And the children, again, have to\nlearn how to navigate around--
there are outbreaks of\nviolence all the time--
and the children have\nto learn to navigate
that kind of social\ndanger, just the way
they do physical danger.
So that's what I mean by--
and they get better\nand better at it--
a rolling kind of\ndialogical skill.
This is-- just so you\nsee it in Dharavi--
is another one of these\nterrible iPhone photos.
But what you see\nhere is the mixture
of, this is a production\nsite, food-selling site.
People live up here, and\nthey also work up here.
And this kind of gradation\nmeans that the space itself
is experienced as many things,\nrather than monofunctional.
And I should say about\nmonofunctional, spaces,
that's one of them in the back.
I'm really sorry\nabout my photograph.
It's only a space for residents.
This is funded by the\nIMF, this project.
It's housing.
It has flush toilets,\net cetera, et cetera.
It's decayed in about\nthe five or seven years
since it's been up.
Because, like a monoculture,\nonly one thing happens there.
People don't really take\nownership over it the way
they do about this space,\nwhich they have to make work,
because it's so complicated.
Whereas this space\nis just degraded.
The stairwells are\nfull of shit and piss.
People don't have a feeling\nthat they belong here in the way
that they do down here.
OK.
This is a kind of closed city.
Well there's a lot\nto say about this.
But the these spaces are\nimpermeable, as you can see,
and they're very repetitive.
And the reason I show\nyou this is that they're
derivative of this.
This is the most fundamental\nimage of modern planning
you need to know.
This is a proposal of Corbusier\nto destroy a complex fabric
in the Marais, and to replace\nit by a closed system, which is
boundaryless and homogeneous.
It's additive in\nClosed Systems Theory--
That the whole is not greater\nthan the sum of the parts.
And Corbusier-- this\nfrom 1925, wanted
to extend it over all\nthe Marais, and indeed
all of Paris.
The buildings themselves\nare quite beautiful.
So this is where I\ngrew up, right here.
This is Robert Taylor\nHomes in Chicago.
It was applied by\nliberal planning
as a way of housing\nmass numbers of people
in similar structures,\nwhich are relationless--
they are just\nadditive structures.
And this is another\nversion of the plan Voisin.
The shelves within the sheaths\nof all of these skyscrapers
in Tokyo are exactly the same.
And much of the skyscraper--\nthis is a photograph
of my friend Thomas Strood--
you look at it you\nthink this is diversity
in the urban environment.
In fact, it's exactly the\nidea of the plan Voisin,
but disguised.
And this, I would really\nsay, is the enemy of--
in thinking about\nan open city-- this
is the enemy of this, which\nis this kind of disguised
homogeneity.
And that was for us a\nvery practical thing.
I want to go faster.
We did a lot of work\non smart cities.
And here is another aspect\nof any closed system,
that there is a tight fit\nbetween form and function.
We looked at this in Masdar.
This is a docking station\ndesigned for the Masdar car.
And this was done by my\nfriend Bill Mitchell,
and Frank Gehry\ndesigned this car.
Unfortunately, after\nthey worked on this car,
others came along\nand improved it.
Which meant that\nthe cars no longer
fit in the docking stations,\nwhich have been torn down.
So this is also an issue\nabout open-ended design
in an open system,\nwhich is, that you avoid
a tight fit for\nform and function,
which is always a recipe for\ntechnological obsolescence.
Always.
Now, I'm going to speak\nto you very quickly
about what we tried--
Well, just let me say\nthat I'm so long-winded.
You know the\nfortunes of high tech
offer a key to understanding\nhow the city is closed.
High tech has moved from an\nopen to a closed condition.
Monopoly capitalism,\nrestriction of participation
in actually the formation of a\nprogram's open source, the menu
rather than the\nkernel dominates.
And that's true\nin cities as well.
There's a loss of synchronicity.
There's kind of standardization.
There's much less local\nexperiment economically,
and there is an erosion of\nthe powers of municipalities
at the hands of\nnation states, which
is a really big issue\nin the developing world.
I'm not going to talk about this\nbecause I've talked too much.
So I just wanted to end\nthis presentation by saying,
what can design do\nopen up the city?
That was our\npractical problematic.
I am not a design determinist.
I don't think that anything\nyou learn in this building
will change capitalism.
But that's the wrong\nway to think about it.
that The idea is,\nwhat if you could
get to the economic and\npolitical instruments
to contest Google\nand Microsoft, what
would you do in their place?
We were talking about\nthis last week in class.
If you believe that design\nis a kind of leading edge
against capitalism, basically--
well let's not get into it.
Anyhow.
But that's the idea.
What can design do about this?
We singled out three\nthings that you'll
see in these technical reports.
Edge conditions,\nincomplete form,
and arbitrary markings\nof value, is something
that design can do.
You know that in\nthe natural world
there's a distinction\non the edge condition,
between ecological borders\nand ecological boundaries.
Very important condition.
An ecological border is\nsomething where at the edge
there is more intense activity\nbetween different groups.
OK.
That's true of the way when\nthe shore hits the land.
That's where organisms feed.
It's where the speed of\nevolution is strongest.
Species, and so on.
This, which is drawn\nby one of my students--
and my favorite image\nin this whole thing--
are tiger boundaries\ndrawn in Asia.
And they represent-- you know\nhow a tiger makes a boundary
and poops, and it tells\nyou don't go across that.
And these are pretty\nrigid, and pretty solid
boundaries between the yellow,\nand the red, and so on.
But the notion is that at the\nboundary there's less activity.
So that's the two\nedge conditions.
One which the edge\nintensifies activity,
which is like a border,\nand the boundary in which
the edge condition dispels it.
Now, we're interested in\nmaking more borders and less
boundaries in the city.
And we're inspired by this,\nnot simply by the present day
conditions, but by the\nexample of Noli's map of Rome.
But if you look at the\nlittle things here,
they're all about\npermeable public spaces.
That's what all these\nlittle markings are.
This is not a figured ground.
This is a much more\nsophisticated map
in which Noli really tried\nto draw what is impermeable
and what is permeable.
St. Peter's as you know.
And we were interested,\nwere inspired
by this to look at this.
This is an urban\nboundary in Caracas.
We're trying to work at it.
You can see what the\nboundary is made of.
It's made of traffic.
The only way to cross from here\nto here is this one bridge.
Maids cross from here\nto clean these houses.
Nobody from this middle class\nthing crosses in to the barrio.
This was done under the sainted\nsocialist regime of Venezuela.
This one.
This is ubiquitous throughout\nthe emerging cities.
OK.
The second thing we\nwere interested in
was incomplete form.
You all know Aravena's Iquique,\nwhich is a form made incomplete
in order to be filled in.
The before and after.
And the idea of this--
which is rather persuasive,\nalthough I don't like
the actual architecture of it--
The idea of persuasiveness\nis it's better
to make half of a good house,\nthan to make a complete cruddy
house.
So these are economic\nand very good houses.
I adore him, but I have so\nmany problems about this.
Anyhow.
But that's the result. It's\nsweat equity, and it works.
We were interested in a\ndifferent condition, which
is incomplete form as something\nthat's found in the city,
rather than made from the start.
And the reason for\nthat is something
that you may not know if you\ndon't know Third World cities.
The spread in them\nis not built just
on empty agricultural land.
There are abandoned spaces\nthat are filled in for housing.
There are places which,\nas we see a lot in China,
in which there are\ndisused things--
like factories and so on--
which could be recolonized.
And the idea that\nthe development
occurs on a kind of blank\nslate is really wrong.
A lot of development\noccurs through colonizing
forms that were incomplete.
I worked on this project.
This has been always\na guide to me.
This is the Riverside Viaduct\nat 125th street in New York.
Do you know it?
Well, the West Side\nHighway is above it,
and this was originally just\nleft in the [? moses ?] era,
this was just left below this.
This is the west edge of Harlem.
And we put the first\nfairway supermarket.
We just inserted\nbelow the highway.
It was the first time\nthat blacks and whites
had a supermarket in West\nHarlem, and they met there.
And it was the kind\nof racial co-presence
which fit into the kind\nof social relations
I've been describing to you.
But the point about\nthis is everywhere
in cities there are\nplaces like this,
which are spaces which\nare incomplete forms which
are found.
And our argument\nin Habitat III is
that these are the spaces\nwe want to develop.
We want to do this\nkind of stuff,
rather than draw on\nblank sheets of paper.
And that's a big\nissue, I would say,
for people doing elements here.
The tendency is always\nto treat the city
as a kind of tabula rasa,\nwhich loses out exactly
on the possibilities for\ndoing this kind of stuff.
The third thing\nwe did is we were
very interested in the\nways of arbitrarily marking
spatial value--
to make a value where\nnobody saw value in space.
The prototype for this,\nthe classic way to do it,
is the Piazza del\nPopolo, and Sixtus V.
You use this obelisk as a\nway of saying, come here,
this is not just an empty space\nat the end of a bunch of roads,
it has a value.
The issue for us\nwas the relation
between context and non-context\nin ways of marking space.
This is a very\ncontext-specific marker.
The frame here\ndetermines the form
of these markers, which mark\nthis is a place of importance.
We were much more\ninterested in this--
in the use of arbitrary\nmarkers to make value
where there is no value.
This young boy is tending--
this is in Medellin, where\nI work a lot, as I said.
It's just he bought a\nplant and he planted it.
And it's a way of marking that\nspace as something other than--
it's blasted out because there's\nbeen a lot of drug violence
there.
I'm just saying,\nthis is habitable.
And what we have been thinking\nabout is ways of doing this.
I'm going to show you\nthe design issue of this.
This, in Berlin, is a\ncontext specific intervention
of a bench.
It can only be there\nbecause of the steps.
Where this is an\narbitrary imposition.
These benches are imposed\nto one of the most
degraded streets in East\nBerlin, and they make value.
One of the things that we have\nbeen thinking about in the work
we have been doing,\nparticularly in working
with decayed\nenvironments, is how
to create a system of these\narbitrary markers that
mark that this place\nmatters to someone.
These people have\nnever seen a bench.
I don't know if any of you\nknow, parts of East Berlin
are disgusting.
They are decaying.
People on the street.
You can see all of this.
But these very simple\nkind of interventions
are creating value for people.
And I have to say, it's part\nand parcel of an analytic level
of what happens\nin an open system,
that there are what are called\narbitrary intrusions which
change the path of development.
That's where you\nget task dependency
through what are called\narbitrary intrusions.
If you use the Linux system--
I can barely program\nit-- but if you're
good at programming in it,\nyou can introduce these
all the time.
This is the urban\nanalog to changing
the path of what something\nlooks like through an arbitrary
thing.
So this has translated.
We're spending a lot more money\nin both the IMF and World Bank,
on these things that are\nlooked at as gewgaws instead
of buildings, on\nstreet furniture,
on landscaping, on\nthings that arbitrarily
raise the value of places.
So I hope this gives you an\nidea of what I've been up to.
As I say, I don't think\nI'll live to Habitat IV.
Maybe I'll make to\n90, I don't know.
I doubt it.
But for us, these aren't all\nthat we're thinking about.
But these give you\nan eye flavor working
to open up edges as borders,\nto work with incomplete forms
as found opportunities,\nand to impose arbitrarily
value of transforming the city\nby design into an open system.
So that's what I have to say.
[applause]
[interposing voices]
Yeah, fine.
Open up for questions.
Tell me where we went wrong.
It's only 20 years of work, so.
Well, I'll start\nwith a question.
Yeah?
While you guys are getting\nyour questions together.
So I actually have two\nmaybe related questions.
First of all, thank\nyou very much.
I always love hearing you\ndraw on your great urban
sociological [inaudible]
Whatever.
--trying to understand how\npeople interact in spaces.
Your implicit, if not explicit,\ncritique of modernism,
in thinking about the open city.
So I guess, my first\nquestion has to do with--
I mean, the general\nquestion is, how would you
get citizens and the state--
and we can talk about\nthe local state now,
not even the\nnational government--
you made a point about the\nleft and the national state--
to value the open city\nthat you are producing.
Because I can see, in a roomful\nof designers, how we love what
you're talking about.
And the serendipity, and\nthe beauty of mixed use,
and spontaneity, and\nserendipity-- things you've
all written about.
But as somebody who works\nin the developing world,
you can imagine a conversation\nwith bureaucratic officials--
and even some middle-class\ncitizens-- who do not
appreciate the romanticization\nof informality,
for example, that\nyou've shown of Mumbai.
And that we may hate Corbusier\nand these big high-rises,
but a lot of people\nwant to live there,
and a lot of real\nestate developers
want to build those things,\nand a lot of local governments
are looking for mass-produced\nhousing for their citizens.
So just let me add that I'm\nworking with students here.
I've done some work in Mexico.
We're in a city in [inaudible],,\nI hope some of you are here.
Oh, really?
But you get citizens that want\nto have single-family homes out
in the middle of nowhere.
They don't want\nto be interacting
in places that look like\nMumbai and Dharavi, et cetera.
So how do we take\nthese wonderful ideas
that you're talking about, that\nwe as designers and planners
might be thinking about, and\nhow do we promote and change
the way people have come\nto think about cities now?
Well, that's a\nwonderful question.
One of the volumes in\nthe report of Habitat III
is about co-production.
And our answer to getting people\ninvolved in working this way,
is by a whole set-- and\nit's in my new book.
It's so cheap and it'll come\nout April 11th you guys.
It has a lot about co-production\nas a way of involving people
in the process of wanting to\nmake places more open rather
than closed.
I'm going to just give\nyou one example of this
that we've been working on.
Co-production is not the\nsame as consultation.
Consultation is an expert\ngetting up and saying,
this is what you should do.
Isn't it beautiful?
And the people say, no,\nthat's not what I want.
We've worked with all\nsorts of techniques
where skilled designers like\nme and ordinary citizens,
work on actually generating\nalternative forms
for a particular project.
Some of it may seem\ntrivial to you.
The use of big-scaled\nStyrofoam blocks,
which people can move\naround and experiment with,
is really involving to people.
We've got a whole\nset of techniques.
We've made catalogs\nof parts that would
put Rem Koolhaas to shame.
That people sort of\nflip through there.
Their coffee table objects,\nand Rio, and so on.
But the point about this--\nmy experience with this
is that the more you involve\nexpert and citizens together
from the beginning\nin co-production,
the more people are\nopen to being open,
and the less what\nthey want to do
is build a gated-community,\nbecause they're
involved in the design\nprocess from the beginning.
The one limit on all of this--
and again this is\njust my own experience
in working with\npoor communities--
at a certain point\nthe expert disappears.
If you make three or four--
just the same thing\nwe do in the GSD--
you make three or four\nalternatives of a project,
people can look at it.
They understand the pluses\nand minuses of each.
And then the so-called experts\nsays goodbye and the people
themselves have to decide\nwhat they want to do.
When I worked in Beirut\nin the mid and late '90s
on reconstruction\nof a part of Beirut,
with that horrible\nterrorist Hezbollah.
Let's not go there.
And between Hezbollah and\na lot of the phalanges,
parts of South\nBeirut were a mess.
But if you laid out to\npeople three or four ways--
worked with them-- ways of\neven using a scarce resource
like copper wire.
And you've got to decide.
In conditions like that,\npeople say well they're gone.
I claimed my mother had gotten\nill, or something like that.
I had some excuse.
And these two groups--
they hated each other,\nbut they worked together
to come to a decision.
But much more\nbroadly, I just think
that the answer to\nopening the city it's
more democracy of design.
Not a better design.
Do you understand\nwhat I'm saying?
It's not the right design that\ninvolves people in the city.
It's the notion that they\nmade whatever is there.
Even if it's so simple\nas distributing copper
tubing for plumbing.
So you're calling for\na participatory design,
which I think we're\ntrying to do more here.
I'm not going to\nstart a dialogue here.
And I totally agree with you.
But then we start\nthinking about,
what are the\ninstitutions that are
available to us to suggest--
and the scale at\nwhich that happens.
I guess I'm agreeing\nwith you in saying
that we need to\nbe working more on
not just being\ncompelled by the idea,
but how do we implement\nit in practice.
This is a part of the\ndilemma that we're constantly
facing in planning\nand design, which
is how you get the designers to\ntake processes and repertoires
of action that are in planning?
It's not just that we can't\nagree that that's important,
but then how do you change\nlarger planning institutions
at the scale of a city to\nengage participatory design.
Breakdown, yeah.
We should have some\nquestions here though.
Hi.
Thank you for your\nwonderful talk.
I had the opportunity to work\nwith one of the communities
that you chose.
Oh, great.
Which one?
Caracas.
It was the barrio.
It was the informal settlements.
Oh, Caracas.
And in a process of\nparticipatory design,
at that opportunity I\nhad read your theory
about borders and boundaries.
I really wanted to\nimprove more connection
between different communities.
Because, as you know,\nthese informal settlements
is not only one community.
Yeah, it is many.
Is the sum of many\nsmaller communities.
But at the same time, they\nlive the good experience
of interaction, the\ncommunity suffer the problems
of lack of rules, of\nnorms, to work together,
to live together.
So in that opportunity\nI proposed many options.
And the community to choose the\nones that promote an enclaves.
That's just the\nway it should be.
They walled in the\ncommunity, because they
want to protect themselves\nfrom the violence
of the environment.
So how can we deal if we know\nof technicians, that committee
is choosing what we think is\nnot a good option for them?
Well, in that community--
that's a very drug--
Am I remembering that right?
No, it's not.
I think that's\nsomething about talk.
That's where this\ndialogical thing comes in.
The more you can get people\nto talk with each other--
but that's just my own\nexperience with it.
If you say, what do\nyou want to people,
they'll say safety, protection,\nlock the doors, and so on.
If you get people from different\ncommunities talk to each other,
the process can open up.
And oftentimes talk\nis not goal-oriented.
That's where the informality\nof this comes in.
This is not a magic bullet--
open city.
I said that in the beginning.
I just emphasize that.
But it is a way of thinking\nabout how you want to guide
the kind of action you have.
If you don't want\npeople to close up,
you have to get them to interact\nin ways where they're not
focused on the\nother as a threat.
Do you know what it mean?
And that's dialogical.
It's non-aggressive,\nnon-assertive ways of thinking.
As I remember, that's from\nvillages all over Venezuela,
isn't it, that barrio?
[inaudible]
Yeah.
Anyhow.
Hello.
Over here.
I don't see you.
Raise your hand.
Down on the first row.
Oh, there you are.
Yes.
Thanks for your lecture.
I was wondering.
You mentioned how design\ncan't change capitalism,
but I'm wondering how design can\ndismantle it, or transform it.
Isn't that the same thing?
Well, no.
Because it is saying,\nwe're not changing
the principles of capitalism.
We're not changing how it works.
We're actually just\nusing a different system.
You could do that, but it\nwould be on a very small scale.
I'm giving you serious\nanswer to this.
I think the notion\nthat you create
a protected realm\nwhere you're working
with a different set of\nassumptions, can be valuable.
But you're never going to\nachieve scale that way.
Politics requires politics.
I don't think design,\nfor instance--
if I wanted to stop\ngentrification in New York,
I know exactly what I do.
I'd Institute commercial\nrent controls.
It would work a treat.
But it has nothing to do\nwith what any of those stores
look like.
It's economic power,\nagainst economic power.
And I just think for\nyou, as a designer,
if you think, how can I avoid\nthis system by making a better
design?
It's too small, and it's\ntoo, in a way, unreal.
I mean, what we do as\ndesigners it's very partial,
it's very important.
It's very important to\nthink what should be.
But the power of what\nshould be is limited.
You understand the\npoint I'm making.
You've got to fight\ncapitalism with socialism.
Period.
You're not going to fight it\nwith lowering the building
heights.
Do you know what I mean?
There is a kind of\nway in which you
have to enter into the\nadult world of dirty power,
and recognize that\nyou're partially
going to be imprisoned by\nthat, and demeaned by it.
But not simply to\nthink that, oh, it's
useless to do anything by that.
Now, I don't know.
I suffered this all my life.
I'm a good socialist.
But it's in a somewhat\ndifferent compartment from me,
from my eye
[inaudible] -- the way that we\ndesign involves the economic
systems and the political\nsystems in place.
So inherently, all design\nis political in that way.
Absolutely.
So I guess I'm wondering like--
What I'm talking about is\nthe power of what you make.
You can get a vision of\nsomething that's different.
But as I say, the vision of\nsomething that's different
is not going to be\nempowering in a way
that political or economic\nactivity is empowering.
This is just my\nown view of this.
And I'll tell you\nwhy I feel this.
Because so often-- it's a\ndiscussion I had with Jane
Jacobs all the time--
so often we were fighting\npower and we lose, we give up,
because the things we want to\nbuild are just overwhelmed.
And just to say about her--
I mean the thing about\nJane is, after she
wrote Economy of\nCities, she sort
of lost interest in design.
Because she saw it\nwasn't going to change--
She could resist Robert Moses,\nbut she couldn't erase him.
And she became\nuninterested in urbanism.
She had wonderful,\nwonderful writings,
but it was a kind of defeatism.
I don't think that's the\ntrajectory you want to go in.
Can I get in here for a second?
And then we have somebody\nhere had a hand up also--
We have one up in\nthe balcony, too.
OK.
Yeah, great.
OK.
I just want to respond to\nthis exchange a little bit.
And maybe add what I thought\nyou were going to say,
Richard, about the issue\nabout design and capitalism.
I'm going to sit for--
In total agreement that the\nbuilding heights and how you--
thinking in a very narrow\nsense of physical design,
obviously, is not going\nto dismantle capitalism.
But that doesn't\nnecessarily mean
that one has to say that all\ndesign reinforces capitalism,
right?
And I think what's missing\nin that conversation is
the focus on the fact that\nto dismantle capitalism is
a social and political project,\nas Richard has said-- social
as well as a political\nproject, which
means people have to be involved\nand they have to mobilize
and they have to do the work\nof fighting against capitalism.
And this is where I think\nthe design comes in.
It's quite consistent\nof what you
were saying about open cities.
How do you create cities\nthat bring people together
to mobilize?
So there is a design\ndimension to it.
But there's not a direct\nrelationship with design
and the dismantling\nof capitalism.
Is how did design create\nthe urban conditions,
the solidarity, the\nsense of values,
the conversation, the\nnormative project,
that would be necessary in order\nto fight against capitalism so
I don't think get out of\nthe picture completely,
but it's really important not\njust to any direct relationship
between design and support for\nor dismantling of capitalism.
I couldn't have said\nit better myself.
Should I go?
OK.
Hi, thank you here.
First I want to say, I\nam actually from Beijing.
And it's actually quite sad\nevery time people mention
about a Chinese\ncity, they always
show those pictures of\nhigh-rise, gated, tower
community.
Where I actually want to say,\nI think, in Chinese culture,
if you look at the ground level,\nsometimes you built very--
as you would put it-- very\nenclosed closed urban space.
But people somehow\nalways try to find a way
to permeate that\nclosed structure,
and then figure out a way to--
on the ground level-- to\ninteract with each other.
And as you were showing all\nthese wonderful examples,
I was just wondering, out\nof all these countries
you've worked with,\ndo you find this idea
of creating a more open\ncity a universal concept
that should be adopted\nby every culture?
Or is there some exceptions that\nyou've met, where people do not
want this kind of open space?
And as planners,\nI guess it's also
should we prioritize this\nas our idea of planning?
Or should we--\nsometimes there are
ideas that we always promote,\nlike DOT and Shared Bike,
and all that.
But sometimes that's not the\ncommunity's top priority.
Right?
It's like these little wonderful\ndesigns on a street level
to create a more open space.
How much should we as\nplanners prioritize these?
Well, you made a comment\nand asked me a question.
The comment, is you're\nabsolutely right.
I mean, those\nbuildings can be used
by people who want to\nhave life on the ground.
UNDP is involved in trying to\nsalve as many of the hutong
structures in\nBeijing as we can--
also the shikomen in Shanghai--
as structures as\nplaces for people
to practice that kind of life.
I'd say it's just harder\nwhen you're dealing
with a 46-story building.
It's just harder to hold on to.
The question you\nasked me, I'm going
to answer in a way which\nmay seem outrageous.
I think you should universalize\nevery value you have.
I don't think you should\nbe culture-specific.
Let people argue\nwith you and say,
but that doesn't work here.
We don't want that.
Don't be nice.
Oh, I understand\nyour way of life.
You want to live in\na gated-community,
and never see a black person.
I understand.
You're southern American.
I sympathize.
No.
Not at all.
And I think part of the whole\njob of planning is to say,
this is what you should want.
Argue with people.
Be dialogical with them\nrather than substitute empathy
for will.
That's my own view of this.
And I have to say, I\nmean, I'm as a nice guy,
but I practice what I preach.
When you say to people,\nyou're all wrong.
You want the wrong things.
They take that more seriously\nthan if you say, oh, God,
poor you.
This is true.
It's an experience\nin this country
with white, working class,\npeople for instance.
If you go, oh,\nthey're such victims.
They're suffering.
I understand why\nthey voted for Trump.
No.
No, the answer is to say,\nyou did something wrong.
And that is a way of taking\nthe other person seriously
as a person.
So I just don't buy this\nnotion of communal sensitivity.
I don't buy it at all.
I think you should\nbe a provocateur.
Well, it's really terrific\nto hear somebody actually
say something firm.
So I was formulating a moment\nago a rather rough question.
But I wanted to precedent\nit with a rather sentimental
anecdote, which is, the\n125th Street exit off
of the West Hudson Parkway.
Every time I come in to New\nYork to visit a friend of mine
in Harlem, that Safeway\nis an amazing indicator
that I am now in a city.
Oh, my boy!
[laughs]
So very, very happy to see it.
So now for the more\ndifficult question.
You obliquely\nactually-- or actually
even directly\nconfronted this-- but
that the procedures and\nprocesses of designs, I think,
work in so far as\nthe powerbrokers,
more specifically,\nthe actors that
have agency in this\nsituation, really
even want to entertain\nthe conversation.
And I think that in a\nneighborhood like Caracas,
you have this density\nand overlaying of people,
that you almost kind of have a\nmilieu where you can at least
have publicity of your cause.
But in, let's say, these white\nworking class neighborhoods
in the United States-- or\nI'd say, more specifically,
in the underserved neighborhoods\nof the caricatured inner cities
of the United States,\nthe powerbrokers who
would have the ability\nto reshape and provide
the services, or to provide\nthe resources to enable
those communities, are\nabsent, disengaged,
and absolutely not looking\nto entertain big city liberal
coming in to save the day.
So I'm absolutely with you\non the design strategy front.
And I'm absolutely with\nyou on the argument
that politics is the situation.
But how do you actually\nengage to make audience
the issues of what\nyou're describing,
especially contextual to\nthe United States I think?
Well, that's a\nreally good question.
I'll just give you a couple\nanswers I've found about this.
One of the things\nthat I've recommended
when I've done\ncommunity organizing,
is that people not go to\ncommunity consultations,
that they don't play the\ngame of listening to somebody
tell them what's going\nto be done for them.
And this is a strategy\nnot unique to me--
it comes from Saul Alinsky--
about the notion of what\npower needs is an audience.
And if their audience\nis absent, there's
a lot of delegitimization.
That goes on.
So when we were working in\nChicago on Cabrini-Green,
the notion was that we boycotted\nthe official workings of this.
You need somebody\nfrom the outside
who is going to be an\nalternative source of power
often.
And working with emerging\ncities, that's a role that UNDP
and now UN-Habitat\nare trying play.
They are, as it were,\nat the local level--
that alternative to voice to\nthis articulation of power.
It's a really\ncomplicated issue for us,
because the UN is caught in\nall these cross currents.
But what I know about this is\nthat the way to start with this
is by delegitimating\nthe settings
and institutions in which\npower gets itself ratified.
And that means a totally\ndifferent relationship
to a thing like planning boards.
When we were working\non Dharavi, we
were encouraging people to\nvote en [? blanco. ?] You
know that is?
To turn in blank ballots to\nsay that the process is not
legitimate.
It's a whole different\nset of tools.
Is it successful?
Sometimes.
And sometimes it isn't.
But it is at least understanding\nthat the point of this
is to start by delegitimating\nthe process by which power
ratifiers itself through all\nthese planning instruments.
And do you all know the\nname of Saul Alinsky?
Is somebody familiar to you all?
[inaudible]
Citizens Action program.
Back of the Yards program.
He was once here, by the way,\nand stayed for 20 minutes.
And just said,\nit's not worth it.
Well, that's the old GSD.
That's the old GSD.
Absolutely.
We have one more--
Yeah, we have one more\nquestion, and then I--
Yeah.
Thank you.
I wanted to extend a\nlittle bit the point
that Diane brought up, about\ninstitutions who could champion
and advocate for the things\nyou're talking about--
the exchange, the serendipity,\nthe unplanned encounter,
and good things that happen\nin open urban environments.
If we think about the actual\npractice of real estate
development, urban\ndesign, and architecture,
then the owners of properties\nbehind private property lines
have very clear motives to--
whether it's profit-driven\nmotives of other
self-interested motives--
in championing their cause.
The public space,\non the other hand,
is generally owned by the\npublic or by the municipality.
I should be, yeah.
It should be.
Right.
And they oftentimes\ndon't have the same level
of advocacy or\ninterest in advocating
for the things you talk about.
And if you simply\nthink to look into,
for instance, urban\ndesign practice,
all urban designers\nknow that there's
very little money\nin urban design--
all the money is\nin the buildings.
After doing the urban\ndesign, the hope to get
commissioned a few buildings out\nof it to pay the bill that went
[inaudible].
So I guess my question is,\nhave you encountered, or do you
have institutions and cities as\nexamples, where that has been
managed and figured out in\nbetter ways, in which you can
really put resources\nbehind the management
and design of public space in\na very serious way to champion
the values you're talking about.
Examples like-- just\nwhat comes to mind,
for instance, Vienna has a\nplanning department composed
of 300 people for\nthe size of Vienna,
and it does a really great work.
But what sort of examples--
I'll give you one example\nthat we're working--
the mayor of Bogota,\nEnrique Penalosa--
has he ever spoken here?
Yeah, he has.
He's also part of this\nscientific community.
He has pointed out that\nthe greatest privatization
of public space is\nparking, and the strategies
in his paper for taking back\nthe public and public space
is largely to shrink streets\nand eliminate street parking.
Very banal in a way.
But also very, very profound,\nwhich is the notion that we
have to-- and I am\nconvinced by him on this--
rethink the notion\nof motion in the city
in order to take back\nthis public space.
And that goes back in the\nhistory of urbanism to
[? hausmann, ?] who\nwas against parking,
and what happened with\nthe automobile, and so on.
The larger question-- and\nthat is an example of trying.
He's trying to do it.
And he's been very successful\nin Bogota, his first two
times around as mayor, and\nin recapturing public space.
There is another issue--
we just don't have\ntime to talk about it--
which is that there are two\nways in which people invest.
Foreign investors invest\nin cities at a distance.
One is opportunity\ninvesting, where
you're focused on a\nmissed opportunity,
or lack of money to\ndevelop a particular site.
And the other is\ncore of investing,
which is where you're basically\nbuying specifications.
Materials and so on.
And then you're\nbuilding a building
to suit in some place it's\ncompletely non context
dependent.
And what's happening in the\neconomy of a lot of developing
cities, is there is this shift\nfrom opportunity investing--
which requires local\nknowledge-- to core investing,
in which the process\nof development
is like a voluntary\nexchange based on specs.
So one of our recommendations is\nthat core investors, if they're
going to do that,\nbe required to see
a building through to\nits actual completion.
Because a lot of core\ninvesting then flips.
I buy a project, then I\nsell it on to somebody,
or sell a right.
Something like that.
That's a way of at least\nholding private capital
responsible for\ndelivering something.
It's minimal.
But it is a halfway step.
And some countries will do this.
I think Great\nBritain is actually
going to do this,\nin which you hold
an investor responsible to\nthe public for actually trying
to make a profit out of a\npublic good, which is land.
Anyhow, this has been an\nincredibly long discussion.
Thank you for being so patient.
And before you end tonight.
Before we give you a huge\nround of applause to you.
Because I am so happy, you\ngave this lecture, Richard,
because this is a very rich\nconversation that I hope
we can continue-- is this on?
No.
No.
--that we can continue\nhere at the school.
But I just want to pull\nup some summary points,
and then we're going to have a\nhuge round of applause for you.
One, again, just picking\nup on your last comment.
I just think that--
this is a super\nself-serving comment,
but I just think that what we're\nstarting to talk about here,
is the way in which design\nand planning are all
about politics and power.
And how do you make decisions\nabout how do you engage
with that larger project?
It's so easy to think about\nthe discipline of planning,
the discipline of urban design\nis if they float around.
They float around.
And that it's\nreally about if you
want to change the physical and\nsocial world in which we live
in, for other\nobjectives, it's really
about engaging\nthose institutions
and being strategic\nin those arrangements.
The second comment that I'd\nlike to pull up, that I think
came through in your answers\nto multiple questions,
and I'm actually even thinking\nabout the fellow upstairs
with like the United States.
I think that one thing that I\nlearned being in the planning
side of our department\nfrom urban designers,
is the importance of\nthinking strategically
about where to intervene.
And you brought it up with\nthe kind of liminal space
that you're looking at.
But we could take\nthat framework,
not just in different places,\nto be exploring and discovering
different places in a\nneighborhood, or in a city,
for intervention.
That might have the greatest\ncapacity to kind of shake up
things.
But we should be thinking\nabout cities that way.
In particular, we\nas students here,
should be honing our\nanalytical skills
to understand the\ncharacter and the nature,
physical and social, of\ndifferent types of cities.
Large cities versus\nsmall cities.
Southern cities of Trump\nvoters versus New York City.
And that in some ways you can\nbe strategic about intervening
in those places, in creating\nprojects in those places,
that will change the\nsocial conversation.
And that's what's\ngoing to work up.
We tend to focus our\nattention, maybe,
on the skills that we're\ngetting-- the design
skills and the planning skills.
Process and building design.
But we're not thinking\nabout the places
that we should be applying\nthose projects more.
If you care about changing\npolitics, or dismantling
capitalism, that's\nthe analytic you need.
Not just the skill set itself.
And I guess it's a call\nout for focusing more
on the specificity of places.
Knowing the deep\nculture, history,
institutions of places,\nmany different places,
and then being\nstrategic about where
you want to apply your skills.
Rather than just always--\neverybody's always
working in New York City.
Everybody's always\nworking in the places that
are most close to the project\nthat we're trying to achieve,
as opposed to going\nto the tough places
to be urban planners\nand designers.
And I just think all that came\nthrough in both in your talk,
and in the engagement\nwith the students.
So thank you so much, Richard.
Well, thank you for asking me.
[applause]
