Hello.
Good evening and welcome.
I'm Eve Blau.
I'm the co-director of\nthe Harvard Mellon Urban
Initiative, which is the\nsponsor for this event.
And I'm very pleased\nto welcome you
to tonight's lecture and panel\ndiscussion and conversation.
This is the culminating\nevent, as many of you
probably know, in a three-part\nseries of interventions
and workshops that\nhave been taking place
over the last couple of\ndays, yesterday and today.
On Wednesday morning, there was\na workshop called Intervening.
And some of the speakers tonight\nwere part of that workshop.
And earlier today,\nthere was another.
It was called a\nTalkshop on Agendas,
which was also with\nrepresentatives from Assemble,
and actually, most of the\nspeakers tonight and Stephen
Zacks and Sandra Branch\nof the Flint Art Project
in Flint, Michigan.
So this program as a whole,\nthis series of events
is intended to offer\nstudents and other people who
are participating hands-on\nengagement with methods
of intervention and critical\ndebates about the agency,
or how the agency to\ntransform the public realm
can be and is seized by artists\nand architects and curators
and critics and various\npublic sector actors.
Now, before I introduce\nStephen Zacks,
who is going to moderate\ntonight's conversation,
I just want to say a few\nwords about the initiative
as a whole, the\nMellon Initiative.
It is a cross-Harvard\nproject, which
means it crosses the\nvarious schools at Harvard.
It's funded by a four-year grant\nfrom the Mellon Foundation.
And that grant and\nthe project itself
are directed towards\nexploring interdisciplinary
and multimedia methods for\nstudying urban environments,
societies, and cultures across\nthe design disciplines, so all
of the disciplines that are\nhere, but also the humanities
and the social sciences.
And the idea in all\nof this is that,
with a common object of study--
the city-- we can\nbegin to bridge
these disciplinary boundaries\nand learn from each other
and have conversations\nthat are really fruitful.
So for the last\nthree years, we've
been carrying out research\nand site visits, site travel,
with faculty and students\nfrom different schools
across the university.
And we've been focusing\nthat work on four cities,
on Berlin, Boston,\nIstanbul, and Mumbai,
which we see as portals\ninto specific geographies
and urban issues.
They're very different cities\nin very different parts
of the world.
And through that research,\nactually, and the conversations
between these portals,\nwe have been opening up
a very interesting,\nactually, and quite broad
field of comparative\nresearch across geographies
and cultures.
So this is our fourth\nyear of the project.
And our focus has shifted from\nsite-based research and travel
to public programming.
We've had an extensive series\nof conferences and colloquia
and workshops and\npanel discussions
across the year, most of it,\nactually, in this semester.
And in those events, we've\ntried to address major themes
that have emerged in the\ncourse of our research
and our work in the portals,\nbut that also extend quite a bit
the discussions beyond\nthe portal research.
And this is one of\nthose events that
really moves quite far\nbeyond the research
that we've been doing and\nvery specifically grounded,
actually, here.
And so before I\nintroduce Stephen,
I want to thank the Mellon\nFoundation and the Graduate
School of Design,\nespecially Dean Mostafavi,
and also Associate Dean and\nInterim Chair of Architecture,
Michael Hays, who has been\nsupporting this program.
And I want to thank the\norganizers, actually,
of these events--
Eric [? Ganoyu, ?] who is\nour program manager, who
has masterminded all of these\nthings, Michael Haggerty, who's
been working with him\nfor about a year on this,
and Ken Stewart,\nwho has also been
working with us in the last\nlittle while on this project.
The structure for the evening,\nNato Thompson will present.
Then his presentation\nis going to be followed
by a response from\nPaloma Strelitz
and Anthony Engi\nMeacock of Assemble.
And then it's going to end with\na conversation between Thompson
and Assemble that will be\nmoderated by Stephen Zacks.
Well, I had left out--
I'm terribly sorry.
Sandra Branch is\npart of that too.
OK, Stephen Zacks is a\ndistinguished architecture
and urban journalist,\ntheorist, and cultural producer
who's based in\nGreenpoint, Brooklyn,
and is a native of\nFlint, Michigan.
He received an MA\nin liberal studies
from the New School for\nSocial Research and BA
in interdisciplinary humanities\nfrom Michigan State University.
He served as an editor\nat Metropolis Magazine.
And he's received\na number of awards
from various institutions,\nincluding the Warhol
Foundation, Creative\nCapital, ArtPlace, the Graham
Foundation, the\nNational Endowment
for the Arts, the MacDowell\nColony, and the New York State
Council on the Arts, and\nthe Newtown Creek Fund.
He is also the founder\nand creative director
of the Flint Public\nArt Project, which
organizes public\nevents and workshops
and temporary installations to\ninspire residents to re-imagine
the city, to reclaim vacant\nand underutilized buildings
and lots, and to use\ninnovative tools to steer
Flint's long-range planning.
Please join me in\nwelcoming Stephen Zacks.
[APPLAUSE]
Thanks for the\nkind introduction.
So as Eve said, I'm\na journalist covering
public art, architecture,\nand urbanism for Metropolis,
currently Architect's Newspaper,\nand an organizer of projects
meant to impact\nthe public realm.
And I'm excited to welcome Nato\nThompson to discuss public art
and urban engagement as a\npart of the Mellon Urbanism
Initiative.
Curator and now artistic\ndirector of Creative Time
since 2007, Nato has\nplayed a formative role
in shaping the\nfield of public art
and its engagement with the\ncity through his annual Creative
Time Summit and projects like\nPedro Reyes\' "Doomacracy,"
Kara Walker\'s, "A Subtlety"\nin the former Domino Sugar
factory, "Living as Form" a\nsurvey of socially engaged art,
questioning the boundary between\nart and socio-political action.
Trevor Paglen\'s\n"The Last Picture,"
which deployed a record of human\ncivilization sent into orbit,
and Paul Chan\'s "Waiting for\nGodot in New Orleans," which
was an outdoor\nstaging of Beckett
as a testimony to the\ngovernment's failed
response to Hurricane Katrina.
He's brought a new\norder of criticality
to art that happens in\npublic places, which
can be seen as answering\nRosalyn Deutsche's
call for a public\nart that facilitates
the expression of\nsocial groups excluded
from the current\norganization of the city
and help appropriate the city\nas a vehicle for illuminating
contradictions.
Previously, Nato worked\nas a curator at Mass MOCA,
where he curated The\nInterventionists,
Art in the Social\nSphere in 2004,
which helped articulate\nthe intervention
as a defined\ntypology of practice.
And apart from his\nrole as curator,
Nato has been an important voice\nin the field whose writings
have appeared in book form,\nfrieze, art form, third text,
and Huffington Post.
And moreover, he has\nauthored two books--
Seeing Power, Art and\nActivism in the 21st
Century, and most recently,\nCulture as Weapon,
the Art of Influence\nin Everyday Life, which
brings insight and urgency to\nthe question of how culture
serves as a tool of\npropaganda and liberation
in our political moment.
So please welcome Nato Thompson.
[APPLAUSE]
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming out.
I know you students\ngot homework to do.
So yeah, I wrote a book.
Just for all of\nyou younger people,
I want you to know that\nif you write a book,
you will make no money.
But it feels good.
And feeling good is\na good part of life.
And you could kind\nof feel fancy.
So this is the book,\nCulture as Weapon.
I want to talk\nabout it because--
I'm going to give\ntwo parts of my talk.
There's going to be two parts.
You've just got to bear\nwith me because it's
going to feel somewhat\nschizophrenic,
but we'll try to be\ndelicate about it.
The first part, I want to go\non what this book is about,
which this book is\nin some ways trying
to talk about\npublic art, perhaps,
or culture-making in the\ncity, but not made by artists.
So we'll get into it.
But that's the first part.
And then the second\npart is I also
just want to talk about some\npublic art projects I've
done, to just get into the\nkind of practice of public art,
if that's OK.
And then we'll have\nsome discussions.
Good.
And I work at a place\ncalled Creative Time.
That's our brand.
Since we don't have an\narchitectural facility,
we are like a\nguerrilla organization
that does public art\nprojects throughout New
York and sometimes the US.
And we're starting to\nthink about doing work
internationally.
But when you don't\nhave an actual house
that you call your own, your\nbrand becomes your house.
All right, that's our brand.
All right, so I want to start\nwith something very unorthodox.
Let's get it.
Where is it?
Where are you?
OK, there we are.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- NATO Forward Operating\nBase, Morales-Frazier.
The outpost of US Marines\nand French paratroopers
is surrounded by Taliban forces.
[HELICOPTER WHIRRING]
- If you all could stand\nover there, please.
- John Green is preparing\na military mission
with an unusual objective.
- Stand over there\nfor now, please.
- He and Dr. Matt\nArnold are part
of a group of civilian social\nscientists called The Human
Terrain Team, a key to\nturn the people here away
from the Taliban.
- Uh, Richard's gonna\nride into the lab.
The cameraman, we're\ngoing to put in the bab.
And you're going to want to be--
- For the next 18\nhours, our crew
will embed with\nthem as they head
outside the secure perimeter\ninto the front lines
of the conflict.
- The valley's gonna\nbe on the left.
We want the gun on the left.
We want you on back side.
Hey, y'all be careful.
We'll see you out there.
- Roger.
- The chances that\nthe Taliban will
attempt to strike\nthis mission are high.
They likely know Matt\nand John's destination,
a highly publicized\ntown meeting.
The helicopter gunship sweeps\nthe route ahead of the convoy,
looking for signs of\ninsurgent activity.
On the ground, safely moving the\nfour-person Human Terrain Team
requires 30 armed soldiers\nand seven armored vehicles.
But the mission is critical.
As part of an effort to win\nthe hearts and minds here,
the US funded the\nbuilding of a paved road.
But the plan has backfired.
Road construction\nhas bulldozed homes.
Villages are now threatening\nto join the Taliban.
The team must\nsomehow make amends.
[END PLAYBACK]
[LAUGHS]
Sorry, it's not funny.
But it's like, but\nsomething went wrong.
They built a road and plowed\nthrough people's homes.
That did not endear them.
So this is--
Wouldn't you want that\nvoice narrating your wake-up
in the morning?
I don't know when National\nGeographic got that style.
It was A while ago.
So this is a doc around a\nsystem called the Human Terrain
System, which is, in fact--
one of my chapters in the book\ngoes into this quite deeply.
It\'s called "The Insurgents."
But it talks about the\nmoment during the Iraq War
where it moved from--
Donald Rumsfeld's\nWar of Shock and Awe
was its adage to\nHearts and Minds.
And Hearts and Minds\nwas the brainchild
of Petraeus, who came in.
And Hearts and Minds was a\nmodel of fighting warfare
that borrowed its entire\ntoolkit from a large trove
of information from\ncounterinsurgency models,
pulling particularly from the\nFrench occupation of Algeria
to the insurgency of Mao Zedong.
And what's interesting\nabout it-- and you're like,
we're talking about public art.
Why are we dealing with\nthe Human Terrain System
in Iraq and Afghanistan--
is because when Petraeus\ncame into the military, what
was fascinating to\nme was they called it
the cultural turn\nin the military,
which certainly\npricked my ears up.
And when I started looking\nat the methods they used,
which was-- just to\nsay, Petraeus was
a big advocate of what we need\nto do when we go into Mosul,
for example, is we need to\nbuild roads, build schools, hold
tribal council meetings,\nget to know people.
Those soldiers need to\nget out of their tanks
and walk the beat and get to\nbecome a face in the community.
And when I was looking\nat these methodologies,
it occurred to me that\nit looked strikingly
similar to the same\nkind of tactics
I was invested in\nwith public art.
And so this book is\na kind of opportunity
to look at methodologies\nof sociality
across a wide variety\nof discourses.
So in this particular\nchapter, I get
into the military and the\nways in which the Hearts
and Minds approach,\nor the cultural turn,
I look at that and its methods.
And part of it hints at a\ncertain kind of reflection
back onto art itself.
There are some other\nchapters, one of them
which I called "The Real\nEstate Show"-- and certainly,
it will be germane to\nour conversation today.
And I'm sure most\nof you in this room
know more about the\nsubject than I do.
But it's looking at\nthe last 20 years
of the growth of\nthe phraseologies
of the creative city,\nthe creative class,
that terrifyingly creepy\nword called the creative,
and the other friendly word\nof it that is also creepy,
the innovation.
I don't know if you guys\nuse those words here.
They just sound like a\ngross Ted Talk thing.
But you know, the world\nwhere capitalism has entirely
embraced the language\nof creativity.
And now, we have a\nworld where everyone
is encouraging everyone to\nbe creative at all times.
The arts, profoundly,\nhas left the arts,
and has become a kind of\nlogic of urbanism itself.
So with that in mind, I will\nalso turn to the public art
projects.
But I'm looking for\na certain kind of--
I guess one of the things\nI want to think about
as I talk about my\npublic art projects is--
not mine, but to be fair,\npublic art is a team sport.
It takes a lot of people.
It's a village kind of style.
But to think about the\ncomplexities of the forces that
are using culture to get things\ndone for a variety of reasons,
and understanding that\noperating within that landscape
requires some savviness,\nand also, I think,
some self-assessment\nabout impact,
and quite honestly, a\nkind of getting real about
some radical politics\nbecause as much as like this
might seem crazy, right, when\nwe talk about gentrification,
or we talk about the ways in\nwhich urban development is
predominantly funded\nby developers,
we are talking\nabout an occupation,
and we're also talking about\ntechniques of community
development that do not only\nreflect the methodologies that
are deployed by the US military,
but I would say a similar kind\nof ethos at times as well.
And so that produces\nreal problems
as you look in the mirror.
For me.
Not you, maybe.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know how you\nlook in the mirror.
So we'll go to some\nprojects too because I
think it's also good to\nground things in practice.
So you go to view slideshow.
So I work at a place called\nCreative Time, like I said.
I am 45 years old.
And so is Creative Time.
It was founded in 1972.
Oh, what happened?
It just disappeared.
It just disappeared.
Oh, my gosh.
No, no, hold on.
He's coming.
It's OK.
I'll just talk to you for a bit.
Just come over here.
So in 1972, Creative\nTime, which was started
by basically artists who were\ninterested in doing projects
in the city--
you can imagine the urban\nenvironment of New York
'72 was so different than\nNew York City gentrified,
nightmarishly overpriced,\nurban development
city that it is today.
Thank you, brah.
So in 1972, artists were\ninterested in using abandoned
derelict spaces to do projects.
So there was projects\nlike Art on the Beach.
There was projects where they\ndid a drive-in theater, which
is totally impossible\nto imagine now,
where you would just\ndrive your car up
and they would project films\non the sides of buildings.
And it was a way to kind of\ninvigorate the landscape.
And through most of the\n'70s and into the '80s,
that was the kind of language\nof the arts in the city,
that it was a kind of space\nto produce ideas and operate
culturally, but also,\nin a kind of ragtag, not
well-funded, guerrilla aspect.
And for most of the first\n50% of Creative Time's life,
it was a shoestring budget.
And it was much more,\nlike, artist-driven,
in so much as it was\nvery performative
and not in your classic\npublic art sense of, like,
pink sculptures.
It was much more like\nguerrilla activity.
And so I say that because\nthat particular period is
so different than the\nworld we live in now.
Not only is New York\ndifferent, but also the kind
of urban landscape that\none operates within
is also different.
And our budgets are different.
So I've been here since 2007.
And the relationship,\nwhich we'll
get into too, with the art\nin public with developers,
for example.
And there's not just\nan abandoned building
down in Brooklyn we're\njust going to go and do
guerrilla project in.
That's just not the case.
So it is a totally\ndifferent environment.
Let me get into about project.
When I first got\nto Creative Time,
the second project I\nworked on was a project
called "Waiting for Godot in\nNew Orleans" by the artist
Paul Chan.
And this is two years\nafter Hurricane Katrina.
And the idea, which\nwas-- you know,
it's funny because it's not\nan original idea at all.
It was totally, overtly\nborrowed from Susan Sontag,
who\'d done "Waiting\nfor Godot in Sarajevo"
during the Balkan Wars.
And Paul was interested\nin doing Waiting for Godot
in the landscape of\nNew Orleans, because he
said that the\nlandscape reminded him
so much of every production\nof Samuel Beckett's play
that he'd ever seen.
But simultaneously, what became\ninteresting about this project,
and which will feed into the\nconversation around community
engagement, was Paul\neloquently stated
that he wanted to do a play\nwith a front end and a back end,
the front end being the\nproduction of a play,
and the back end being the\nproduction of a public.
And when I think about what that\nmeans, which is just to say--
he also said-- which\nI think was great.
He said, we're gonna to organize\nthis project Hezbollah style.
And I said, what do\nyou mean by that?
He was like, well, we're\njust going to go door to door
and ask people what they need.
And that's how we're going\nto organize this project.
And so he was\ntalking about a kind
of Saul Alinsky, leftist\ncommunity organizing model that
is applied to a very traditional\nkind of theatrical production.
That model of\nworking-- and we could
get into that, because\nit's interesting--
has really informed\na lot of the work
I've done since because the\nproduction of the play, to me,
is not just a production,\nyou could say.
It's just a production\nof a theater.
And we worked, actually, with\nthe Harlem Theater Company
to produce it.
And we also benefited greatly,\nbecause the star of our play
was a gentleman named\nWendell Pierce, who was also
the star of the show Treme.
And he featured prominently\nin the show, The Wire.
I don't know if you\nguys have seen it.
Of course you have,\nbecause that's what we do.
But Wendell Pierce also\nbrought that to play.
But the production\nof a play, what
was fascinating-- and to\nme, that's also in some ways
a symbol of the production\nof artwork, which is,
there is an artwork or a sign.
But then the back end\nis the social relations
that are put into play\nto support the symbol.
And the symbol without the\nsocial forces at play, I think,
is something I'm not as\nmuch interested in anymore.
I'm interested in how putting\na sign into the urban sphere
sets into action an opportunity\nto rethink social relations.
We did simple things.
We hosted community dinners.
We did potlucks.
We worked with local\ncommunity organizations.
And the thematic of waiting\nbecame a profound symbol
for many different things that\npeople were working through
in New Orleans, from waiting for\ntheir FEMA trailer to arrive,
waiting for their asthma test,\nbecause the FEMA trailers had
so much asthma problems, waiting\nfor their insurance checks,
waiting for people to\nreturn, waiting for the city
to actually address\ntheir concerns,
waiting for the federal\ngovernment to provide
any kind of aid.
So waiting became an\nimportant metaphor
to deal with this tragicomic\nterrible situation, which
just to say, is still\nentirely unresolved.
The other thing I'd\nsay too-- and it's
important to bear in mind-- is\nthat was a project around race,
obviously.
And the Hurricane\nKatrina is entirely
a story about race in America.
But when we started working\non it, it was interesting,
because people said to us in the\nwhite community of New Orleans,
oh, you're going to do a play in\nthe Ninth Ward of New Orleans?
No white people\nwill see your play.
And then when we talked\nto organizers of color
in the neighborhood\nand they said,
oh, you're doing a theater play?
No people of color are\ncoming to your play.
So it was like, basically,\nthe word we got from everybody
was no one's coming.
So of course, we took\nthat into our hearts.
And we said, well, then we\ndefinitely should do it.
But we did.
And what was amazing was we had\na very heterogeneous audience.
And it broke down a lot of\nspace around race and class
that really stuck with\nme, because as we all
know, finding spaces that\nare truly mixed race,
mixed class are rare in our\nvery racialized society.
And finding space\nto produce that is
important and meaningful,\nand also something one
should always take note of,\nparticularly in the really
racist, weird art world.
I mean, and it is racist, right?
Most art stuff you go to is\njust like, what the hell?
I did a project by the\nartist Jeremy Deller,
where we took a car--
this is his idea, by the way.
I'm just a supporting guy.
We took a car from Baghdad,\nIraq that had been blown up
in a marketplace bombing.
And we traveled it\nthrough the United States
with a US soldier and a\nIraqi soldier, who had just
come from the war and were\nable to talk to people
about their experiences.
And I'm going to show a clip\nof one of the people talking.
[LAUGHS]
I'm really embarrassed by\nthat picture too, just to say.
Sorry.
Hold on.
Here we go.
Oh, this one will do it.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
- I was a civilian contractor\nwith Kellogg, Brown and Root,
which is a subsidiary\nof Halliburton.
And I was in the Morale,\nWelfare, and Recreation
Programming Department.
There were kind of\nthe regular things
of planning basketball\ntournaments and arm wrestling
tournaments and\nevents like that.
And a lot of what\nI ended up doing
was really off-the-radar,\ninformal kinds of things.
I think one of the most exciting\nand unusual activities that we
started to run was a regular\nPictionary and manicure night.
And this is for US\nmilitary personnel, men.
And they got really excited\nabout Mary Kay manicures
and would come on\na nightly basis
and stand in line to have\ntheir hands softened.
So there were really\nunusual things like that.
- Does that mean\nthey were very bored?
- They were incredibly bored.
They were bored\nout of their minds.
They were in the best\nshape of their lives
because they worked\nout all the time
and really sat around waiting\nto be given things to do.
And also, I think the\nmost shocking thing for me
was experiencing the futility\nof a lot of the missions
that they were sent out to do,\npatrolling just to give them
something to do,\nwhich was insane.
[END PLAYBACK]
But just to say, so this\nproject, if you looked at it,
you would think it was the\nmost boring project ever
because it was a way to get\npeople talking about the war.
And so you would just\nhave two guys sitting
around this blown-up car.
But what was\nfascinating to me was
it was a way to, in some\nways, produce a social space
that wasn't mediated\nby Fox News or CNN,
a way to touch upon the\nconversation of the war that
was open to just discussion\nfrom people that had been there
and get their firsthand\nknowledge from it.
And while we worked on it,\nwhat was fascinating to me
was we were so concerned\nabout getting attacked
by right-wing zealots or\npatriots who felt like this was
very anti-war, but in fact,\nwhere our concerns were totally
opposite of what occurred.
Because the people involved in\nthe war were eager to discuss.
In fact, we found so many\nyoung, like, 20-year-old kids
and 21-year-old\nkids who had already
done a few tours\nthat wanted to talk
about it and their families.
So people touched by the war\nwere the most eager to talk in
public about it.
The pushback we got was\nfrom the left wing, in fact.
A lot of the activists\nsaid, this is ridiculous.
You know, the war is going on.
Why would you put so much money\ntoward something so ambiguous?
You should put something\ntowards something
directly against\nthe war, you know.
And one guy said to\nus, which I thought
was fun, because he had a\nHurricane Katrina moment.
He said, it's as though like\nHurricane Katrina happens
and there's bodies\nin the streets.
And you want to do a project\nabout the merits of Cajun food.
That's not the time\nor place for that.
But I thought that\nwas interesting to me.
Because, of course,\nin some ways,
it was a public art\nproject that people
felt like-- so we\nhave our activists who
felt like it was too ambiguous.
Right?
And then we got a critique\nin The New York Times
that was convinced that it\nwas good therapy for America,
but it certainly\nwasn't an art project.
Just to say, public art is\none of these things where
you have to have very thick\nskin, because you know
it's successful when everyone\ntalks about why it's bad,
which is, like, my whole--
I'm surprised I'm here\nwith you guys at Harvard
because if you look at all my\nreviews, it's all negative.
[LAUGHTER]
But that's the public sphere.
It's like democracy is a world\nof people hating on each other.
[CHUCKLES]
All right, I'm just going to\ngo through a few more projects.
I have so many\nfun little things.
We did a project in\n2010 with the artist
Paul Ramirez Jonas, who I think\nhas done a bunch of projects
up here, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's great.
I love Paul.
So we did a project\ncalled "Key to the City."
I think he's got a\nlittle piece of land
out here that people in\nCambridge have got to key to.
That's right.
So we did this project,\n"Key to the City," which
became the official key to the\ncity of New York for one month.
And Mayor Bloomberg\nactually announced
it, which was pretty fun.
We released 36,000\nof these keys.
You would go Times Square.
And you had to actually\nbestow upon someone.
So it was very ceremonial.
And the key to the city\nthat you would physically
get in your hand after\ndoing this ceremony
would open up physical spaces\nthroughout the Boroughs,
from the super higg-end,\nimportant social capital
spaces, to super\nprivate quiet spaces,
to certain peculiar spaces.
So for example,\nthere was a locker
at Gleasons Gym in Brooklyn\nthat you could open.
You had to go in this boxing\nplace, go in the back area,
open up this locker.
And there was all this\nboxing memorabilia there.
You could go to tortaria.
It's called Tortilla\nNixtamal in Queens.
And you'd go to the back\ndoor, open it with your key.
You could go down these\nstairs and make tortillas
with the people working there.
It was awesome.
You could go to Bryant Park,\nput your key in a light,
and turn it on and off.
Pretty fun!
You could go to the\nBrooklyn Museum.
And it was like Scooby-Doo.
Between these two paintings\nwas a little door,
and you opened it with your key.
And there was a private\nexhibition for you.
Isn't that awesome?
But there was also\na private exhibition
in the mayor's house,\nat Gracie Mansion
because he never lived there.
He's like, sure, you\ncan use the house.
I mean, this project\nwas a total pain.
All of them were a total pain.
But this project was\na pain because we
worked with Port Authority\nto get access to the George
Washington Bridge so\nthat you could open up
the pedestrian walkway to\nwalk across the bridge.
And first of all, I\ndon't think hardly
anybody did it, which is\na shame, since it required
4,000 meetings to get done.
But it is important to be\nable to open up the bridge
to the city, literally.
But what's fun about\nthat too was to me,
the project is kind of a\nmetaphor for public art, which
was it was offering access to\nthings you already had access
to.
And the key becomes\na space of opening up
between the private\nand the public.
And then, for me, Paul\nRamirez Jonas joked.
He said, you know,\nthis is going to become
my cows on parade project.
That's all people ever going\nto want me to do anymore.
But it's a great project.
I kind of wish every\ncity would just do it.
So feel free to steal it.
It's OK.
I mean, but tell him.
We also worked with the artist\nTania Bruguera on a project
called "Immigrant Movement\nInternational," where
she decided to work on\na-- well, the back story
is very funny because\nshe said to me,
I want to start\na political party
for immigrants in America.
And I said, let's do that.
And then I realized what\ndefines a 501(c)(3) is that you
can't start a political party.
So I was like, wait, that's\nthe one project I can't work on
at Creative Time.
But we did start this project\ncalled "Immigrant Movement
International,"\nwhich became a space
to think through the\npolitical imaginary of what
a global immigrant\ncommunity would look like
and how it could function.
And this was in partnership\nwith the Queens Museum.
And so she produced this\nspace in Corona, Queens, which
became a community service\ncenter and a space of thinking
about the global possibilities\nof a citizenry that's
truly international,\nwithout national borders.
And just to give you a sense of\nthe community organizing that
went into this-- because this is\none of those things you can say
is great, but until you\nunderstand the work that goes
into it-- the back end,\nas Paul Chan would say--
you don't know.
And the back end of this-- just\nlet me give you a sense of it.
These are all the\nclasses they offered.
And it continues to go.
So it's been going\nfor six years now.
That's a lot of work.
I worked with the\nartist Suzanne Lacy,
where we worked with community\norganizers and activists,
400 of them women, to do a\nproject between cross-race,
cross-age, and\ncross-disciplinary
on the conversation around\ncontemporary feminism,
basically, and gender rights.
And the way it was orchestrated,\nafter talking to a gazillion
people to get involved\nin this, was to actually
have these kind of conversations\nthat were on stoops across one
street in Brooklyn,\nwhere you could listen in
on the various discussions\nthat people were having.
I'll give you a little\nvideo of that too.
Oh, I'll do that one too.
I'm gonna check my\nemail while I'm here.
[LAUGHTER]
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm running out of time.
I'll do something else for you.
So we'll do this Kara\nWalker project too
because it is kind of\nlike my platinum album.
So we worked with the artist\nKara Walker in the Domino Sugar
factory to do this\ngiant project.
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
So this was a large\nscale sculpture
in the old Domino Sugar\nRefinery plant in Williamsburg.
- --an elaborate, sort of\nmarzipan, or sugar sculpture,
made of sugar paste, a kind\nof fondant that typically,
in these large banquets\nthat would have been thrown
in the medieval era at\nthe court of King Henry.
They would have had a\nmain course and then
a sugar subtlety.
And then people would eat it.
So it had all this kind\nof power of ingesting
this desirable\nprecious substance,
but also, you're\nsort of ingesting
the power of the king.
Anyway, when I heard the term\n"subtlety," I was a goner.
I was like, oh, I have to\nmake a sugar sculpture.
I was like, oh, of course!
- I'm really proud\nthat Creative Time
is undertaking this\nextremely ambitious project.
It's not just\nambitious in scale.
It's ambitious in\nterms of its content.
Kara Walker is\nencouraging us to look
at things that are so visible\nin our society that we wish
were invisible-- our\nhistories of slavery
and our contemporary\nrelationship
to slavery, immigration,\nmigration, mythologizing
of black women's bodies.
And it's our belief\nat Creative Time
that public art creates\na space to engage
in those difficult\nconversations.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- The Domino Sugar factory is\ndoing a large part of the work.
I mean, the accepting\nof the building
itself is creating the context.
And it is, like, the sculpture.
It is kind of the subtlety.
To make a piece that would\nsort of complement it, echo it,
and hopefully that contain\nthese assorted meanings
about imperialism,\nabout slavery,
about the slave trade that\ntraded sugar for bodies
and bodies for sugar.
So these are these\ncast figurines
that were made\nentirely of sugar here.
And then we made this\nenormous Sphinx-like sculpture
that was covered in a\nsugar slurry is the word.
But that's not sugar.\nit was Styrofoam inside.
- --and we started to get\nan understanding of what
parasitism was, a lot of people\nthought that it was impossible.
And so it's been incredibly\nexciting to assemble
this team of problem-solvers\nthat have turned this
into a reality.
- Well, the space\nin and of itself--
[END PLAYBACK]
Anyway, so that\nwas really popular.
I got call them on my phone\nfrom Usher, Usher's people,
asking to go backstage.
And I was like, well,\nit's public art.
It's free and open\nto the public.
Come on down.
Don't have a\nbackstage here, Usher.
But just to say, it was a\nreally impressive project.
People came.
And and also, Kara\nWalker, of course, she's
incredibly brilliant,\nbut she also
understood the\nnature of public art
and really went for the\nmonumental-- literally,
monumentality of it.
And it also,\nfascinatingly enough--
just say something very--
over the years, it's shifted\ndramatically in my experience
with public art is the role\nof social media in terms
its profound ability to\nproduce discussions with art
in public, because I mean,\nevery one of our projects now,
even if no single\nreporter reported on it,
would just become this-- it\njust takes off in social medias
spheres very fast.
I hate the word "grammable,"\nbut it is all very grammable.
But also discursive, it gets\npeople talking and debating
and trolling each other.
But it's interesting, because it\ndoes become a kind of fulcrum,
or a kind of catalyst\nfor a certain kind
of social, civic sense,\nwhich I find extremely
exciting and interesting\nand new, relatively so,
for the work we've been doing.
I want to show\none final project.
And then I will be done-ish.
And it is-- it ought to go here.
So it's funny because--
it's not funny.
But the same year that we\ndid the Kara Walker project,
I also worked on this project,\n"funkgodjazz&medicine,
Black Radical Brooklyn."
And I think Kara\nWalker's project
attracted 145,000 people.
And this project, which I'm sure\nmany of you have not heard of,
attracted 5,200.
So not a success in\nterms of audience.
But I love this project, so\nI have to tell you about it.
It was a partnership\nwith this place called
Weeksville Heritage Center.
And it is a historic\nAfrican-American community
that was started by a\nguy named John Weeks, who
understood that if\nyou owned property,
you were allowed to vote.
And so he started\nencouraging free blacks
to buy property in this area\ncalled Weeksville in order
to produce a self-determined\nblack community
in the early 19th century.
So in 1968, this place\nhad been lost to time.
And a radical anthropology\ngroup from CUNY
actually had heard about\nthe history of Weeksville
and wanted to find out if the\nactual homes or any legacy
of it was still around.
And so they actually flew\na prop plane over Brooklyn
and found three of\nthe original homes,
because they actually\nwent against the grid.
And so they started a community\norganizing effort and made it
a historical home and community\ncenter called Weeksville.
And we partnered with\nthem to do a project
around radical black\nself-determination.
And the site itself is very\ninvested in that narrative.
But I was also, on\na different level--
and something I'm very\ninvested in in terms of this
conversation and just future\nwork is I kept thinking about
how the money is spent as being\none of the most important parts
of a project and\nwhere the resources ,
go not just what it's about,\nbut where the resources actually
end up and who they support.
And so thinking about\nthe money of a project
as going towards sites of black\nself-determination in Brooklyn
and to encourage those\nstruggles and to also support
the people doing that work,\nrather than a project that just
abstractly talks about that.
But I guess, to be simple,\na project that puts
its money where its mouth is.
And so this project, which\nonly had 5,200 people come,
involved partnering artists\nwith community organizations
that embodied that ethos to\nproduce projects together.
And then the idea would be that\nyou would go to see the show
and go to each different site\nof black self-determination
to see an artwork.
So we had the artist Xenobia\nBailey work with the Boys
and Girls High School.
And she worked\nwith a class there.
And then they produced a space\nin one of the historic homes.
We worked with the\nfilmmaker Bradford Young.
He wasn't as famous then.
But he just was up for an\nOscar for cinematography
for that film, Arrival.
And he did this cinematic piece\nwith the Bethel Tabernacle AME
Church, which was the first\nblack-owned church in New York.
And so he worked with\ntheir congregation
to produce a film\nthat was situated
in one of their old buildings.
We worked with the group\nOtabenga Jones and Associates,
with the local jazz consortium,\nto produce an outdoor community
radio center that\nwas in the back
of a chopped-in-half pink\nCadillac with big speakers
in the back that became a\nradical community radio station
that was there for six weeks.
And then we worked with\nthe artist Simone Lee
to do a project called the\n"Free Peoples Medical Clinic,"
inspired in two parts--\none by the history
of radical black\nnurses, and secondly,
with the Black Panthers project\naround doing community health
services in Oakland\nand across the country.
So this actually\nwas a partnership
with a local community\nhealth organization that
had been started by\nJosephine English, who
had been the first black female\nOB-GYN in New York, who also
delivered all six of\nMalcolm X's children,
and was really invested in the\nconversation around community
health.
And so this space became\na way to not only think
about preventative medicine,\nbut also holistic medicine.
She offered workshops of yoga.
And it was weird,\ntoo, because she
had this kind of like\nsci-fi soundtrack in there
and these kind of\nfuturistic, beautiful nurses
that were just like, come in.
And there were herbs everywhere.
And it became this kind\nof community center
that was dreamy and possible\nand really, really popular
and grew and grew.
But just to say, I say that as\nkind of interesting way, maybe
as a way we can kind\nof think through when
we talk about my first\nvideo, which was--
I guess I'd say\ncommunity relations is
a certain kind of way of\nameliorating tensions.
I think there's an important\nway of working where
the resources go towards\nthe struggle and the people
invested in it.
And I do think it is very\nmuch about race in the city.
And it is about not just\ntalking about things,
but where the kind of\ncapital and capacity go.
I also say that\nbecause as you know,
the conversation on\ngentrification and urbanism
is so important.
And it haunts everything we do\nat this point in Creative Time.
And I think it haunts\nmost of the work anybody
is probably doing\nin many cities.
We were joking earlier\nthat I hope when I die,
someone's going to\nlet me know if I
was for the force of good or\nbad because sometimes, it's
really hard to know what force\nyou're fighting for when you've
got developers paying entirely\nfor your projects in cities,
and the forces of\ncapital, really,
not just ambivalent, but very\naggressively exploitative
towards the most oppressed\ncommunities in our country.
So I'm invested in a kind\nof social justice politics
and a radical politics.
But it's not enough\njust to say that.
You actually have to be\nkind of Machiavellian
and radical in terms of the\nways in which you organize
or as you organize Hezbollah\nstyle, if you will.
So that's what I have to say.
It's not your typical approach\nto public art, I know.
But at the same time too,\nI'll say one other thing
the magic of public are for\nthose of you that are not
really interested in public art\nas something you study a lot.
I do believe profoundly\nin the power of art.
And I say that as much as I'm\nvery Marxist and political, I
believe deeply in the power\nof dreams and weirdness
and irrationality and\ndysfunction and unfunctionality
as a space to open up the deeply\npedantic utilitarian space
of the city, to find spaces\nwhere it's not overtly
a commercial or an\nadvertisement to produce space,
or it's about debate,\nit's about wonder,
and it's about the\ncomplexities of the civic that
ignite us together.
Finding room, and I think it\nrequires a bit of a wrestling
match with the\nforces that are very
powerful in the city to\nover-determine everything,
is where the battleground lies.
And I think it's one\nof the great battles.
And as much as we live\nin one of the most
terrifying political climates\nin my lifetime with Trump
as the president, but\nas much as it's easy--
I think it's important\nto push back on that--
I think it's also simultaneously\nimportant to fight
for the power to be\nnon-obvious and ambiguous
and dream at the same\ntime as you fight back.
So thanks so much.
[APPLAUSE]
Is that good?
OK.
Thank you.
So we're going to ask\nAssemble to join us
in conversation with Nato,\nas well as Sandra Branch, who
presented with us this morning.
And maybe just because we\nhadn't planned enough mikes,
I'll stand up here for a second.
[LAUGHTER]
Oh, thanks.
I'll be your interrogator here.
So I guess because I'm normally\nthinking about your work
as being super political\nand socially activist--
and I even remember you from\nbefore you were a curator
as an activist in Chicago, doing\nthese public space projects--
When I get arrested by MTV.
We tried to liberate the\nactors of the "Real World"
from their unreality.
[LAUGHTER]
I'm not joking.
[LAUGHTER]
It was so funny.
They didn't find it funny.
MTV has no sense of\nhumor when it comes
to disrupting their film shoot.
But it was great fun.
So yeah, I thought\nit would be worth
talking a little bit further\nabout the curatorial process
and the intentionality\nbehind it.
Because I mean, of course,\npublic art is always
caught up in all\nthese implications
of the potential\nknock-on effects
for development and inflation\nof value and things like that,
yet the ephemerality\nof a lot of things
that you're doing in\nNew York, I think,
helps prevent them from seeming\nto have a direct impact.
It's not like the\nDomino Sugar development
wasn't going to happen\nif you didn't do
a sculpture in that building.
It was already in\nthe bank essentially.
So can you talk about the\nextent to which you're
able to try to produce\nsocial and political effects
through these projects and\nwhat kind of aspirations
you have as a curator\nto have consequences?
Or is that too far?
That's fine.
So just to say, I\ngrew up as an anarcho.
I thought I was going to be\na professional anarchist when
I grew up.
And then I realized\nthat's totally
such a Berkeley College--
I went to Berkeley, by the\nway, if you can't tell.
But just to say, I\ngot a job at Mass MOCA
after grad school as\nan assistant curator.
And I was convinced\nmy entire life
that the art world was\nevil and that if you
had any radical ideas, they\nwould just kick you out.
And I was actually on trial\nfor this real world thing
when I got my job.
I only say that because\nI found a real connection
with the director there,\nJoe Thompson, no relation,
because while he's\nclearly not a Marxist,
he's raising the dough with\nthe Williams College people.
We did agree on something\nthat I thought helped me a lot
in this, which was\nhe was very populist.
And it's a museum\nin a town of 12,000.
And he was invested in art\nthat spoke to all people.
And so was I. And\nwhile we didn't
have the same\npolitical analysis,
our enthusiasm for a certain\nkind of public discourse
made me understand that the\ncontradictions that capital
could still find\nsome kind of space--
like, my analysis\nand his analysis
could find some\nkind of commingling
in our belief in the\npower of the civic,
and then thinking of the\nmuseum as a civic space.
And that's the\nsame way that I've
been able to wrestle that\nwith Creative Time is
because certainly our\nboard is not Marxist--
but that said, being\nrelevant is helpful for art.
And just to say, on the\nMachiavellian level,
relevant art actually does\nwell for artists and art
organizations.
Go figure.
So it's just to say it's\na strategic maneuvering
through that.
And for me, it's like\nthe production of meaning
is political itself.
Meaningful things is political.
It's a different\nkind of politics.
But finding things that touches\npeople's hearts and gets
them involved and also thinks\nthrough race and class, all
these things, we're\nalready wrestling with.
And art that unpacks that\nand opens it up for people
is exciting.
But it is a bit of a--
I mean, we could get in that.
It is a balancing\nact with trying
to have a politics of liberation\nin a space that's deeply
exploitative and proprietary.
I've got a question about\nthat idea of capital, which
is a term that we've\ncome across a few times,
is the idea of\ncapturing [INAUDIBLE].
Because when You talk\nabout where the money goes,
but I wonder if you could\ntalk a bit more about where
money comes from.
There's a complicit relationship\nbetween who funds these things,
and there's an expectation\nthat we have discovered
a lot in the UK, that\nthere's increasingly
outputs required\nfrom the funding that
has been delivered.
How do you negotiate those two?
I guess it's often quite\noppositional in that--
and what you're saying\nis trying to provide
a kind of slack space for\nalternatives, where actually,
the funders may frequently be\nlooking for the total opposite.
Well, yes, we are\ntoo, because I mean,
we could do an ethnography\nof funding, if you want.
Because it's peculiar.
And obviously, the United States\nhas a very specific and unique
nonprofit system that I know\ny'all over across the pond are
certainly eager to mimic.
But certainly the\nculture of philanthropy
and the systems for\nthat are not the same.
I mean, Creative Time has\nthis interesting space
because it's not just some\npublic arts organization.
It's a public organization\nin New York City, which
is just to say,\nthere is a culture
of philanthropy in New York.
And most of our board\nmembers are already
on museum boards,\nwhich I think offers us
a certain kind of freedom,\nbecause we're the kind of side
project that can be fun,\nwhere I think they might
want their artists represented\nmore in like the Whitney
or MOMA, like, OK,\nnow, show these things.
But we don't get that same\nkind of pressure in that space,
frankly.
And foundations,\nhonestly, it's bizarre.
But I found the social justice\nstuff is much more fun.
The more overtly\ncommunity organizing,
the more foundations are\nlike, yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's what I want.
You know?
So I mean, just to say,\nit's like that stuff,
in a kind of crass way,\nyou can be playing that
up more if you're just\ngoing for the dollars.
The stuff that's\nvery hard to fund
is the art that art world\npeople don't collect and doesn't
directly, obviously lead to\nsome social justice thing.
That's like the black\nhole of no funding.
And it's bizarre, because\npeople would say, oh, wait,
this socially progressive\nstuff, how in the world
do you get funding for that?
But there's funding\nfor that, particularly
in Trump's America.
That's all people\nwant is anything
to get those kind of values\non the table, which leads,
in its own kind of\nindustrial complex way,
to everybody offering\ncommunity organizing
in a kind of crass approach.
You could say people\ndo it just so they
can get the funding dollars.
Right?
We're like, yeah, yeah,\nwe have a community thing.
And they all write it up\nin the grant proposal,
and they say they're doing\nthose things because they
know what the funders want.
And then they use that as a\nway to support something else.
I'm not being mean about it.
But I guess we all\nunderstand that that happens.
I'm curious.
So I think it's\nsomething that we grapple
with within our own projects\nis how you deal with some
of your projects,\nwhich you presented,
which obviously have, I\nsuppose, an initial impulse,
like the immigrant--
Yeah, yeah, Immigrant\nMovement International.
For example, or the medicine\nproject in Brooklyn.
And are they normally\nset up to have
a limited temporal lifespan?
And do they ever grow to\nbecome more permanent?
Or is that something at\nCreative Time that you
help negotiate or try--
I'm curious.
That's a good question.
And certainly, each project\nhas its own kind of situation.
So for particularly with that\none, that was a project--
Tania Bruguera, because she's\nCuban, she said, I'm Cuban,
so I think in five-year\nplans, which I always
thought was funny.
But she was like, I want\nto do this for five years.
That was what she\nsaid from the outset.
And that's what she did.
But at the same time, that\none was a very odd project,
because it was the\none that looked
the most like a non-profit NGO.
It's almost like the\nready made in reverse,
where she was mimicking\nsocial justice organizations
to the point that\nit became a kind
of experimental social\njustice organization.
And so the conversation was\nlike, do we keep that going?
And It's left Tania,\nand it is still going.
And it is its own\noperating thing now.
So that is something that was\nimportant to the work itself.
But just to be fair,\nnot to us, but also
to put our cards\non the table, we
don't have the\nbandwidth or capacity
to do long-term things.
And so if we were\nto do a project that
had a long-term\naspiration, we would
need to negotiate a certain\npartnership that took it over.
You know what I mean?
And that is a certain skill set.
And it's tough\ntoo, because I feel
like one of the mistakes\nwith social justice projects
is where you promise things\nyou can't deliver on.
And you make it seem like you're\ngoing to be around forever,
but you really\nhave no intention.
When we were in New Orleans,\neveryone was like, well,
why don't you stick around\nNew Orleans and stuff?
I'm like, everybody\nunderstood it's a play
and we're going to leave town.
It's not like they're\nlike, oh, my gosh.
I need you to stick\naround forever.
But being very clear\nin your limits, I mean,
I'm sure with your guys'\nwork, you come across that.
Right?
Yeah, no, we've been having\nconversations today really.
And yeah, it's a tricky\nthing to negotiate.
And I think that one of the\nthings that we discussed
earlier was the way that you\ncan unintentionally also become
very emotionally\ninvolved in projects.
And that's something\nthat we have experience,
where we have intended\nthings to be more temporary.
So for example, we\ntalked about a project
to set up an adventure\nplayground in Glasgow.
And the original impulse was\nfor a 12-month play project.
And once we were on the\nground, that aspiration
changed quite quickly.
And we found ourselves willing\nand wanting and working
with the people running\nthe organization there
to try and make the\nsituation more permanent,
because it just felt like\nan important thing to do.
And therefore, I guess that's\nwhere the question is born
from, because I understand\nthe need to negotiate
these relationships,\nand that sometimes you
do need to be able to\nwalk away, as you say.
And a play is a play.
And the curtain comes down.
And other times, you\nsay, well, actually,
what could happen if\nthis could keep going.
I Feel like that's\nthe tricky thing.
It's like how one operates\nwithin a larger ecosystem
is interesting to bear in\nmind, because while Creative
Time does these\nprojects, there's
a certain thing that haunts me.
You start seeing these kind\nof utopian, imaginary spaces
in urban environments\npopping up and disappearing.
Right?
Yesterday, I was\ntalking to someone.
And they were like, well,\nwhat are we supposed
to do about gentrification?
And then my buddy\nTrevor just said, well,
you just get rent control.
Right?
But just to say,\nwhat I mean by that
is you don't set up an\nexperimental community
in a neighborhood to demonstrate\nthe political horizon.
There is a certain\nspace in which
policy is important to address.
And it feels really\nannoying after a while
where we demonstrate--
It's almost like I understand\nwhy we do temporary stuff.
A, we can't.
But also on a mediascape-wise,\nthe attention span
dwindles out, and we've\ngot to do something new.
And so we are, to\nsome degree, complicit
in a certain kind of\nspectacle media logic, where
if you did a project for\n12 years, for example,
you'd get an article\nin the beginning.
And then you'd be\ndone media-wise.
And people would\npat you on the back.
Good work for 12 years, but\nyour funding would disappear.
You know what I mean?
So I feel like the\ntemporality around this stuff
also has its own problematics.
I was just going to--
go ahead.
I also experience that.
I work in a depressed\narea in Flint, Michigan.
And when we put on projects,\nthey're like, oh wow,
I'm glad you did that.
I'm glad you're here.
But the one thing that you don't\nwant to do is promise something
you cannot deliver because\nthen, that sticks with you.
That follows you.
That's the monkey on your back.
Oh, I know her.
She promises the world\nand delivers stones.
Or she's Santa Claus\nwith a bag of coal.
We don't do that.
And that's why I always\ntell them, this is up to you
how far this goes.
If you want this\nto continue, you
must find a way to continue it.
Sustainability is in your hands.
And that's why I always do that.
But I want to know,\nbecause there's not
a lot of funding in\na desert like Flint,
where everybody is in need,\neverybody's got their hand out,
how do you bring that funding?
Even though there's a need\nfor it, it's not available.
And with a depressed\ncommunity like that,
everybody's got their hand out.
And the only funding is\ngoing for water, water.
It's like, forget the arts now.
It's water.
And when we started\ndoing political murals
about the water situation,\nsure, it got a lot of attention.
Everybody was like, wow,\nyeah, oh, that's powerful.
But then the people\nthat will fund you
don't want you to\ndisplay it in their area.
It's like, oh,\nyeah, that's great.
You're doing great work.
But we don't want you\nto bring it over here.
So what do you do\nwith stuff like that?
I mean, I don't know\nthe answer to that.
But it is systemic, obviously.
Right?
I mean, don't you think?
I mean, obviously.
I mean, the funny thing is like,\nif I was a doctor of cities,
and I took my stethoscope,\nand I went over New York,
I wouldn't be like,\nthis city suffers
from a lack of\ncultural programming.
[LAUGHTER]
You know what I mean?
But yet, it just keeps\ncoming, cranking it out.
And everyone's\nlike, oh, we ought
to do an art project here.
But Flint, you could use\nsome cultural programming
over there.
Right?
But where's the\nbang for the buck?
What rich person wants to\nhead out to Flint to do that?
Right?
So there is a structural,\nracist, political component
to these funding models.
That said, I would say--
my gut tells me that's\nKresge is the one to go,
to because they do support\ncultural programming
in the Midwest.
Right?
Is that right?
Kresge has a Detroit program.
And it's very specific to\nthe boundaries of Detroit.
And otherwise, you fall into\nthe larger Kresge Foundation
pot that's nationwide.
But they are in Michigan.
So that's helpful.
I'd say go to Betsy DeVos.
She's very philanthropic.
[LAUGHTER]
Right.
Or Erik Prince.
Sorry.
So I thought I would ask one\nmore question along these lines
and then open it up for\nothers to ask questions.
So Creative Time has\nthis history, actually,
going back, as you said,\nto the 1970s, 1973.
And it was founded essentially\nto activate vacant office
towers that were built in\nthe middle of an oil embargo.
And so there was this kind of\ngreat opportunity of vacancy
that was then taken up by some\nof the cultural organizations
that David Rockefeller\nwas funding.
And even though the\nwork was coming out
of a space of the\nSoho artists community
and kind of a\nradical context, it
was intended to serve as a\ntool of development, something
that I think in our\ncontext in Flint
and in some of your\nprojects in England
is a position that we're\nbeing asked to play.
And in the context of\ncreative place-making,
it's become a formulaic way\nthat public art is being pushed
and being funded to serve.
So I don't know.
What's your reaction to\nthe broader narratives
of public art that are\nprevalent right now?
Well, it\'s just to say,\nthis term, "place-making,"
I don't know how\nubiquitous it is.
So you guys get that word?
You do.
Yeah.
OK.
But I don't want to\nbe snotty about it,
because there are\nsome good parts to it.
So I am being snotty about it.
It's like a\nbackhanded compliment.
There's some good things to it.
But certainly, what's\ninteresting is it is
about art in the public sphere.
And I've watched that learning\ncurve, because at first,
it used to be much more of\nthis creepy, Richard Florida,
creative economies logic.
But then I've seen it\nshift as the conversation
around social justice and race\nhave been pushing themselves
into that.
And the funders,\nI think, have been
much more cognizant in working\nwith that, to think through,
like, what are the implications.
And I also think with the\ngrowth of gentrification
as a narrative\nwithin urban spaces
that you'd have to really\nhave your head in the sand
to not talk about that if you're\ngoing to talk about development
models in cities.
And it is useful\nbecause for me, it's
much better than the\nconversation around art
museums.
At least we're talking\nabout race and class
and political economy\nand urban space.
So in that way, it's been\na very productive space
to interrogate.
At the same time,\nthere is a lot of very
misaligned and\nconfusing politics
that are going into\na lot of money that
is being thrown around.
But just to say, with the\nfunding thing, two parts-- one,
I do think the\nplace-makings one is good.
You got an ArtPlace grant.
Right?
And the other one I'd\nsay is, I think all of us
don't need to defend the arts.
We need to go on arts offensive.
Because I think the NEA's\nbudget should be $1 billion
and not sit there going like,\ncan I please have $30 million?
Because then, you can\nhave a national program
for cultural\nprogramming, because what
we're talking with Flint,\nthat's a federal problem.
That is something that can't\nbe resolved by one foundation
or an arts organization.
That should be a\nsustained program
of social infrastructure.
I mean.
Sorry, I suppose I don't\nhave an articulate response.
But it's making me think\nabout something that I've
noticed a lot in\nthe UK and I feel
is probably more extreme in\nthe US, which is the way that,
I suppose, money for\npublic art projects
is increasingly used by\neither people like us
as well to do projects,\nwhich in some way
are a panacea for things\nthat should be, if you like,
centrally funded.
And I think that's because\nthat's where the holes are,
and they become an interesting\nspace in which to do projects.
But actually, as you\nsay, ideally, that money
shouldn't be coming from these\nsorts of small diffuse spots,
but would be coming\nfrom central government.
Well, yeah, it's funny.
Because like yeah, exactly.
So let's say platform\nheads over to Stockholm.
And it's just a different--\nit's like, you go to Stockholm
and the environment of\ndoing interventionist
or urban development projects\nthat we do in the US,
it's so radically different.
They're like, oh, right.
Well, I mean, we really\ndon't have as many things
to complain about over there.
But like over here,\neveryone's like, look at me!
I'm purifying water.
I'm, like, doing basic needs\nof a community that should
be supported by the state.
That is the lament about\nsocially engaged art
often is that it's\ntrying to put the finger
in the dam of a\ntotal privatization
of all infrastructure.
And we are part of that.
But the same time, it does more\nthan that, I would say, too.
Yeah, I think it's\nsomething though,
that I, as someone who utilizes\nthat for the funding field
to be convicted by, whereas\nyou are, in some ways,
propping up an argument\nabout allowing privatization
and philanthropy as a model\nfor social justice, which
I think in some\nways, politically,
is quite dangerous.
But equally, it's better\nthan doing nothing,
which is the alternative.
In some ways, I\npersonally feel like it's
a quite horrible\ncatch-22, where it's
like you are providing\nbackup for an argument
about enabling social\njustice to be only
through philanthropic\nenterprises.
But also, without\ndoing anything,
that's going to happen.
Where do you intervene?
And where do you just let it go?
I mean, it's really tough.
Because you can start to feel\nlike you're the charter school.
You're like, but I'm a\nwell-intentioned charter
school, but I'm totally playing\ninto this defunding federal
education policies.
So I feel that sometimes too.
But at the same time, to\nbe more fair, it's funny.
To pick on Scandinavia,\nbecause let's do that.
They don't get a full pass.
At least with\nnot-government-funded thing
that we do, we can talk about\nflagrantly race and racism.
We don't have to worry\nabout staying on message
with a giant PR machine.
I mean, there is some\nfreedom in the model
that we have that I\nfind very valuable.
It's bizarre because\nyou can kick and push
a lot more in this\nkind of model, I find.
And that's useful in\nsome ways to just throw
some cards on the table.
I think that's true.
And like, somebody found\nagain, by acting as artists,
we're wearing a\nkind of artist hat.
You can do work that, if you\ncan architecture commission,
people that see them have\ncertain outputs that you've
got to get away with\nbecause it wouldn't fit.
It wouldn't tick\nthe right boxes.
It wouldn't tick the right\nhealth and safety or output
or other thing boxes.
And so there is a\ndefinite argument
for co-opting and\nutilizing funds for art,
because actually, there's\na kind of level of freedom
there, that you don't have\nthe more practical outputs, so
like traditional\narchitectural outputs.
I mean, it's the greatest\npassport of all time.
It's like your biggest visa.
Because when people get\nall utilitarian on you--
they're like, what is that for?
Who does that affect?
How many tourist dollars\ndoes that attract?
You're just like, I'm an artist.
I don't deal with your\npedantic questions.
And sometimes, I feel\nlike, hell, yeah, man.
Sometimes it's good to\npush back like that.
You know?
Well, let's open up to\nquestions, if anybody--
I think there's a mike, a\ncouple of mikes running around,
a few, three.
Hi.
Thanks for the\ninspirational talk.
I'm just wondering-- I had\nthis question for the speakers
this morning as well.
But do you think in time,\nthese projects and this idea
of public art as community\nengagement can be so culturally
influential that it\nwill shape market demand
and kind of allow the market\nto support the initiatives,
rather than being\nsubversive to it?
Or is it only art\nif it's subversive?
I mean, it's already\ngot market demand.
There's an artist named Theaster\nGates who is filthy rich.
And he's doing community\ndevelopment projects
that are very popular with Rahm\nEmanuel and the Chicago Bulls
as big funders.
So just to say, there's\na market out there.
But I wouldn't say it's big.
It's almost like\nwith the art world,
you get, like, three stars,\nand the rest of us go broke.
I do think there's a certain\nkind of market sensibility.
But the arts are\nparticularly fickle.
It is a luxury good.
And it is all about scarcity\nin the arts in particular.
That particular world\nis very scarcity-driven.
And the sad thing\nabout the art world
is that the bigger\nthe wealth gap,
the better the art world\ndoes because, of course,
there's just much more\nluxury money out there.
I did want to address that.
He's right.
It's the 1% that\nyou're going for.
They're the ones that\nhave that money to support
and the money to pay\nfor the projects.
But we hope that yes, it\nstarts a bigger movement that
makes it culturally acceptable.
That's the orgasm we have\nin our brain about this art.
But it doesn't really\npan out that way.
Usually, it's a passion\nthat the artist has,
that he's putting out there.
And he's saying, accept me.
This is part of who I am.
But yet, it's still, in public\nart, a voice of the people.
And so this is what\nthey're saying.
But you can't hear them.
So it's not always\na matter of how much
money, but how much action that\nit inspires because it's art
if it evokes an emotion.
It doesn't have to be good.
The emotion is there.
But also, too, is it Grand\nRapids, the thing, art--
Yeah, ArtPrize.
ArtPrize, right?
Isn't that thing hugely popular?
Yes, very popular.
And they're usually using\nstudents that are unknown.
So they do get a name.
They get their stuff out there.
And it's funded by\nthe DeVos family.
Right?
1%.
My joke used to be that\nthe foundations that
have to give away 1% of their\ncapital every year, and they've
essentially stolen our\ntax dollars by creating
private foundations.
And our job is to\ntake it from them.
I like that guerrilla\nHezbollah thing.
I didn't even know\nI was doing it.
But anyway, any other questions?
Don't be shy.
I think it's very\ninteresting that you said,
I didn't even realize\nthat I was doing it.
I think for a lot\nof people who are
activists and\nartists, that's one
of the most difficult things.
When you are someone who is\nworking within communities,
somebody who is\ncreating projects
that are socially and culturally\nirrelevant, it becomes very
difficult if you are\nnot in an institution
to understand what you're doing\nis relevant to the institution.
So I guess my question\nis, how do you
seek that validation\nwhile understanding
that things like\nfunding are important,
and as we've seen,\nwhile at the same time,
not compromising our\nmission or our message?
Anybody else want to--
OK.
Well, I think that you get your\nvalidation by when people say,
that's what I was saying,\nor that's what I feel.
It's not so much what\nbeing put in a museum,
or being put up on a building.
It's when you reach the\npeople, and when you say,
OK, I'm not the only\none that feels this way.
I'm getting it out.
And I'm representing you\nand you and you and you.
And so together, we are this.
This is our voice.
See, we have a voice\nfor the voiceless.
And that is satisfaction.
And that is knowing that\nyour work is accepted.
And for me, the way\nI would respond,
is that you do all\nthis terrible work
of writing grants and trying\nto bring the money from people.
And then it's difficult.\nThe committee meetings are
difficult. People yell at you.
And sometimes, the projects\nare hated and all of that.
You get trolled all the time.
But the thing that's kind of\nmagical from my point of view,
as someone who's not an\nartist and not a designer,
is that you kind\nof create a process
and you create a\nplatform for people
to create their own work.
And then when it works well,\nyou get to walk into the project
that you never imagined, but\nyou created a space for it
to happen in.
And that's kind\nof a joyous thing
to see other people create in\na place that you've set up for.
Life is a story called,\nyou're not invited.
So I think it's important--
it's funny, because\nthe museums would
make you think that's the work\nthat most people are doing.
But in fact, a lot of the\nsocially engaged art stuff,
there's so many people doing\nthis in cities, like so many.
And it's more the rule\nthan the exception really.
It's just that the spaces\nthat highlight stuff
don't reflect the actual\ncomposition of practice that's
out there.
So I do think finding\nspace to produce community
and solidarity that are not\nreliant on the institutions
is absolutely\nemotionally critical too.
This guy Greg Sholette has\na book called Dark Matter.
But it's talking about the\nidea that with dark matter,
it's the dark matter that\nholds the universe together.
But in the arts, it's a\nlot of these practices that
hold the arts together\nthat isn't actually
in the institutions.
Now, I see that everywhere I go.
There's so many people\ndoing social engaged art.
I mean, it's funny.
It's like such a lame term.
Because I just feel like people\nboth want to make a difference
and also are just\ninherently good
with cultural manipulation.
So that is a modality a lot of\npeople are comfortable with.
Yeah, I mean, I\ntotally agree with you.
And I think what's so evident\nis that the lens that gets shone
on certain people or certain\nprojects is just that.
It's a lens.
And there's a whole broader\nworld out there where
those things don't get seen.
And what can be really\nuseful about those lenses
is that you begin to\nlook back at the world
and see those things that you\nperhaps hadn't valued or hadn't
considered or hadn't seen the\ncultural value in beforehand.
And it makes me think of someone\nlike Jeremy Deller's work.
I don't know if people here\nare that familiar with him.
But he's a British\nartist who works
very much with every day\nculture, largely in the UK,
sort of contemporary folk\nculture, if you like.
And it also makes\nme think a lot--
I know I was at a\nconversation in the UK
with the arts minister\nat the time, Ed Vaizey.
And it was a\nroundtable discussion
about a new kind of arts paper.
And someone raised the\npoint about going out
into an area where\nthere was no culture,
a shit area with no culture.
And I just got so\nangry with this person.
Because it was like,\nhow dare you say that?
How dare you use that term\nto someone else's community?
And it reminds me, I was\ndoing a transcription
of a series of interviews with\nmanagers of Sure Start centers
in the UK, which are basically\nsort of early learning centers.
And one of the\nmanagers saying she
has these very\nin-depth conversations
with young mothers who are\nwhite, working-class mothers,
who say, I wish I was Indian\nbecause my Indian friends,
they've got culture.
They've got saris.
They have delicious food.
And we don't have that.
I have no culture.
And the manager of this\nearly learning center
is like, what are\nyou talking about?
Of course you do.
You have a ritual\nof tea whenever
someone enters your house.
You have your\nbirthday celebrations.
You just need to learn\nthe visual material,
the culture, the everyday\nculture that you inhabit.
And you need to learn\nhow to recognize that.
And so going back to\nthe start of the point,
I think the ability\nthen of certain artists
or practitioners to focus\nthose lenses and say, oh, yeah,
I never thought that that\nthing that I did was culture
or was valuable.
I think that can be an\namazing virtue and joy of some
of this type of work.
Yeah.
And to elaborate on that.
In Flint, where we are that\nshit area that they say
has no culture.
And when the plants left\nand half of the residents
left, and they left all\nof these empty homes that
are vacant and left to\ngo through the process
of gentrification so they\ncan cleanse the city--
she's right about the lense.
I have to go into\neach neighborhood.
And my project varies\nwith each neighborhood,
because I engage community.
And I say, what is your culture?
And they say, what?
We're black, or we're\nthis or we're that?
No, no, that's who you are.
Your culture is what you do,\nthe rituals that you have.
It's how you live.
It's how you enjoy.
It's how you celebrate.
And so I say, what\nis your flavor?
Well, they've got\na lot of flavor.
Oh, we do this.
We do that.
That's their culture.
And I focus a lens on that.
And I bring it out through\nthe murals that we do.
And I say, OK, this is the\nflavor of this neighborhood.
And that mural is the\nculture of that area.
Even though we're one people--
We're all American-- there's\nlittle microcosms of culture.
Maybe it's with\nthese three houses.
Maybe it's with this block.
Maybe it's with this\nwhole neighborhood.
Maybe it's with this community.
But you have to be that\nlens that says, I see you,
and I hear you.
And that validates them.
So when talking about\ndeveloping culture
or identifying\nthose cultures that
exist in those\nneighborhoods, how
do you find that balance\nbetween that culture
attracting more\ndevelopment, and with that,
gentrification, and then killing\nthat culture that was vibrant
and then this full circle\nthat goes over and over?
Well, actually, we just remind\nthem of where they came from
and remind them of\nwhat their culture was.
And then we also put\nup there what it was
and what it has turned into.
Because it's always evolving.
When these people move in\nand these people move out,
it changes.
At one time, this was\na predominantly white
neighborhood that\nended up going black.
And then it ended\nup going empty.
And then it ended\nup going abandoned.
But still, there are still\nspots of that culture.
And you just have to say,\nwhen they forget what it was,
remind them of who they are.
And it's still there.
So you deal with it as it comes.
And it's fluid.
And you have to know\nthat it's organic
and it's going to change and\nyou can't keep it that way.
It is what it is.
I think that's kind\nof key is that there's
an undertone to some of the\ngentrification conversation
that actually what\nyou want to do
is keep things in total stasis.
And I think like\nthings will change.
And I think, for me,\nthe bigger question is,
who benefits from\nthose changes, and how,
through the\nstructure of the work
and the creation\nof organizations,
or the impact of the work, you\ncan share benefits more widely,
rather than aim for a stasis,\nwhich is self-defeating.
And a lot of these areas\nhave real social problems
that do need investment.
And where there's\ninvestments, there
is going to be a change\nand gentrification.
And trying to stop it\ncompletely is a losing game.
So it's more like,\nhow do you reframe it?
How do you share the benefits?
How do you change--
And I guess that's where\nthat question also of capital
and economy comes in\nand how you start--
the culture is a way of also\npeople seeing value and seeing
agency in what they're doing.
And also, it enables them\nto take on ownership.
And it is a kind\nof pride thing that
also means that when\nchanges do come,
people are much better\nable to take control of it,
rather than just\nbe victims of it.
I think it's almost\njust like changing
the narrative about what the\nvalue relative values are
can have a huge impact\non that process.
And you also have to explain to\nthem what process is going on,
because when they're\nin it, they don't
see that it's gentrification\nuntil you explain it to them.
You say, this is the\nprocess that's going on.
And you can't be\noutside here, saying,
we're getting mowed over.
You have to actually\ngo to the table.
You have to have a\nseat at the table
before they can\ngive you a plate.
So if you're not part of\nthe process, if you don't
get into the meetings\nwith those people,
go to your city meetings\nand tell them what to do,
empower them to be at that table\nso that they don't get mowed
over, they don't get lost.
Because it's\ninvestment in people.
And the big businesses they\nhave the money, or the schools
or whoever is doing the\nprocess of gentrification,
they don't want to be\nlabeled as the villain.
You put that Snidely\nWhiplash hat on them,
and all of a\nsudden, they change.
Oh, no, no, we want you.
We want you here.
So you tell them how to\nget a seat at the table,
because change is never\ndone from the outside.
It's done from the inside.
Sorry.
I had a slight aside,\nbut partly because I
feel like maybe there's a\nstrand of the conversation which
is about, if you like,\ngoing into a context
and doing a project.
And I think, for me,\nit's also very personal.
It's like I've benefited from\nmany public art projects.
So I've benefited from\naccess to the arts
throughout my whole life.
And for me, that's so much\nanother dimension of how
I see the world and an ability\nto feel like I can understand
and engage with the world\nof visual and material
culture, which is such an\nimportant element of this world
we're in that is\nfull of images and I
think is really underrepresented\nin our education systems.
And actually, to\ngo back to where
Paul's talk ended on moments of\nambiguity or moments of joy--
I remember the first time when\nI went to a project in the UK
that was done by Artangel,\nwhich is sort of similar.
It's a UK production\ncompany, which was in--
the Round House, in the '90s,\nwhich was a big train shed,
which is now an arts venue.
But it was before it\nhad been renovated.
And they'd filled\nthe whole space
with a white bouncy castle.
I think it was by Michael Landy.
I had no idea.
I was, like, eight years old.
I only discovered this\nmany, many years later.
But I remember that\nsort of surreal moment
and that joy that can come\nwith something like that, just
the ability to experience\nthe city differently,
to feel like, it's yeah, this\nopen-ended, malleable thing,
and as a child, what\nthat feels like.
And then when you talk about\nyour project with the keys
to the city, there are\nno concrete outcomes.
It's going to be very hard\nto tick a box on a form.
But actually, these\nthings make a difference,
and they're cumulative.
And I think they do enrich all\nof our experiences of the built
environment.
I mean, just to say one thing\nabout the gentrification thing.
It's a tricky little wicket.
I mean, I think it\nis good to always be
strategic in terms of context.
And New York City, for example,\nis very different than Flint
in terms of the\nspeed of urbanism,
how much speculative\ncapital's out there
for development and stuff.
So I mean, I say that because\nwhen we did that Weeksville
project, it was really\ncrazy, because there's
a sad part to that\nstory, which was
just that this is in\na neighborhood called
Bedford-Stuyvesant.
It's on the border of\nBed-Stuy and Crown Heights.
And I think it's\nreally important
to bring up these sites of\nblack self-determination.
But as we were doing\ncommunity organizing, I mean,
everybody in the\nneighborhood was
basically like, it's a\ndone deal, like it's done.
While we are working\nwith them, the place
of Josephine English's\nhistoric home,
the guy who owned\nthe building was just
looking for the highest bidder\nwhile we're working with him.
And when Weeksville\nactually had the city
pay for a LEEDS-certified,\ngiant architectural building,
they literally did\nthe ribbon-cutting
while we were doing\nthe opening of the show
and had to fire the entire staff\nand had a staff of two people.
So they had literally\nbrand new computers,
state-of-the-art everything.
But of course, the city gives\nno money to actual operating
expenses, but they\npat themselves
on the back for helping\nthis civic organization.
But of course, they got no\nfunding for this organization
on the operating level.
But it seemed to me it was\nalmost this structural racism.
In certain kind of\nhyper-developed moments,
you have-- to have\na certain kind of--
I don't know what it is.
It felt like that Waiting\nfor Godot project,
like you almost have to have an\nalmost epic, existential sense
of like irony and\ntragedy at the same time,
because it is hard to confront\nthat kind of shit, man,
in the neighborhoods.
The mayors, nobody in the\ncity can stand up to it.
The mayor can't.
De Blasio runs on\na platform of like,
we're going to stop\nthe developers.
You see how that went.
So I just think when\nan arts organization--
it's a tough thing.
And I also don't want to\nlie to ourselves about it
in certain places.
When I worked in North Adams,\nthey wanted gentrification
and still do.
They're like, hey, I\nwould take any business.
And it's a different narrative.
So I do think it's\nimportant to be
contextual about the\npolitical economy fights
that you're dealing with.
And it's tough for me too\nbecause with Creative Time,
you want to address\nthese issues.
But sometimes I do\nthe math in my head,
and there's some really bad\nmath that's coming down.
You know?
Yeah, sometimes I tell the\nresidents in the area--
I'm like, it's going to happen.
It's going to happen.
They're going to come in here,\nand you're going to be gone.
This is life.
Life isn't fair.
This is truth.
So what we do is we shine\na light, the brightest
light we can, for as\nlong as you're here.
And that's all we can do.
So we're a bit over time.
But I just wanted to\nask one last question
to do with your book, which\nis dealing with these very
hot topics of the way that\nculture is almost at war
with us and our\nsociety and being
used as a tool of propaganda.
And at the same time,\nthere are these forces
that are trying to use\nculture for liberation.
And it's striking\nin your talking
about the curatorial\nwork at Creative Time.
One would think that as a\nsocial-political activist,
you would be doing more\nconfrontational work,
or trying to promote\nmore provocations.
But actually, the way that\nyou're talking about it
sounds more like community\nbuilding and mediation
or softening the\neffect of cultures.
So can you talk about that?
Well, first of\nall, I got to say--
Bernie Sanders almost won.
And there's no Bernie\nSanders without Occupy Wall
There's no Bernie Sanders\nwithout Black Lives Matter.
There's no Bernie Sanders\nwithout Standing Rock.
So just to say, when people\nsay social movements don't
have impact, they totally do.
And when people\nsay, oh, what did
the artists relate to social\nmovements, everybody--
it's all cultural producers\nin these things now.
Culture-making and social\nmovements are very ingrained.
And I say that to go to\nyour point, because I do
think the slow work\nof social building
and social producing\nalternative visions of a future
is having effects.
Like, I see it in the\npolitical discourse
that we are experiencing today.
As much as Trump's\nin office, there
is also a very\nprogressive challenge
to overarching\nneoliberal capital that
is being articulated globally in\ncountry to country to country.
And it's well long overdue.
But I think it's important\nin these moments with Trump
there to remind ourselves\nof some progress.
Whatever you feel about\nBernie, I'm just saying,
there is a vision that is\nmuch more specifically talking
about capitalism, that says\nthe word "socialism," that
talks about an ability to combat\nflagrant speculative money
running the world.
That is being articulated\nin a very profound way.
And I do credit a\nlot of this culture,
socially-engaged\ndo-gooder stuff as a part
of the ecosystem\nthat is producing
a global collective\nsubjectivity.
That is out there.
So I think it's OK.
Jeff Chang wrote this\nreally great book.
I forget what it's called, it's\nlike Who We Be or something.
But he talked about\nculture-making being part
of a wave.
And no water molecule see\nhow it plays in the wave.
Right?
But we are all part\nof a bigger push.
And it's slower than\ndirect push sometimes.
And I think that's\nOK, because I feel it.
I feel it.
I feel it.
I feel it in everything.
I think it's good to\nhave moments of hope,
because right now,\nI think we're all
realizing this dude's literally\nin office for a while.
[LAUGHS]
All right.
On that note--
[LAUGHTER]
Thanks.
Thank you, Nato.
