So thank you very\nmuch for being here.
We're really delighted\nthat Liam Gillick
is with us here tonight.
Liam doesn't know it\nhimself, but actually I've
been hoping that we would have\nyou here for quite some time.
We have some mutual\nfriends, and I
was hoping to be able to use\nthem before to get to you.
And so I'm very happy\nthat you are here.
I think in the context\nof our school, it's--
in a way--
I think quite exciting, quite\ninteresting to have Liam here.
Because in some ways\nLiam deals with color,
with sites, with relations,\nwith words, with juxtapositions,
with lights, with\nmovement, with perception,
with elements of art.
And many of the things that\nLiam deals with, in some ways,
are very architectural.
In a way, they are\ndesigned based.
And yet, maybe it's not exactly\narchitecture what you're doing,
nor is it exactly design.
But some of the\nactivities I think
there is a resemblance to\nwhat some of the people
do in this building.
And inasmuch as there is\nso much on the kind of--
the relationship of elements,\nand in terms of rethinking
the whole space of exhibition.
It seems more and\nmore it's getting
to have parallel analogies\nwith architecture.
And yet, I think it's\nreally productive that it
is something very different.
And I hope that that will be\nsomething that, Liam, you will
talk about during your lecture.
It's also really\nastonishing the kind
of range of collaborations and\nengagements that Liam has had.
And beyond his own sculptures,\ninstallations, exhibitions,
to be so involved with writing\nabout contemporary art,
and collaborating with so\nmany people on the topic.
Liam's, work as\nyou probably know,
has been also exhibited in a\nnumber of significant locations
and events, including\n[inaudible] at the Venice,
Berlin, and Istanbul Biennale.
And he somehow has managed to\nrepresent Germany in the 2009
Venice Biennale, despite the\nfact that he's not German.
Which is also very\ninteresting that he did that.
He's also had solo\nmuseum exhibitions
at the Museum of\nContemporary Art in Chicago,
the Museum of Modern Art in\nNew York, and at the Tate
in London.
And over the last 25 years,\nin terms of his writings,
he's contributed to Art\nForum, October, Freeze, E Flux
Journal.
And is the author of\na number of books,
including a set of essays of\nhis own, and also writing.
In a way.
On the history of\ncontemporary art practice.
Which I suppose one of\nthe key things about it
is the degree to\nwhich it actually
does engage with social\npolitical issues of the day.
And the role of the\nartist as someone
who's deeply engaged in\nconditions of everyday life,
and is very much participating\nin those situations.
I'm really delighted that\nLiam is with us tonight,
and I look forward to\nhearing your presentation.
Please warmly\nwelcome Liam Gillick.
Good evening.
It's good that you came\ntonight, with the new weather.
So what I'm going to do\nis to try and give you
some information, some\nbackground, about what I've
been doing.
And to give you a\nframework for that.
And then try and talk\nabout some of the ideas
in the book that I published\nlast year, which is a kind of--
an attempt to look\nat the history
of the contemporary\narts as a figure
really, much more\nthan contemporary art
as a discipline.
It's to look at an attempt to\naddress the question of how
do we end up with this\nfigure in society that
seems to represent something?
That's often hard to\nput your finger on.
It's often an implicated figure.
It's a person that can be\naccused of things, like being
a driver of gentrification in\na kind of vague way, right?
A purveyor of the--
in a sense a kind of middle brow\nkind of nonsense, in a sense.
A super self-conscious\npurveyor of ideas,
yet we're not quite sure what\nthose ideas are leading to.
A kind of prime hypocrite,\nin a way, in society
that maybe forms--
has the same role right\nnow as being a poet
might have had in\nthe 1960s, right.
A kind of-- you\nknow, my parents they
had friends who decided to\ndrive to Australia in a Rhino
Four in 1968.
And the guy was a poet.
And I remember that guy,\nand he had all the qualities
of what we would now think a\ncontemporary artist would be.
A bit-- he'd clearly\nhad some basis of ideas.
He had some consciousness\nof modernism
and the history of poetry.
He also was completely deluded\nabout his role in society,
in a way, and his importance.
He felt he had a connection to\nsomething urgent, in that case
it was popular\nmusic, rock music.
He was also cool in\nan indefinable way,
and felt that time for him\nwas different than time
for other people.
I'm not saying you can\nmake a direct analogy
between these two\ntypes of figure.
But you can also say that for\na contemporary artist, as it
were, the same fate potentially\nstands in front of them
as the fate of the poet, kind\nof a hip poet in the 1960s.
So we'll come to\nthat a little bit.
So this question of\narchitecture came up
at the beginning-- in the\nintroduction-- which is good.
And I have--
I'm nervous in a way,\nbecause my kind of weakness
is my admiration for\narchitects and people
who think hard about planning\nand building and doing
something in the world.
The analogy I gave to\nPaige earlier about this,
over the years I've considered.
Which is, I think\nart and architecture
is like apples and bears.
Which means that it sounds\nlike you're saying apples
and pears-- which are related--
but it's actually\napples and bears.
It's a misheard thing.
So, in fact, there is a great\ngulf between these disciplines.
And over the years\nI've thought--
and I've been involved\nin tons of talks
about art and\narchitecture or art
as architecture or\narchitecture and art.
And, obviously,\nthe idea has been
to encourage this\nidea there should
be a melding of these things,\nor a kind of crossover.
And over the years I've\nthought more and more
there shouldn't be a crossover.
There should be more difference\nand more discrimination.
In a sense, between\ndifferent practices.
And in a way what, therefore,\nhas happened in my work over
the years is I've come\nvery close to things.
And it's very different\ncoming close to something,
having proximity-- in the sense\nthat a [inaudible] would talk
about proximity, for example--
is very different from\ncollaborating or merging
or being together.
So I'll try to get to the\npoint and show you some images.
And it's always a\nscary one to show
because it's you start to think,\noh, God if he's showing this,
we'll be going through\nthis like year by year.
But this is the first\nand last painting.
This is from 1987, it\ntells you something.
It's a portrait of Adi Dessler.
And Adi and his brother Rudy\nwere sports shoe manufacturers
in Germany.
One founded Puma, and\none founded Adidas.
And this was the sort of work\nI was doing as I left college.
Which was greeted with\na resounding two one--
if anyone knows\nwhat that means--
in British terms.
And it's a tea tray.
And in Walden two\nby B.F. Skinner
you notice the mentioning of\ntea trays, better tea trays.
So I leave art\nschool, and then this
is the first exhibition in 1989.
And that was very\nimportant for me.
I wanted to-- I\nthought maybe one
day it would be good to be able\nto say I was an 80s artist.
So in 1989-- in 1989, I\nwas running out of time.
And I had a chance to do an\nexhibition, and I jumped at it.
And it was in December 1989.
And I had no money\nand no materials,
but I had a Mac SE\n30 and a printer.
So what I'd been doing\nthrough that year
was every day I would work\non a parallel activity.
In this case I was working\non the facades of buildings.
And I'd use the first\ndrawing program on an airport
to design facades of buildings.
And I'd do maybe 80\na day, or 100 a day.
And in the exhibition\nI made 84 of them.
And we handed them\nout at the opening.
And people would look at them,\nand then they could buy them
in boxes like that.
This is jumping-- thankfully\nthere are these big jumps--
to a little bit later.
This is a room in\nthat exhibition
in Frankfurt in 1999.
And I decided to give over\none room in the exhibition
as a space for a\nconference on criticism.
And so you can\nsee, again, another
of this kind of parallel.
It's like working in parallel.
And the room was used for\nthree days to talk about,
of course, the word that goes\nvery well with criticism,
which is crisis.
The crisis of criticism,\nespecially in Germany.
And it has a joke by Matthew\nModine about Steven Spielberg
and Stanley Kubrick on the\nwall to remind the people
while they're having\ntheir conference
on the crisis of criticism\nmay be about, I don't know,
death for example.
Because it's about--\nit's an old joke
that works with other people.
It would work very well\nwith architects, of course.
It's a joke, you know, that\nSteven Spielberg dies and goes
to heaven.
And St. Peter meets him at\nthe gates and says, you know,
we love your films.
You're great.
If there's anything\nyou need, just ask us.
And he says, well, I always\nwanted to meet Stanley Kubrick.
And they say, you know,\nStanley doesn't do meetings.
You know that.
But we'll see what we can do.
And he keeps going on\nand on, and he never
gets to meet Stanley Kubrick.
And finally one day\nhe sees this old guy
with a beard riding around on a\nbicycle in an old army jacket.
And he says, hey,\nlook that's him.
That's Stanley Kubrick.
And of course the punch\nline-- which is the old joke--
is that's not Stanley\nKubrick, that's God.
He just thinks he's\nStanley Kubrick.
So it was good to have that\njoke there for three days,
because it really\nstarts to be irritating.
But it did have some\neffect on the discussion.
Oh materials, dyed jute--
or hessian they\ncall it in England--
and chipboard, and vinyl.
Again, showing this\nkind of weak materials.
This is a prototype manuscript\nfor a book I wrote around
that time called\nErasmus is Late,
which is about the meeting\nof secondary individuals
over time.
This is a hall outside\nthe porticos in Frankfurt
that I dug with another artist\ncalled Angela Bullock that
was during an exhibition\nabout football and karaoke.
So we decided we would\ntake Capri football--
prior karaoke position--
and instead consider\nourselves medieval.
So we did a project called We\nAre Medieval, which involved
digging a kind of pig hunting\nhole outside the porticos
and sitting in it, and not\nentering the museum at all.
So, again, you have\nthis parallelism.
In this case, the sense of\nnot wanting to be included,
the kind of Bertrand\nRussell-esque
sense of not wanting to be\nin the set of all the artists
who are obviously into karaoke\nand football in the 90s.
Another similar type\nthing that shows itself
in a slightly different\nway, which is a clock.
What, I guess--
I don't know-- in\nGermany I think
we were calling it [? lampin ?]\ntechnique or something.
You know, where you\nhave light bulbs.
And the clock, in this case, is\nflicking in time between 1810,
and 1997.
And it's telling you where--
it's telling you local\ntime before railways.
Introduced a kind\nof universal time,
as it were, and\nthe time in 1810.
So of course wrong in\nterms of the railway,
and then right in\nterms of the railway.
So you have this\nflickering with time,
without using a\ntime-based media.
So what you can see\nwith these things
is a kind of\nintegration in a way.
Like a response to\nconditions, a certain
lightness of touch, a use\nof just a big ream of paper
with some printing on it.
Things being\nprototypes or parallel,
not actually having a\nprimary way of existing.
And around this time I started\nto produce more recognizably
abstract sculptures.
And here we see some in probably\nthe early 2000s in London.
And you see this statement in\nthe background, the commune
itself becomes a superstate.
So one of the things that was\nalluded to in the introduction
is this sense of\nthe relationship
between the individual\nand the group.
Which is always a\ncomplicated one,
in terms of art history\nand art practice.
The fact, for example, that\nat an art school like the one
I went to, you couldn't work\nin that group very easily.
All the critics, all the\nassessments were based
on your individual practice, .
On your individual work
Yet through this period\nwhen you're seeing--
and I'm doing it myself--
these individual works, they're\nalways done in the context.
There's always other\nartists around,
there's a museum around,\nand importantly there
are curators around.
What I started to do by making\nthese works is what I now
understand is a kind of\nschizophrenic practice.
But that's a misuse of\nthe word schizophrenic.
I think it's more--
excuse anyone here who\nhas issues like this,
it's hard to make allusions\nto things without using
certain terminology--
let's say an irreconcilable\nrift in the work
between a kind of\nformalist you could say,
or abstract practice\non one hand,
and some of the other\nthings I was showing you.
All right.
So these I've worked on\nfor the last 20 years.
And they're, in a\nway, a more precisely
abstract secondary function.
They're screens, full\nceilings, wall panels,
small freestanding screens.
I call them fins.
And these things-- which what\nthe hell do I call them--
elevations.
So this is where it gets\nkind of complicated.
And here we can see some\npeople enjoying some platforms
and benches.
So what's going on?
There seems to be this kind\nof unresolvable problem
between these small gestures,\nthese collaborations,
these moments of\ndelicacy sometimes,
and these clearly built,\nconstructed, fabricated things.
The thing is the\ntitles of these works
always give something away.
Some of the overhead platforms\nI always called them, well,
first platforms rather\nthan full ceilings.
Discussion platform, but also\nmaybe development platform
or revision platform\nor a deviation screen
or conciliation screen.
Basically the wording\nand the vocabulary from--
in a sense the things that\nbecame concrete politically
under Clinton and Blair--
and especially the\naesthetics, and the attitude
towards cultural policy\nthat came out-- especially
under people like Tony Blair\nand the third way politicians.
And there's a whole\nbody of my work that
happens both delicately\nand very precisely that
plays with the coding of\nrenovation, compromise,
rejuvenation, clouding,\nsecondary components.
And if you could say that\nCarl Andre's work, right--
and he has written and\ntalked about this--
the use of plates on the\nground doing what plates do.
Or lugs, you know,\nlumps of wood doing
what wood does come from\nthe influence of being
around the rail yards\nin Quincy, right?
My work comes from being\naround that moment.
Being in that moment.
Being in my early 30s\nduring that moment,
and trying to develop\na language that
was appropriate to my time\nthat would be critically
conscious of the conditions of\nproduction that were around me.
And here we see a quarter\nscale model of a public project
for a plaza in Guadalajara.
And here we see what\nhappened quite quickly
as people would\nsay, OK, you seem
to think about these things.
So maybe you can help\nus with our problem.
This is the Interior Ministry\nor Home Office in London.
A project from\n2002 to 2005, when
I was brought in to a public\nprivate partnership which
had all the accompanying\nideas that you have to spend
a percent on the art budget.
But there was a crisis\nwithin the architecture
of the building, which is\na Terry Farrell building.
He's not a very\nfashionable architect,
but is actually kind of\nan interesting person.
So I basically\nwork on all aspects
of the facade of this\nbuilding, and introduced
some of the things\nI've been playing
with about with the\nother work, kind of
to emphasize these things.
Here we see a shot of the front.
And like a treatment of the\nfacade, which was in order
to stop them putting those logos\nthat they put on government
buildings with the kind of\nswoopy thing or to rebrand it.
To make it very hard to rebrand\nand remark the building.
And you can see--
where is my laser--
here, this is the\nsign for the building.
It says The Home Office.
There's another one up here.
And then this thing,\nthese are designated
as artworks within the\ncollection of the government
art collection.
So to have them removed\nis very, very difficult.
So when different governments\ncome and go in Britain,
when the conservatives\ncame in a few years ago,
they really wanted to put a\ngreat big kind of big shield
thing with like rampant lions\nand or maybe a swoopy thing
going to the right\nand up to the right.
But they can't do it without\ngetting a special order
to remove the artwork.
And as I was joking\nearlier, though,
probably the most important\npart of the project for me
was being in the conversation,\nin the discussion, in the room.
And it was the use of the color\nRahul 9035 for the building.
Where I would often\nfind myself in meetings
with quite serious people.
And finally, someone turned\nto me and said, well,
what color should it be?
And I knew it should\nbe Rahul 9035, which
is the kind of thing that\nonly an artist can sometimes
say in those situations.
I didn't have to prove\nit or show it or do
a series of studies,\nI could just say it.
It's a very different thing.
It's apples and bears, right?
This is the facade of the\nFairmont Hotel in Vancouver.
And it has a work\non it that probably
explains things the best.
Which is stainless\nsteel lettering that
says, lying on\ntop of a building,
the clouds look no\nnearer than they had
when I was lying on the street.
Which, in a way, is an\nextraordinary gesture
of Canadian sophistication\nor duplicity
to allow this comment to\ngo on the building that
critiques the building.
And, yet, makes the building\ncool at the same time.
This is a building\nin Guadalajara,
in Mexico, that I worked\nwith with an architect called
Rodrigo Gonzalez Villasenor.
And it looks like\nwe kind of just
knocked it up in a few days,\nand that's sort of what we did.
So in that case,\nmost of this work--
again seen as artwork\nand art commission
and not architecture.
Including what you could\nimagine, this kind of stuff,
but not the carpet, not\nthis, but these things.
I would go on the\nsite as an artist,
right, with a studio\nof people that
came who were often\nthe same people who
were building the building.
Except, nominally, now\nthey were making art,
so they are paid differently\nand acted differently
and spoke differently,\neven though they
were doing the same thing that\nthey'd been doing earlier.
And we would basically--
I would draw on my computer.
We had outputs and things.
We'd blow them up, and then we'd\nbasically weld things together
and put them together on site.
And I'd come and have a look.
It was extraordinary\nfree way to work,
and highly unusual, and\noutside most of the parameters
of with the building planning\nand coding for the building.
But anyway, this is a model.
This comes to Venice now.
I'll show you a few\nphotos of Venice Biennale.
I try not to get\ninto it too much.
But I got invited\nas that 90s person
that I mentioned\nearlier, the one who'd
thought hard about\nthird way post war
conditions and aesthetics.
And also it's a sacrifice, in a\nway, because you get brutalized
doing the German pavilion.
I mean, that's the\nway it should be.
It should have a\ncritical culture
and a critical environment.
In this case, what\nI did is I moved
my rather elliptical\nand secondary thinking
one step across.
So the abstraction became more\nprecise, and more referential.
And the voice became\nmore singular, and more--
less general.
So I started by raising\nmoney for the project
by making a model of the\nunbuilt German pavilion
from the 1950s that would have\ncompletely erased, in a sense,
the Nazi renovation of the\noriginal Bavarian pavilion.
I then worked on the great unit,\nwhich you will probably know
and probably should\nbe working with,
which is the kitchen cabinet,\nwhich is 60 centimeters by 60
by whatever 75 varying heights.
And I spent a lot of time\nsitting in the Frankfurt
kitchen in the MAK\nin Vienna that was
made by the great\n[? architecturan ?]
Margarete Schutte-Lihotzky.
And as a tribute to her\nattempt to make a better
life for people and to have a\ngood 20th century as a German,
I put bug blinds in the\ndoorway of the German pavilion
to attempt to domesticate\nand de-Nazify this building.
And a kitchen inside--
a kind of a cheap kitchen-- but\nan ideal kitchen in a sense.
The unit that's\ncommon, that you can
find in Ramallah or\nBolivia or the [inaudible]
store in downtown Cambridge,\nif there is a downtown here.
And then on the top of the\ncabinets, they put a cat.
And the cat is obviously dead.
And the cat has--
the cat speaks.
And the cat tells a story\nabout a speaking cat.
The cat as the kitchen cat.
The cat who survives\neverything, and the cat who
sees everything and experiences\nevery trauma and tiptoes
through rubble, for example.
And the cat is sad one\nday, because it's--
you know what, you can\nfind the story online.
But I had a lot\nof fun doing this.
And I have to say no good deed\ngoes unpunished in Germany.
So, of course, I did feel like\nyou probably feel sometimes,
completely misunderstood for\nthe first time in my life.
And I only have myself\nto blame for that.
So there you go.
The one good thing--
I don't know if anyone's\nfamiliar with the TV program
Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
But I am a big--
artists like many of you\nprobably at some point
go through a big phase-- is\nwhat's pre-internet really.
So watching daytime TV.
So I was a big fan\nof Clarissa Tells It
All and Sabrina\nthe Teenage Witch,
and Charmed, because they\nwere always on in the morning.
And, of course,\nthere's a speaking cat
in Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
So I always wanted to work with\nthe wise, wry, ironic speaking
cat.
But the night\nbefore the opening,
I realized that this cat telling\nthe story about speaking cat
going in this circular\nself loathing story,
having been accused of stealing\npeople's breath while they
sleep, turning back on the\nhumans, turning back on people
and reminding them it's they\nthat steal people's breath.
It's they that take away joy.
It's they that\ndestroy everything.
I took the gallery guide,\nwhich is this thing, it's here.
It's the gallery guide, right?
It's the thing with a\nlittle bit of information
saying that I did documenter\nand I did a show here
and a show there.
And I screwed it up\ninto a bow type shape,
and I jammed to the\nmechanism of the cat
by stuffing it in its mouth.
But it still was trying to\nmove like [? westworld. ?] It
was still kind of [grunts].
So I got a long nail\nand waited till everyone
had gone-- this is the\nnight before the opening--
and got the nail and stuffed\nit through the piece of paper
into the cat's mouth, which\nfinally jammed the mechanism.
And I remember walking away\nfrom the building as fast
as possible thinking,\nI've just done
the most evil thing in history.
So I can't really\nsay more than that.
It's just there\nare these moments--
and I'm sure you\nhave them-- where
you realize you may have\ndone something bad without.
And it's to do with\nthe kind of-- it's
to do with a weird combination\nof aesthetics, gestures,
references, and implications.
Collaborative work Lawrence\nWiener for a museum in Antwerp,
which involved making an entire\nfloor working with [inaudible]..
No other things, no\nother signage, nothing.
This is a big project.
I want to bring you to this\ncollaborative thing quickly.
In Arles in France, a\nshow that I put together
with Philippe Parreno called\nTo the Moon by the Beach,
where we imported 150\nlorry loads of sand
to the Roman arena.
And that's the final\nstate of the moon.
But basically we've started--
we based this\nprinciple on the idea
that it's always more\ninteresting to watch
other people working\nthan do it yourself.
So we had these sand geniuses\nfrom Holland come and work
all day, transforming the\nsand from a beach scape
to a moonscape, and\nnever stopping working.
And while they were\ndoing this, other artists
intervened and did\nthings around it.
Again, this secondary\nthing, this parallelism.
Here's work by Elvire Bonduelle,\na young French artist who
made these lunar material\naircraft, space material
umbrellas.
This work by Dominique\nGonzales-Foerster
that I didn't understand.
Work by Lawrence Wiener who\nkept saying that the thing--
I don't know if anyone's\ncome across him,
but is worth looking\ninto if you haven't.
He kept saying it's\nall about washers.
You know, like\neverything was about--
the whole world is held\ntogether by washers.
You know what I mean, the\nthings between a nut and a bolt?
And that's what you need\nto think about in the world
is washers.
So he made some.
And then we have\na space man who'd
walk around playing a harmonica.
And here you see them working.
And this is the work that\nwas the most notable there
by Pierre Huyghe\nwhere he paid an actor
to wear a rubber mask that it\nwas an exact copy of his head.
And then in bees would\nhive on his head every day.
And the man would walk\nout blinded by this
into the center of the arena\nuntil he fell to the ground
or fell to his knees.
And then quickly, the\nlast few slides just
to show that a certain kind of--
that in all these practices\nif you could say that there
are these things, right?
There's collaboration\nat one level.
There's a certain\nkind of commitment
to that kind of\nabstraction on another.
A desire to express\nsomething that's
hard to express through form.
A kind of muted form.
And then there's a kind\nof delicate interventions
and so on.
There are also these\nmoments of contradiction
that come out of other things.
And that's what I wanted\nto show you at the end.
So this is a one year show\nI did last year at the Museu
Serralves in Porto.
And it's a Caesar building,\na [inaudible] Ceasar
building from the 90s\nI think, or the 80s.
Kind of a great building,\nand they've restored it.
It had gotten tatty.
Because those buildings get--
southern European\nbuildings start
to look kind of ratty around\nthe edges quite quickly.
But they fixed it up again.
And I did a show there of\nthese works that are kind of--
can't be accounted for\nin my normal narrative.
So this is a piano that plays\nGrandola, Vila Morena, which
was the song that\nwas played to signal
the start of the Portuguese\nRevolution in '74.
Meanwhile black snow falls.
And it's me trying to\nremember the music,
trying to remember\nhow the song goes.
It's a very melancholic,\nevocative word.
But it comes from me saying\nto Phillipe Parreno years
ago when we didn't\nhave ideas, right--
and in film school\nyou could always
say if you have no ideas\nthere's always Tarkovsky, right?
In architecture school you could\nsay, well, there's always--
years ago maybe or even\nnow-- you could say, well,
there's always\n[inaudible],, right?
There's always something to\nfall back on, if in doubt.
To acquire taste and resonance\nand meaning and significance,
and even grand ambition.
With us we realized, maybe\nit's a piano and black snow.
This would carry enough\nin the art context.
Here's my first proposed\nart work, which brings me--
I'm trying to get to the end\nof my explaining everything.
The trick to this\napples and bears thing
is don't build a building.
Never try and build a building.
Artists who build\nbuildings are great,
and artists who build\ntheir own houses are great.
But artists who build other\nbuildings for other people,
I don't think, are that great.
And I've never-- in\nfact they can't do it.
It's not possible.
It's actually psychologically,\nphilosophically,
and conceptually incoherent.
Doesn't make any sense.
So this is a building\nthat I proposed in 1992
for the city of Milan\nfor a new public housing
project where they wanted\nan abstract public artwork.
And I realized they didn't.
What they needed was a\ncenter for young people.
And already at the age\nof 28 I was feeling
not that urgently young.
So I figured what I\nwould do is I'd propose
a center for young people.
There would be a free zone\nwhere no one can go in apart
from young people.
And I would seed this\nbuilding with the two
contradictory libidinous urges\nof the male psyche, which
is AC/DC and Joy Division.
The kind of crotch\nthrusting idiocy of AC/DC
and the shoegazing\nseriousness of Joy Division.
And by doing that, set up a\nimmediate argument that could
be overwritten and over scored.
They weren't interested.
They were so uninterested\nthey didn't even reply.
They didn't even respond.
It just got dropped completely.
From that point on, I\nnever proposed or built
or attempted to even\nthink about a building
ever again, which has been\nvery, very good for me.
And that's a model of it.
And here's a kind\nof Phantom model
of it combining these\ntwo contradictions, which
I think is rather\nbeautiful in its own way.
And here is a work which\nis a large version of--
Guy Debord, towards\nthe end of his life,
decided to mainly\nwork on war games.
And so this a large\nversion of a war game,
similar to one that he designed.
Just to show you how\nthis play with form
and touch and lightness and\ncollaboration has developed.
And then my last show,\njust now in Berlin,
which is modeled\non the apartment I
used to stay in in Vienna from\nmemory, s is a great street.
One of the greatest\nnamed streets
in the world, which is called\n[inaudible] and [inaudible]
which means kind of hit the sky\nor punch heaven or touch heaven
in a way, firmly.
Touch heaven firmly.
So I did this.
And it's basically my\ngraphic work, which I've--
I know it's an important part\nof what architecture students do
and art students--\nbut I realized
I had produced a lot of graphics\nand a lot of secondary work.
Which I-- a bit like the\nsign on a building, right,
the signage that tells you\nthe name of the building.
Is that like-- it's like that\ndirect engagement moment,
right?
Which I realized I'd\ntold more stories
through the secondary or\nthird level or fourth level
or fifth level minor\ngesture than I ever
did through a collaboration\nor the work or whatnot.
And that's the\nlast image of that.
This is sort of the end of part\n1 and 1/2, because we are--
I'm going to now--
I'm going to develop this a\nbit, but not for too long.
But I just show you this\nto give you an idea, right?
So we've seen these\nvarious things.
And I think this\nis always the thing
to look out for for yourself.
Because you realize\nthat you've--
so a magazine cover saying,\nwere people this dumb before TV?
A print for a Belgian\nguide that says tobac,
it's like a tobacco factory.
Different states of a public\nartwork for your tract.
A poster that I\ndid for a magazine.
A series of posters that\nI did for a magazine
in the Netherlands.
Another one here, Dear Editor.
A kind of plea.
A poster for a film that I made,\nabout a very short 1 and 1/2
minute film I made about the\nformer Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara.
A design for taxi\nI did in Vienna
that you can use as a\nruler or a measuring device
because it's broken down\ninto 10 centimeter things.
And this Mercedes used to\ndrive around Vienna as a taxi,
and he could use it to\nmeasure buildings with.
A public poster I did\nanonymously in Paris that got
put up all over the canal\non the way to Villette.
A print about speculation and\nplanning that you will find
very useful, any of you\nwho think about planning.
Because it just is states\nof speculation and planning
in percentile shifts\nwith no logical change.
So you get the idea.
Designed for a billboard, right?
A design for the Vietnam\nSaigon Biennale in maybe 2000
So you start to get a much\nbigger picture from here.
OK, so what we see seems to\nshow a lack of direction.
And I would argue\nthat's exactly right.
There is very little direction.
Things do not lead easily\nfrom one to the other.
There's some self-consciousness\nin all this work.
There's some-- things are\nderived from, but not a lot.
A lot of it's to do with play.
It's to do with suburban\nupbringing and whatnot.
There's very little citation\nin the work of other things,
right?
There's a lot of response,\ncall it response.
The artist is a useful person.
A useful person that can provide\nthese things that cannot be
quite touched, or you can't\nquite put your finger on.
What it is is this\nquality of being
in the world that isn't quite--
you can't quite do\nit in other things.
So coming back to the\nHome Office building,
this ability to\nplay with the facade
and designate that\nas an artwork changes
the relationship and\nthe way the architect
can work in relation to\nthe client and the city
and designation in\na different way.
But it's a very\nsoft, subtle thing.
What I noticed, though,\nin the last few years
is something that's always been\nthere, which is an increasing
rupture in the art context.
An increasing rupture\nbetween the people
who are interested, in a sense,\nin context, in organization,
in art as a kind of place\nwithin which to do--
in which to agitate\nat one level.
But also in which to come up\nwith a replacement for what
they strongly\nbelieve is a failure
on the part of architects,\nplanners, urbanists, especially
politicians more so.
To actually provide human spaces\nthat are not just smoothly
glossed over by\na neoliberal kind
of wash of, like,\nsome nice landscaping
and some gentrification.
So you have quite profoundly\nagitating structures
in the art world, which\nare very in parallel
to the agitating ones within\nthe edge of architecture
and planning.
They often crossover.
You get the same theorists\ntalking to both sets of people.
This clearly creates a rupture.
And those people are\noften completely against,
or uninterested in anything that\ncould pass for a discreet art
object, right, the historical\nart object, the late modern art
object.
In the same way that\nyou have architects
and architectural\ntheorist who would say,
we are completely\ndisinterested in anything that
constitutes a built practice.
And these discussions,\nof course,
were circling around\nthe AA and places
like that before\nwhen I was in my--
you know, I was just an idea.
So what's happened\nis there's a kind
of strange convergence at\none level, of an attempt
to be outside, right?
And at the same time, a kind\nof increase in the idea--
with the rise of contemporary\nart history as a discipline--
the rise in the\nidea that you can
talk about there having been\nan origin of contemporary art.
This is the reason I wrote the\nbook Industry in Intelligence.
Because I wanted to\nlook at this rupture.
Like, this schism in\nart has become as deep
as the Reformation or something.
It's as extreme.
There are people that\nI know, have worked
with for nearly 20 years now,\nwho would never, ever set foot
in a private gallery\nor the Tate gallery
or the Museum of Modern\nArt, because it is not
a repository of anything\nthey recognize as interesting
or as art.
OK, they might sneak in to\nthe last day of a [inaudible]
show or a [inaudible] show.
But generally speaking they\nsteer clear of these places
completely.
On the other hand, you\ncan get a very elevated--
almost catchy in a sense--\nkind of formalist way
that you can find exemplified\naround some press releases
now, right?
So you could talk about a\nyoung painted dude, right,
and he's doing his\npaintings, which
looked like a kind\nof race to the bottom
to see who can do the\nmost slack painting.
And the press release\nwill say something like--
let's call him Josh\nVanderbilt. Josh Vanderbilt
interrogates his\nown subjectivity
while probing at historical\nmodes of painting as a form.
And this is great.
I mean, I agree this is a\nvery sophisticated practice
probably.
But it's a very\nparticular one, right?
And it very much signals things.
It signals a certain\nkind of affiliation
or a set of\nconnections or desires.
So what you've got\nright now is something
that's happened over the\nyears at different moments
in architecture and\nvarious other fields,
but just at different times.
It just happens to be\nhappening right now.
So what I wanted to--
however what happens,\nbecause contemporary art's
the longest--
I'm kind of going to\nwind this up really,
because we can talk about it\nin a more conversational way.
However far you try\nand step outside,
unlike architecture\nwhere I think
there were moments where you\ncould step outside and say,
I'm now a theorist or\nI'm a paper architect.
Or, I'm not even an architect,\nI think about human relations.
Or, I know what I am.
I'm just another\ntype of human being.
The art world-- because of it's\nvery particular relationship
to capitalism, and it's\nparticular relationship
to exchange--
tends to be able to absorb\nwhat tries to step outside it.
So a good example--
and I have to go\nbackwards, because, like,
this is what happens because\nI'm not a specialist.
OK, it's clear that\ncertain attempts
to step outside the current\ndiscourse in architecture
are partly the nature\nof architecture itself.
That's partly what\none is studying.
At the same time it's--
while things do leak into\nkind of the built mainstream,
it happens through\ncertain figures
or through certain\npeople carrying that,
or it leaks in and kind\nof secretes itself.
What happens in the art world--
to a certain extent--
is these contradictory\nor broken kind of sides
can all be absorbed\nwithin the art world,
within the art context,\nwithin the art market even.
So however hard you\ntry and step outside,
you can be absorbed within it.
And this is a really--
it's quite close to what we all\nthink about art historically,
but it's particularly\nstrong now.
So I tried to write\na book about what
are the technical and geological\nand historical political
reasons why we have this thing\ncalled contemporary art, which
has been the longest lasting--
in a sense, if you exclude like\na phrase like the Renaissance,
which obviously is kind\nof idiotic to think.
I'm talking about\npost time 1900.
Contemporary art's\nlasted the longest
because it's the one\nthing it's not a self--
no one calls themself a\ncontemporary artist anymore.
I'm not sure anyone says\ncontemporary architect, either.
But it's a description\nof a kind of thing
that you kind of\nknow what it is.
You can smell it and taste\nit, but it's not a movement.
It's a kind of\ntemporal descriptor
that will do to\nencompass anything.
It's an amoebic thing that\ncan keep growing and absorbing
things.
And I wanted to\nlook at what were
the historical technical\nconditions that
allowed that to happen.
How did that happen?
Even in the face of [inaudible].
Even in the face of-- or maybe\nhe's the fault, in fact--
but in the face of robust\ncriticism, robust self-
consciousness, how\ndoes that happen?
So just to-- because I think\nif people have questions
we could do that.
So I'll just give you\na quick indication
of some of the chapter\nheadings, because it tells you--
it sums up everything.
Then we could have questions.
So contemporary art\ndoes not account
for that which has is\nplacing It's very true.
I spend my time with people\nwho don't make any work.
Would never-- they'd\nrather be shot.
They'd rather have their\nface eaten by weasels
than make anything\nresembling anything.
But not only that,\nthey don't consider
hanging around and having\ntea, or doing nothing
to be doing work either.
They are outside.
There's a new community\nof critical consciousness
that is used as a\nkind of art umbrella
under which to operate.
It's a kind of useful umbrella.
So contemporary art\ndoes not account
for that which is taking place.
Protection and\nparallelism, these
are the two things that are\nthe most profound things,
in my opinion, that allow\ncontemporary art to retain
this kind of strange position.
It projects towards something.
It's constantly heading for\nsomething just out of reach,
and it's inherently parallel.
It's always in parallel.
I can never get blamed for\nthe sins of an architect,
because I work in\nparallel to them.
I never am taking on\ntheir responsibilities.
Then I dealt with\nfour specific dates
that I won't go into detail\nabout, because it's too long.
But I-- there's also\nsomething temporal here
about ASAP future,\nnot infinite future.
So art became more and\nmore closer to the present,
like the way developed\ncapitalism became
better and better at\ncapitalizing on the recent past
and the near future.
Are also came closer and\ncloser to the present.
It was one of the things\nthat could do that.
Abstract, you have to\ntalk about the endurance
of the idea of a kind of\nabstraction as a mark of art.
The complete curator,\nwhich is a text I
wrote which is in the\nbook about the idea
of the curator as a figure.
And this should never\nbe underestimated.
Every time you see a dopey book\nor a stupid article or a thing
online about curating yourself--\nor even Hans-Ulrich's book
about curating--
it's hard to underestimate what\nthe complete curator means,
and how it changed everything.
The arrival of the curatorial\nvoice, or their demands.
The ethical demands\nof advanced curators
now run so far in\nadvance of art itself
that it's impossible\nfor any artist
to possibly keep up\nwith that demand, right?
So you get-- all\nyou have to do is
study, for example,\nthe last documenter
to find an example of that.
The return of the border,\nwhich of course in art
is very important.
A good example is\nWillem de Kooning
came to America whenever,\n1946 or something,
and is thought of as an American\npainter within about 18 months,
as far as I can make out.
I moved here 20 years ago, and\nI'm quite rightly a British--
in a way British--
and with a bit of Irish\nthrown in-- artist.
Now, that's very important.
Because it's important--\nbecause for many people
it's important to know where\nyou came from and who you are
and where you stand, right?
And the world worked very well\nfor male artists in America
at that point in the late 40s.
So of course de Kooning\nbecame one of the guys.
He became an American\nartist, and he
stated that he was\nan American artist
with his heavy Dutch accent.
I'm doomed.
I will never be an\nAmerican artist,
like I'm not the German artist.
That's why I could do the German\npavilion, because I'm not one
and I can't be one.
I'm kind of stuck.
But the return of the\nborder, ironically, you know,
it's an issue that\nwe can all discuss.
OK, the last three are\nthe experimental factory.
The idea that art can give\nus experimental models is,
in a way--
or the gap between the idea\nthat contemporary art can
gave us an experimental or\na living model of practice.
And the reality\nof art is actually
a withdrawn melancholic\nand self-loathing practice,
is what's really\ninteresting to me.
That's what I look\nat in that chapter.
Nostalgia for the group.
The relationship between the\nindividual and the group.
This is something I came to\nthe [inaudible] opening night
on Friday--
Thursday-- which was ostensibly\nabout management and models
of work and how partnerships\nand things are done.
What you find is that this is\na very coherent and stated--
it's very--
it's structurally part of\narchitectural practice.
Within art, all\ninteresting moments
start as a group, right?
Because you're a bunch\nof undefinable people
of a generation,\nmaybe from a place.
They then become more refined\nand more discriminating
and more broken down.
And then when things return\nor become interesting again,
such as the pictures\ngeneration in New York,
it starts to become\na group again.
Now this also happens\nin other fields
like literature,\narchitecture, and music.
It's particularly strong\nin contemporary art,
this idea of nostalgia\nfor the group.
And it's partly to do with\ncuratorial and critical
approaches.
Because it becomes\ninteresting if you
start to understand the group--
again the nostalgia\nfor the group--
you can return to the group\nand find the people that
were excluded from the group.
And this I look at\nalso in the book.
And finally, the final\nchapter is called, why work?
Which is really a\nquestion trying to-- it's
really a section trying\nto address the accusation.
The artists are the ultimate\nfreelance knowledge workers,
that they are really\nthe guilty ones.
That they're the ones that have\nbeen responsible for creating
a model of existence\nthat has dragged us
into this kind of relativistic\nrenovated kind of nowhere,
dystopia.
The cappuccino-ization\nof all moments of life.
And I kind of refute this.
I dismiss this\naccusation, in a sense.
But I do it as a\nmatter of principle
rather than really\nbeing able to do it.
But I think you'd have to read\nPierre Bourdieu to really get
further than that on that one.
I think it's already\nbeen covered, in a way.
So I would ask if there\nare any questions.
And it's always a tricky one.
I don't know if you want to\ncome and help mediate that.
So, Liam, thank you very much.
Really-- [applause] You've left\nus with a lot of questions,
a lot of issues.
I know there are quite a few\npeople who would like to--
or I hope that they will\nengage you-- in conversation.
Just to push you a little bit\nabout sort of apples and bears.
Because I think--
I mean, maybe this\nis very unfair.
But, I mean, on one\nlevel you are the artist,
you are the curator,\nyou are the critic,
and you kind of do all of\nthose things simultaneously.
I suppose part of it--\nin terms of the book--
is to ask to what end.
In the sense, what's\nthe purpose of the book?
To construct a new artist?
To develop a criticism\nof contemporary art?
You know, so what\nis the relationship
between the\nproduction of the book
and really the status of the\nartist and how it helps you?
So one question relates to that.
But more specifically on\nthis apples and bears.
I mean, I feel\nlike, OK, when you
are doing pieces that resembles\ncertain kinds of design
activity, assembly of things, a\ncolor juxtaposition of things,
installation of elements,\nthat could be at once thought
to be the model of something.
But yet they're not.
That's fine.
But when you start collaborating\nwith Terry Farrell,
and you make part of a\nfacade of a building.
And you then say,\nwell, I'm the bear
or I'm the apple, whatever.
But, I mean, I think\nmy question to you
is at that at that moment\nthere is a level of complicity
in the work where you\ncan no longer claim to be
the artist so independently.
Even though it may be\nthat from the perspective
of the UK\ngovernment's, you know,
designation of the difference\nbetween architecture and art,
the piece can be protected.
But to a passerby who is\nassessing and perceiving
that building, that\ncould also easily
be seen as ornament,\nfor example.
And so I'm just\ntrying to figure out
how you can participate to\nthat degree in the fabrication
of a piece of architecture,\nand at the same time claim
a kind of innocence, which\nyou try to do to some degree.
So--
Yeah.
It's a good question.
But it cuts to\nthe heart of the--
what I try and get\nto it in the book.
Which is it's-- none of these\nthings are a problem for me
in a sense.
When you said, well, it\ncan become like ornament,
for example, or it can\nbecome like sort of--
maybe even go further and say\nkind of an attractive design
solution that sort of\ngets around the problem
of a slightly clumsily\nexecuted attempt
to do kind of a\ncertain form of--
a certain kind of\naesthetic that we
can recognize in that building\nwith the [? louvers ?]
and the different components,\nthe different forms.
And I would say, yes,\nthey're exactly the things.
And the two ways I would look\nat it, especially as a student.
I was still taught--
and this is where it comes down\nto some of these differences
are about teaching.
We still have Legacy\nGreenberg teachers,
meaning a few grumpy men\nwho were abstract painters.
And they believed in muscular\npainting, whatever that meant.
And they believed in\nthe idea of truth.
Truth to materials, truth--
truthiness in the\nway of addressing
in a muscular way, the push\nand pull of the painting
or something.
And this, for them, was\nkind of outside the concerns
of everyone else,\noutside the mess of life.
And it did, of course, create\nextraordinary moments in art.
It was also funded by\nthe CIA-- a lot of it--
and especially the talking\nabout it and the showing of it.
And it was also very male\nin a very straight, male way
and with some exceptions, good\nexceptions like Grace Hartigan,
and other artists who were\nvery good and interesting.
The point is that they used\nwhat struck me in the mid 80s
as very gendered accusations.
So if I was very interested in--
like my-- if we\ngo-- well, we won't.
The first thing-- the tea\ntray with the colors on it--
which now suddenly makes sense,\nthe portrait of Adi Dessler.
I was told this was\ndesignee inductive
by one of these grumpy old\nmen who then just stomped off
to go to the pub.
And I thought, yes, it is,\nand it's deliberately so.
And I wanted to be involved\nin this world of, in a sense,
lures.
Using things as lures, and using\nthings as secondary things.
Mainly what happens in\nthat home office building
is I replace materials.
It's a very kind of\npostmodern thing to do.
I kind of look at what we\ncan do with the glazing,
and I go to the factory\nin [? tour ?] in France,
to [inaudible]\n[inaudible] or whatever--
and see if I can\ntalk them into doing
a fritting on the glass\nfor the same price
as just making the glass.
So I become--
I use what artists\nare really good at,
which is being just you, with\nanother person or a few people.
And trying to talk them\ninto doing something,
or try to get something done.
So it's all about role\nplaying, yes, I agree with you.
It's about role playing.
It's about complicity.
Everything for me is\nabout implication.
I wrote a text once called\nThe Implicated Player, which
is about this idea of the\nartist is the implicated figure.
And that's really what a\nlot of the book's about,
is about the history of how\ndid we get to this point?
Well, it's because we have the\nright conditions in society
to produce this kind of figure\nof the contemporary artist who
is, in a sense, this\nimplicated player.
And it won't be\nlike that forever,
but it's like it\nfor a brief while.
They represent something.
But part of that comes\nthrough technology
and through the\napparatus as much
as it comes through\ntheory and [inaudible]
and the rise of Western\nMarxism and the desire
to be in a subcultural\nframe and things like that.
None of those things\nare enough to explain
why we have these odd figures\naround who are supposed
to fulfill certain roles.
So maybe other\npeople will comment.
But, I mean, that's\nwhy I wanted to mention
the book and the role of\nwriting and criticism.
Because in some\nways, I'm wondering
what your reaction is to the\nfact that in some sense then
I could say--
again maybe this is not fair--
then why are you so insistent\nin controlling the reading
of the work?
Because by being both the artist\nand the critic simultaneously,
in some way there is a sense\nthat the reception of the work
is also something that you seem\nquite intent in being part of.
And so, like, what is the role\nof the thing, the person who is
not so familiar with the work?
Because part of your work\nrelies on a kind of knowing.
And it seems like nobody\nknows it as well as you do,
to some degree.
Right.
So that bit is sort of like--
I'm curious about\nthat involvement.
But we have other\nartists in the room here
who I've always been a fan\nof who've also written,
and have a tradition of writing.
And I was always drawn to\nartists who try and either make
an account of themselves, or\nthe conditions under which they
attempt to produce work.
And I try to do my\nversion of that.
For a period which is now\nincreasingly under scrutiny--
certainly in academic writing--
in sociology primarily,\nwhich is around
the formation of the\nperiod in the 90s,
and the rise of\nthe new third way.
The collapse of\nsocial democracy,
in a way, in\nEurope, which is now
leading that\ncollapse via the rise
of the Third Way, Tony\nBlair and a new kind
of attitude towards the\nrole of culture in society
and what it should do.
Access, engagement, what\nare the other words?
Because this is our time, right?
These good things-- and\nhow they are affected
and an understanding of the role\nof art and culture in society--
a lot of my work\nis deeply embedded.
This is a better\ntype of tea tray
that is a picture of someone\nwho ended up making shoes
that you wear to signify how\nmuch leisure you're having,
and how specialized the leisure\nit is that you're having.
And this is from 1987, right?
So you've got to think what,\nelse is being made in 1987?
And certainly--\naround in England--
no one's making a portray\nof Adi Dessler, which
is a kind of corrupted\nMondrian done
in kind of contemporary\nsportswear colors
on a tea tray.
So my writing is\nnot necessarily--
I'm not trying to write\nabout my own work.
I'm often writing\nabout other artists,
as Steven's done and other\npeople in the room have done.
In my book I'm trying to\nwrite an account of my--
what I see, right?
So any-- Please.
There's the mic that\nI think is going to--
Hi.
Hi.
May be a very silly\nquestion, but I just
wonder why are you feeling the\ncounters of the [inaudible]
phases every now and then?
Yes.
I don't know if anyone's\nfamiliar with an open sourced
software called Blender.
And Blender is often\nthe gateway 3D software
for people who don't\nhave money and they
don't have access to art\nschool or architecture school
facilities.
And it's actually kind\nof interesting, Blender.
Because it's-- like a lot\nof open sourced software--
it's a little tricky.
The interface it's a bit like--
I mean they all are, right?
But you don't get--\nit's a hard one.
But I've used Blender\nnow on and off for years,
because it keeps\ngetting improved,
like all open sourced software.
And once you work\nout the kinks in it
you can get things done\nin it that you can't quite
do in CAD and in the other\nones that are more proprietary.
Also it doesn't catastrophic\nthe update itself
in ways that become annoying.
It sort of just\ngradually changes.
So in-- there's two reasons.
It's hard for me to\ngive short answers.
But the first reason is if you\ngrew up in the 1970s before
the internet-- and when there\nwas only three channels on TV,
and most of them weren't\non most of the time--
I spent a lot of\ntime in the kitchen
filling in the Ds and the As and\nthe Os in my dad's newspaper,
because I was so\nbored in the suburbs.
That I had--
I just remember\ndoing that a lot.
And I did it in books\nwhole books, whole books
that I would do that to.
And on the other hand, Blender--
when I would start to work\nwith Blender-- was very bad.
When you turned the\ntypeface into a mesh,
it would tend to fill in the--
an extruder a little bit.
It would tend to fill them in.
And it was incredible pain in\nthe arse to get rid of them
all by triangulating the\nmesh and trying to pick them
all out one by one.
So I decided instead\nof fixing the problem--
which is a very particular\nway of doing it--
I thought I would instead\nin a font building program
make my own version\nof Helvetica that
had filled in-- some\nfilled in characters,
and you could also randomize it.
And so that's the answer.
So it's this kind of\nclassical combination.
Hello.
I was kind of interested\nin what you're
talking about in\nterms of implications
and being complicit.
And, I mean, you talk about\nyour work as very contextual.
Like it's always like, OK,\nwhat was happening in 1987
or what was happening then.
And you can try to\ncapture that instant.
And I would say that, like,\narchitects and designers also
draw upon these sort of\ncultural implications,
and try to bring\nthat into their work.
And it's like--
I guess I'm wondering like how\ndo you shape your work based
off of these contractual--
you know these cultural\ncontexts and things like that?
No, I agree.
I don't really do research.
I found there was a point\nwhen art became more serious.
And some people\nin the room would
have recognized this, too.
Where you'd arrive\nsomewhere to do a show--
to do something--\nto do an exhibition
or to make some work.
And people would say, oh,\nare you here researching?
And you'd think, where did\nthis word suddenly come from?
Why am I-- I'm just\nactually just in Milan.
And I will make an exhibition\nof what I want to make,
not researching.
But what's happened\nis partly the--
it's slightly the\nWikipediaization of things.
In the sense that things have\nto have a paper trail, right?
Or they have to-- you have to\nbe able to prove that they--
to a certain extent.
More and more there's a lot\nof highly interesting artists
where you need to be able to\nwork out where it comes from.
It leaves a paper trail, right?
As if there's a simple rift in\nart between a kind of Dionysian
figure on one hand who randomly\njust kind of does this,
and then the people who have\ndouble checked everything.
In fact, life's much more\ncomplicated, much more.
And art's more\ncomplicated than that.
All I would say about\nwhat you are asking
is that I'm not\nresearching, right?
So I'm not going\nto look at the way
that tower, the terrible\ntragedy of that tower,
the Grenfell Tower in England.
That's right-- I know\nthat area really well.
And I remember them\ndoing that kind of thing.
My work-- a lot of it--\nrefers to this process
of manic renovation\nand [inaudible]
that started to take place in\nthe 80s and 90s and onwards.
THAT attempted to give\na new kind of sheen
to these brutalist buildings\nand these apparently
failed buildings.
That instead of\nknocking them down,
you could rebrand\nthem with aesthetics,
right, a certain aesthetic.
And it was done,\nof course, with a--
what do you call it--\nlike a sprinkling
of ecological consciousness.
Because it was also supposed\nto make them better buildings.
They would now be\nwarmer, insulated.
I think they were probably\ndone with good intentions.
So what I'm trying to say is\nthat when I mentioned Carl
Andre, Carl Andre claims his\nminimalist art from the 60s
is influenced by seeing the\ntruth of materials sitting
as they fell, laid,\nwere laid down
on the ground in the\nrail yards of Quincy.
My work is made under\nconditions of having emerged
at a period when people were\n[inaudible] things, rebranding
them.
Arthur Andersen and Co.
Accountants becomes\nlike [inaudible]
or [inaudible] or something.
Everything-- or [inaudible]\nis Philip Morris, right?
Isn't it, or something?
Things start to get these\nweird medical sounding names.
I mean, you've grown up with all\nof this, it's kind of normal.
But I watched that moment of\nturning from this to this.
And as a suburban\nperson brought up
bored shitless right near\nwhere George Micheal is from,
that's exactly where I'm from.
And he killed himself.
You know what his boyfriend\nsaid he died from?
He just wore himself out.
His body just gave out.
And I know exactly\nwhat he means.
We're the same age.
And I grew up in that\narea, and it was so boring.
All you could do is think of\nnew ways to wear out your body,
because there was\nnothing else, in the way.
And I'm a product of\nthe suburbs in the 70s.
And I have a combination of\ndelusion and distraction,
right?
So I didn't have a vision.
Other people I went\nto college with
were interested in sex or death.
Other people were talented.
Other people were even a genius.
Some people couldn't\nhelp themselves,
they just had to\ndo doors all day.
Other people had a\npolitical consciousness that
was so more elevated than mine.
And it wasn't until I read--
which is always good--
like Pierre Bourdieu or\n[inaudible] or Foucault--
weirdly enough--
more than anything\nthat I started
to realize that\nthere was a kind of--
there was something in\nthis condition that I had,
or this condition of origin or\nthis beginning point, right?
And this could be\nthe subject, the work
that I heard move into.
I could-- this sense of\ndelusion and distraction
could be the thing.
It kind of half\nanswers your question.
I don't live in a\nworld where people
like me are the only\npeople making work.
This would be very, very bad.
But there's-- I realized after\n25 years there was something
that I had seen, I think, that--
when I saw that tower on\nfire I went really cold.
Because it's such a\ngraphic representation
of a misplaced gesture towards\nthe transfer of aesthetics
over a kind of reality, right?
That that's very, very\ncomplicated and, you know,
hasn't been worked out.
And you are the generation\nwho needs to-- in a sense,
there's suddenly\nthis big, in a sense,
project to think about\nthese relationships
again without using\nthe old terms.
Like the old men who would\ncome up to me and say,
well, this is not true.
Like, what you're\ndoing is a lie.
It's decorative and designy.
And somehow there's\nsomething in here.
So the book is catastrophically\nself-absorbed at times,
and doesn't have many\npoints of reference
or very-- you can't verify it.
But there's-- it's\na [inaudible]..
It's got bits and pieces\nin it that if-- there's
some lines in it that\nare good, I think.
But there's something in here.
And I don't go on\ntoo long because--
but I'll give a good\nreason why I did it.
OK, I'll tell you the truth,\nbecause I now have a beard,
and I'm a man.
I'll tell you what happened, OK.
The reason why I really did it.
Because I don't do any studio\nteaching anymore, but I do
keep in touch with a much\nmore important group of people
than artist, which is curators.
So I go and do--
I'm on the graduate committee\nat Bard College, which
was one of the first curatorial\nstudies programs in the world.
So it's very good,\nand very interesting.
And all the people who go to\nit kind of hate each other.
It is a competitive\nenvironment and it's curating
and it's very fraught.
And I realize they--
I don't really teach but they--
I realized that they asked\nme would I do for a class.
And I thought--
I realized what\nthey didn't do is
they didn't do a class on\ncontemporary art, which
I thought was really funny\nfor a curatorial program.
There must have been examples\nof architecture schools
where they didn't actually teach\nthe history of architecture,
of course.
But-- Yeah.
but I thought it\nwas kind of cool.
So I thought I'd invite\nall the people I respected
as new generation contemporary\nart historians to come
to Bard to talk to us about the\norigins of contemporary art,
like, where it comes from.
And the thing is I didn't tell--
most them were too busy, but\nthen I've got a lot of money
so I could pay\nthem really well--
so I didn't tell them that I\nhad invited the other ones.
So for eight weeks--
one went one week\nafter the other--
a fairly distinguished\nperson like Alex Albero or I
don't know--
a bunch of people, OK,\nreally good people--
and explained what the origins\nof contemporary art were.
And what was really interesting\nis at least five of the eight
said the same thing.
And I didn't actually\nknow this was true.
I didn't realize it, the\norigin of contemporary art
is John Cage talking\nto the art historians--
something in\nPasadena, and someone
talking somewhere in\nCalifornia 1957 or something.
I mean, John Cage--
I was around in the 80s and 70s.
John Cage is actually the--
I never heard his name\nmentioned once until--
I mean, he is an\nimportant figure,
but this was never discussed.
His name had never\ncome up before.
So this is a new--
I don't want to get argued with,\nbut this is relatively new.
The idea that John\nCage is the origin,
in a sense, of contemporary\nart, this is a kind of new one.
So the students got\nreally irritated.
Because it's a bit like\nif you're coming here
and you waste your time.
One week you have someone\ncoming in and saying, well,
you know modern architecture\nstarts with this.
And then the next week another\nperson comes and they sort of
say the same thing.
It was sort of\nirritating for people.
So I asked the students if they\ncould come up with a better
term than contemporary art.
Because what's happening\nis these people
are professors of\ncontemporary art history,
so they have to think\nabout where it comes from,
otherwise they're kind of stuck.
So if we can think of another\nterm, we can move ahead of them
and save contemporary art\nand keep the amoeba growing
and keep including\nmore and more things
in a kind of cynical way.
Now, that's quite difficult\nand quite dangerous.
So no one did anything.
So none of the students\ncame up with a better term.
So I gave them all a\nC, because that was
the only thing they had to do.
And I got this call\nfrom Tom Eccles,
who's the head of Bard\nCollege and the Museum Exec.
You can't give them\na C. You can't do it.
It's going to cause chaos.
People are going to fail.
And I said, OK.
I said-- this the end of\nthe talk, by the way--
I said, OK, give them all\nan A. They've got to go
on a cross-country run, and\nthen they can all get an A.
And I don't--
I just want to\nsee one photograph
of one person looking as if they\ncould go on a cross-country run
if they felt like it.
And I never got that photograph,\nand I gave them all an A
anyway.
And that's the end of my story.
That's will be in volume two.
Thank you.
Thank you very much\nfore listening.
Thank you.
We could.
But, you know, I'm just trying\nto stick to the schedule.
Well, we'll do it after.
No, no, no.
Well, we could.
We'll do it afterwards.
Anyway, thank you all very much.
I was hoping that we\nwould engage more of you
in a conversation.
But maybe we can\ndo it informally.
Anyway, thank you so much,\nLiam, this was great.
I know that this is an\nongoing conversation.
So we will continue to\nhave this conversation.
You have the mic\nready, rearing to go.
But come and talk\nto Liam down here.
Thank you again very much.
Thank you.
Sorry, I'm bad--
