Good evening.
Thank you so much\neveryone for coming out.
We're actually very excited\nabout the exhibition
and about this opening tonight.
And maybe even a little nervous.
I'm Michael Hays if\nthere are visitors here
and don't know that.
I'm joined by Andrew Holder.
We co-curated the\nexhibition outside,
and we'll try to go some way\ntoward explaining it tonight.
I really do think if we can\ncome across and get some
of this explanation, you'll\nsee that the show is actually
quite a lot of fun and merits\na lot meditation, and study,
and returning to.
We hope tonight, which is\nreally just the opening
of the exhibition, will not come\noff like a formal presentation.
We really want this\nto be a conversation.
I think we're going to\ntry very hard to leave
enough time for a conversation\nwith the audience.
Questions, answers, comments.
Because one of the things that\nwe've tried to do in the school
lately very much is to have\na public discourse that
continues in the\nhallways, in the studios,
as well as in the classrooms.
And we very much\nsee this exhibition
as part of providing\nmaterial that
helps establish that discourse.
We hope that through\ngallery talks,
maybe with some of the\nfaculty, we can actually
use it to continue those.
But first, we owe a lot of\nthanks I'll ask Andrew to give.
Yes.
Michael and I are\ndeeply indebted,
and there are a couple\nof people that we would
like to acknowledge publicly.
So first and foremost, our sort\nof dual patrons, MOS and Pat.
Thank you for your\nsupport of the exhibition
and for your leadership.
And please forgive us\nwhen the bill arrives.
[laughter]
We would also like to add\nto our list of patrons.
Both Ken and Paige in\nthe communications office
have been indispensable.
And, of course, also Dan Borelli\nand David Zimmerman-Stuart,
who lead the exhibitions team.
And they wrought miracles along\nwith their team of installers
and did some really\nbrilliant work.
So our heartfelt thanks.
There were a great\nnumber of students
involved in the\nproduction of the show,
perhaps too many\nto call out singly.
But I would like to identify\nthree in particular from three
different programs\nhere at the GSD.
First, Mindy Hsu,\nwho is a current MDes
student who is absolutely\ninstrumental to the exhibition
design.
Christina Shivers, a\ndoctoral candidate,
helped to orchestrate all of the\nlogistics of getting this work
here, which was no small task.
Adam Strobel, who\nis an MArch student.
And we'll just call him our\ntireless jack of all trades.
He sort of had his fingers in\neverything and did brilliantly.
With those thanks,\nwe should also
emphasize the kind of\nenormity of the task.
So there are more\nthan 70 practices
on display in the\nhallway outside,
many of them originating\nhere at the GSD.
We have nearly 400 drawings\nand images and 26-ish models
if one of them made it through\ncustoms this afternoon.
And all of that was\nbrought together
in a span of about\n45 days by this team.
So once again, thank you.
"It need scarcely be said\nthat an epitaph presupposes
a monument upon which\nit is to be engraved."
This is the opening sentence\nof Wordsworth's longest
critical text which is\npart prose, part poetry,
but it's actually made to be a\nkind of theoretical text called
Essays Upon Epitaphs.
This is 1810.
When you come in and see the\nmain introductory wall text,
this is the first\nthing that appears.
And for us, it's\nan inaugural case
of the concept of\ninscription, which
I want to unpack a little bit.
Notice that the word\nmonument, which is, of course,
for us architecture\nof a certain sort,
it has a flatly literal meaning.
It's devoid of any\nattribution of value.
This is not the great monument\nfull of content and grandeur
that is great because of\nits meaning or its content.
It's rather a fairly\ninert material object
that provides a surface for\nmarking, for the epitaph.
It does not have\nany meaning in it.
Now this, of course,\nis a departure
for an object of art, whose\nartistic nature would usually
be thought of as a function\nof its form being transformed
into some clear\nrepresentational content.
And it's that departure\nthat interests us.
At the same time,\nWordsworth makes monument
mean the material element,\nthe sort of culturally
shared reading apparatus\nthat the epitaph presupposes.
This culturally shared\nreading apparatus
has to already be in place if\nthe epitaph, if the speech,
the text is going\nto have any effect.
The monument is a prior\ncondition for a text to come.
This restrictive use\nof the word monument
is actually really\nimportant for us.
It marks an attention,\nfirst of all,
to a culturally specific\nmedium and yet, the medium
is not semantic.
It's blank.
It doesn't have\nimminent meaning.
It is attention to an\nexpression yet to come.
But at the same time, it\ninsist that the material will
impinge upon that expression.
The epitaph itself, the\nmark, cannot exist without
the architecture.
And it's for this\nreason partly--
So the use of the\nword presuppose
that means this precondition\nthat already exists, perhaps
like in a virtual dimension.
Architecture seems\nto be already there
before the epitaph speaks.
And it's for\npartially this reason
that the subtitle\nArchitecture Before
Speech that we use for the\nshow, for the exhibition,
came partially from this\nWordsworth quotation.
So what we're\ngoing to do tonight
is to try to make sense of\nthis notion of inscription,
but do it by mapping on\nthis kind of definition
onto the four categories in the\nentire field of the exhibition.
And we're going to do\nthis by sort of going back
and forth a couple of times.
I'll first comment a little\nfurther on the background
of the concept of\ninscription, then
Andrew will talk about the\nfield of work that we draw from.
And I just want to point out\nit's extremely important for us
that a lot of this work\ncomes from the faculty
of the Graduate School\nof Design because--
and this is just\nfor the family--
let's say part of our\nclaim is that not only are
we part of this\nlarger discourse,
but we're actually an\nimportant driving part of it.
And it's important for\nus that that's the case.
So Andrew will talk\nabout that feel.
And then I'll come\nback and focus--
you'll see a couple\nof diagrams out there.
One is a very important\nquadripartite diagram
where we try to show the\nrelationship, or signal
relationship, between\nthe four categories.
And our claim is going to be\nthat these four categories are
not arbitrary.
They're actually\nlogically related.
And that's what\nI'll try to explain.
And then Andrew will\ncome back finally
to talk about the\neffects and affects
that are sponsored by the works.
I think we're going to\ninterrupt each other.
I think we would like to\nhave those interruptions be
productive and lead to a\nmore informal conversation
that we'd like to continue.
So I'll get on with\nthat so we have time.
The intellectual\nethos of the work
that we're presenting in the\nexhibition we want to suggest
actually derives from the\nprofound cultural shifts
not in the 1990s, but in\nthe mid to late 1960s.
And we're not claiming that\nthere's any direct relationship
between the work\nand the ethos that I
want to show the\nbackground of, but rather
that the architecture that\ndid evolve from this discourse
went a different direction.
And now what we see\nis an architecture
returning, not intentionally,\nbut returning nevertheless,
to a discourse that\nstarted in the '60s.
There are two discourses.
One is the architectural\ndiscourse itself,
which I'm actually not\ngoing to talk about,
but it would involve people\nas diverse as Archizoom,
early, early OMA, and Ungers,\nVenturi, and Ghery, Rossi.
It would involve\nthose kinds of people.
And Eisenman.
And Eisenman.
For sure.
For sure.
We'll do that in a class.
But the other that I\ndo want to talk about
because I think it's\nless familiar, is
the shift from\nstructuralist thought--
Levi Strauss and others--
which was largely\ndescriptive and synchronic,
to post-structuralist\nthought, which was historical.
And it's that historicity,\nthat attention to historical,
that will be important for us.
But actually I'm going to\ndemonstrate both discourses
in a single example.
And it starts with Tony\nSmith, who in 1966 recounted
the dark night in 1951\nwhen Smith found himself
in a car with three\nstudents from Cooper Union,
driving illegally down the not\nyet opened New Jersey Turnpike.
He talks about there\nwere no street lamps,
there were no lane\nmarkers or guardrails.
So this photograph I'm using\nis actually taken later.
They relied on their\nheadlights, but also he
says on the industrial glow of\nthe landscape of North Jersey.
And in a now famous Artforum\nform interview in '66,
he described the drive as\na revelation about art.
He says, "The road and much of\nthe landscape was artificial,
and yet it couldn\'t be\ncalled a work of art."
And it's interesting\nthis word artificial.
Artifice will also become\nan important concept for us.
"On the other hand," he said,\n"it did something for me
that art had never done.
It seemed that there had been\na reality there that had not
had any expression in art.
The experience of the road\nwas something mapped out
but not socially recognized.
And I thought to myself,\nit ought to be clear
that that's the end of art.
Painting looks pretty\npictorial after that.
There\'s no way to frame it--"
And I'm suggesting he's\nsaying there's no way
to frame that landscape\nlike you frame a painting,
but there's also\nno way to frame it
given the conventional\nconcepts of art.
There's no way to\nconceptually frame it.
You just have to experience it.
This is actually already\na theory of inscription,
though he doesn't use the word.
A year later Derrida\nwould publish--
actually the collected\nessays he publishes it--
so probably it was\nwritten at the same time
Smith was writing this.
Derrida would for the first\ntime use the word inscription
theoretically.
The context is Derrida is\nquoting Antonin Artuad's
description of a\npainful experience
that he always has in\ncreative writing, This
moment where you\nfeel like you're
entirely trained, and\nprepared, and experienced.
He's at the top of his career,\nbut he has nothing to say.
This combination of high\nlevel of skill and drawing
a blank Derrida\nsays actually should
be understood as the\nvery condition from which
all artistic expression comes.
It's not an anomaly.
This is Derrida.
"The thought of the thing\nas what it is already merges
with--" actually the reading\nbecomes confused with
"--the experience\nof pure speech."
Now pure speech, pure word,\nis a code word for Derrida.
It just means the\nassumption that
some unadulterated\nextreme level of speech
is the beginning\nof any expression.
He says, "When we try\nto think reality--",
or what Smith calls\nreality, it first
gets confused with the\nexperience of pure speech,
or just with experience itself.
And then he says,\nbut doesn't pure
speech, which he should\nhave in quotations,
as if there could be such\na thing, pure potential,
doesn't it require inscription?
Something in the manner\nof the way essence
requires existence, and thereby\npushes on towards the world.
In other words essence,\nto think of the thing
as it already is, to\nthink of its essence,
requires existence,\nmaterialization.
And only through\nthat materialization,
which he here calls inscription,\ncan existence act on the world.
Or sorry, potential then\ncan act on the world.
Now up here what\nSmith calls reality,
Derrida is calling\nthe thing as it is.
Thought about reality\nmerges with the experience
of pure speech, which\nis an extreme case,
but which really means pure\npotential, pure possibility.
That kind of pure possibility.
The experience of\nthis pure potential,
which Smith says has never\nbeen expressed in art, which
the road now conveys,\nhas been mapped out,
Smith says, but not\nsocially recognized.
It's materially there.
It's been inscribed,\nmapped out, but it's not
yet socially coded.
It's blank.
It's there materially, but\nit's not there semantically.
But it's already mapped.
According to Derrida,\nthat materialization
has to happen before coding.
Coding is not first.
Semantic is not first.
First, it has to\nbe pure material.
And that's what the turnpike is.
Inscription is potential pushing\ntoward action, Derrida says.
And note, that this pushing\non is not a neutral force.
It is a specific\nforce, or a vector.
And in Smith's case, that\nspecificity, that vector,
is completely embedded in the\nroad and the landscape, which
is to say architecture.
So inscription here-- and\nthe important point is that
in theory and in practice--
inscription is the\npoint of articulation
between pure potential\nand expression.
Between force and form.
It does not have to\ndo with sign, meaning,
function, but rather potential.
And then just to\nconclude this first part,
I just wanted to remind you\nthat this intellectual field is
actually quite known.
It's just never until\nnow been brought
into architectural practice,\nwhich is what we're saying
happens.
Roland Barthes\ndidn't use the word.
So this is where the\nquotation from Derrida
was published, in a\ncollection of essays.
Roland Barthes never used\nthe word inscription,
but he used the word scriptable,\nscriptable, a French neologism
as it is in English.
But he compares the scriptable\ntext to the readable text.
The readable text is a text of\npleasure, purely consumable.
It's easy.
It's lazy.
It's the novel that you\nread to go to sleep by.
That's the readable text.
The scriptable text\nactually disrupts
novelistic expectations.
It must be constantly performed.
It must be constantly\ninterpreted.
Every time you read it again and\nagain, you have to re-enact it.
And it will be different.
Because he says reading\na scriptable text
is like writing a text yourself.
And it's associated not with\npleasure, but with jouissance,
which we will come back to.
A pleasure that is\nmore like a bliss,
but a bliss almost painful and\ndisruptive of expectations.
Paul de Man on the other\nhand, writing in English
for most of his\nintellectual career,
distinguished between what\nhe called phenomentality,
which is actual experience\nof certain concrete things,
and what he called the\nmateriality of inscription,
which he says has to\nbe prior to phenomenon.
He and Derrida are\nvery, very close.
The Wordsworth example I\nactually got from Paul de Man.
He talks about\nthat the scratches
on the surface of the stone\ncan be perceived as phenomenon.
You can experience them in a\nconcrete way, but to the extent
that they can be read, there\nhas to be this sedimentation
of cultural history.
There has to be the cultural\napparatus of reading itself
which is already in place.
That's what the\nepitaph presupposes,
that that apparatus will be\nthere when the person comes
and performs the reading.
So again, architecture\npreceding speech.
So just a note to the\nboth of us, Michael.
At some point I\nwould like to return
to this idea of the road not\ntaken out of the '60s that's
happening again now.
So if Michael gave\nyou a kind of overview
of the intellectual genesis\nof our curatorial effort,
I would like to give\nyou a kind of sense
of some of our\nearly conversations
as we're simply surveying\nthe visual field of artifacts
and examining\ncontemporary practice.
And I would say that the origins\nof the show in that sense,
in a kind of optical sense,\ndeveloped as this suspicion
or doubt about a cliche\nthat is almost totally
dominant in its characterization\nof the architectural field.
And the cliche goes\nsomething like this--
architecture is a centerless\nfield at the moment.
And this is a kind\nof new condition,
but it's centerless and\nanything is possible.
And that perhaps in our\ncontemporary condition,
architecture has\nlost all measure
except an oscillation between\nthe spectacular and the banal.
So this collage by OMA is kind\nof an emblematic expression
of this cliche, architecture\nas a sort of centerless field
in which anything goes.
This of course was produced\nas a kind of diagram
to advocate on behalf of\ntheir Dubai Renaissance
project, which is\nsometimes known
as the Dubai slab, the big\nwhite thing in the middle.
And according to OMA, if we\nadopt the view of this cliche,
there are only two\nrational design options.
We can either compete on\nthe grounds of spectacle
and make better icons.
That's what everyone\nin the background
is doing in OMA's collage.
Or we can design voids\nin the visual field
and perform a kind\nof act of erasure.
Central to this view is the idea\nthat the canon has collapsed.
That this let's say core group\nof mostly Italian buildings
from 1500 to 1950, let's\nAlberti to Tehrani,
is no longer studied\nin such a way
that it would give\nus a kind of measure
other than this oscillation\nbetween spectacle and banality.
And so we would like to\nsort of respectfully object
to this view.
It's quite common, but we would\nlike to propose something else.
And we would like to\ndo so on two grounds.
The first is this.
And so, of course, this is\none of Piranesi's Vedute.
This is his depiction of the\nTemple of Minerva Medica.
And I think for\nus this indicates
that the canon has always\nbeen represented back
to the discipline as being\nin a state of collapse.
So let's say from\nthe very moment
of the invention of\nthe canon, per se,
and its various inventions\nin the 18th century,
it was being projected\nback to architects
through drawing as something\nin a disordered state
that must be rationalized\nfrom this state of abjection,
and cleaned up\nand taken up again
as a kind of affirmative\nset of principles.
So, of course,\nPiranesi is not alone
in this kind of depiction\nof the canon as something
that must be recovered\nfrom an abject state
through difficulty\nand rationalization.
And this is sort of always the\nway in which it arrives to us,
and we just need to\nsort of work harder
to discern its patterns\nand tendencies.
Secondly, aside from the\nsort of historical truism
that the canon is always\nin a state of collapse,
we would like to claim that\nwe do see fairly evident order
and rationality in the field.
It's simply not a form\nof order and rationality
that could be so\neasily structured
by the core periphery model that\nwould be indicated by a cannon
or a kind of collapse thereof.
So we'll just say that the issue\nof the canon is moot for us
or maybe not a part of\nthis discussion, per se.
And we're interested\nin a field of relations
that are more\nhorizontal, that could
be included under this sort\nof umbrella term, resemblance.
Or at least resemblance was\na kind of guiding principle
as we started to detect order\nand repetition in the field
as we saw it.
Or at least the field\nas it's represented
in the Druker Gallery.
This term resemblance\nis important for us
because it indicates this kind\nof appeal to something shared.
An appeal to a certain\nform of cultural agreement
that precedes speech.
An agreement that is\npassed between authors
and establishes continuity\nbetween two things.
And resemblance for us can start\nin a very simple way, simply
with the acknowledgment\nof a kind of visual rhyme.
Oh yeah.
We have red and green,\nand green is far and away
the better pointer.
Here we go.
So it begins with\nthe acknowledgment
of a kind of visual rhyme.
And it need not be a\nkind of high genre rhyme.
Low is absolutely fine with us.
It can even be bodily.
So in this case,\nwe would say you
can see a kind of rhyme that\nhas to do with protuberances
and finger like digitation\nbeing produced by architects
and sort of differentiating the\ndetailing in their buildings.
And although the rhyme may\nstart at the level of intuition
and a kind of low\ngenre, we think
it's fairly easy to\nstart to build up
a degree of sophistication\nin identifying
these kinds of through\nlines or continuities
in the work of\ncontemporary practices.
And to do that\nwork, we might lean
on a text like\nFoucault's discourse
on similitude in\nthe Renaissance,
which, of course, is all about\nthese sort of modes and methods
of establishing resemblance.
And this speciating resemblance\ninto different techniques
that we can sort of identify\napart from one another.
And so I'm just\ngoing to take you
through some\nsnippets of the show
and start to call out these\nforms of resemblance that
establish little through lines.
And then after that, Michael\nwill situate those smaller
similarities inside a kind\nof much bigger field of ideas
and possible positions.
So all of these that\nI'm going to show--
I'll show four of them now--\nare snippets from the wall.
And I'd like to call out these\nsort of three way continuities.
So in the center we have\nEllie Abron's Inside Things.
And for us, this\nestablishes the proposition
that the architectural\ndigit can clasp.
That it affords\na kind of support
by entanglement and intimacy.
And then of course Mack Scogin\nand Merrill Elam's Wolfsburg
Competition entry project\ntakes on that idea of support
as a kind of\nliteral proposition.
To lift the plinth that sort\nof elevated above the city.
And it's interesting here that\nthis sort of bodily digitation
is support for a kind of\nunadulterated architectural
plinth that can be\nre-read as a kind of head
because of the legs.
And of course it\nwould be the plinth
that is identified as\nthe head, because it's
this sort of seat of\nnon bodily knowledge
atop a bodily support.
On the other side we\nhave Outpost Office.
This is a selection\nfrom their series called
Computer Architecture,\nwhere there
is no longer this separation\nbetween architecture
and its bodily support, but\ninstead the entire building
has become enfolded in a\nkind of clasping digit.
The exteriorisation\nof the support
disappears in favor of these\nsort of internal pleats
that might organize the\nsection of the building.
So for Foucault, this\nmode of similitude
would be called analogy.
That each of these is related\nto the other because of the way
they are constantly\nmaking reference
to the body as a shared form\nof agreement between them.
There is another\nkind of resemblance
that we could call convenience.
And convenience would have to\ndo with shared forces operating
on the same set of material.
Foucault would call it\nan adjacency of places
so that their edges touch,\nand movement, influence,
and passions can be communicated\nbetween these places.
So for us, Johnston\nMarklee's Hut House
would occupy a kind\nof central position
in this sort of through\nline of resemblance
in that there's a rotation that\nis kind of playing on the found
stuff of the eidetic house.
That they are torquing sort\nof roofs, walls, and windows.
And it's the same material that\nis taken up by Sean Canty's Ja
House, also in a rotation.
And similarly, in one of the\nartifacts from Erin Besler's
Low Fidelity series of\nprojects, where again,
a kind of shearing\nand rotation are
operating on this found and\nknown stuff of the house.
And it is that kind of shared\nmaterial and shared operation
that would establish the kind\nof convenient relationship
between these.
This is a kind of\nselection of what
we would call trabeated stacks.
And here maybe we\ncould borrow the term
that Foucault uses to describe\nanother kind of resemblance--
emulation, which is a form of\nresemblance without contact.
So if convenience requires\nthis sort of superimposition
of places and\nshared materiality,
emulation does not\nrequire that in order
to set up this field of\nrelatedness between projects.
Instead, they can work on\nvery different material
and sort of reflect one\nanother as a kind of gaze
in the mirror.
So this is Ensamble Studio,\nthe Hemeroscopium House.
This is our very own Jennifer\nBonner from Best Sandwiches.
I believe this is\nthe Grilled Cheese.
And Farshid Moussavi is\nagain, one of our very own--
Divine Folly.
So in each case there is\na very clear reflection
of this idea of\nthe trabeated stack
and yet, sandwich is\nradically unlike fragment
of infrastructure is radically\nunlike the kind of undulating
and purely formal perimeter\nof the concrete slabs
in the Follies.
So they do not require that\nshared overlap of place
in order to perform\nthis reflection.
And lastly, we would talk\nabout this more distant form
of similitude that we\ncould term sympathy.
And this is a kind of drawing\nthings toward one another
in an exterior and\nvisible movement.
So here I would like to begin\nwith Toshiko Mori's Dialogue
in Details, where\nshe is examining
several important\nbuildings, but only
extracting a very small slice\nof their system of construction
and setting it\nfree in a gallery.
Painting it entirely\nwhite so that it
becomes being-like or\nfigure-like in its presence.
And it is that kind of\nseparation then of entities
sort of pulled out\nfrom context that
allows us to understand a kind\nof sympathetic relationship
between figures.
Toshiko's Dialogue in Details,\nChrist Gantenbein's Athens
Series of occasional tables\nthat similarly establish
this kind of figural\ndistance that then allows
us to relate them as characters\nin a room to Toshiko's project.
And then on the\nvery end, this is
a project by Central\nStandard Office
and Kelly Bair called The\nCat That Ate the Canary.
These are all\nradically different
in terms of their\nfunction and let's say
kind of didactic machinery.
This is an installation.
This is furniture.
This is a bird house.
But it's this\nmechanism of sympathy
that allows these figural things\nby virtue of their standing
apart to develop a\nkind of relationship.
So now what we want to\ndo is make the claim
and try to convince you briefly\nthat despite this wide variety
and heterogeneity\nof work that we're
drawing from, that there\nis a mechanism somehow,
a deep structure that actually\ngenerates that these projects
have in common.
And this deep structure, or what\nI earlier called a materiality,
is common across that field.
In 1968, A.J. Greimas provided\na kind of little machine
that he called the\nsemiotic square.
Of course this contradicts\nall the anti-semiotic rhetoric
I was talking about\nearlier, but it's a matter
of just using the term.
He's still using\nthe term semiotic,
which we're claiming that\nthe structure of the square
works in a non-semiotic\nway as well.
So I hadn't realized\nthat before.
I just read that word.
The square is designed to\ndiagram the way in which
from a single starting\npoint, that an entire complex
of permutations, positions,\na sort of combinatory
of positions can be derived.
It's essentially\na sort of updating
of actually an Aristotelian\nlogic of contradictions
and contraries, where a\nbeginning term always,
of course, produces its other.
But any term will not only\nhave its direct opposite,
or its contradiction,\nbut will also
produce other oppositions\nthat also oppose
its own first contradiction.
Rather than go through\nthe mathematics of this,
I'm going to give a very\nquick example of how
it works with something that\nI hope you're familiar with,
which is Claude Levi Strauss'\nThe Raw and the Cooked.
Now in Levi Strauss' work, of\ncourse, The Raw and the Cooked,
raw food and cooked food by the\nend stand for an entire network
of social and familial\nrelationships that structure
not only culinary efforts, but\nthings like the incest taboo,
and which cousin can you\nmarry and which you can't.
And it's a very\nelaborate structure
that finds its root in\nwhat Levi Strauss calls
a culinary triangle.
With Levi Strauss it only\nhas three terms, the raw
and its opposite, the cooked.
And then something that Levi\nStrauss says and he's already
doing the structuralist\nright thing by saying,
well anything that\nhas its opposite
will produce other\nkinds of oppositions.
So the raw and the rotten,\nor the cooked and the rotten.
So for Levi Strauss,\nyou get this triangle.
What Greimas does is\nsay that actually it's
the square that will\nproduce an even more
interesting fourth term.
Because if the cooked is\nthe opposite of the raw,
this unknown fourth\nterm here would
be something like a stronger\npositively anti raw.
And Levi Strauss\ndidn't suggest it,
but the point is that\nto use the Greimas,
your mind immediately\nstarts putting together
other possible logics.
So I'm suggesting\nfermented, which
is neither cooked nor raw,\nbut also not quite rotten.
And what's interesting\nabout it is that it
is related to the rotten.
It's boiled, right?
But it's also in a way related\nas a contrary to the cooked,
because it's a different\nway of consuming food.
And you can't consume either,\nat least in this case.
You couldn't consume\neither raw or rotten.
So you get a highly mobile,\na highly dynamic field.
And it's just this\nkind of field that we
wanted to use to structure the\nwork that Andrew just sampled.
We started in a\ndialectical opposition
that we thought all\narchitecture had.
And that's the opposition\nbetween the transcendental
and the imminent.
It's in philosophy.
It's in Aristotle.
It's also in architecture.
The imminent for\nus is represented
by this casting of Ensamble.
Whereas traditional\ninterpretation
would go back to the\narchitectural image,
to its signifiers, to\nits sensory pleasure,
but the image here by\ncontrast, is produced.
For example, from the tug\nof gravity on the concrete,
which of course has the earth.
You dig out a hole\nand pour in this slab,
and then remove the\nearth, or actually
raise it up from the earth,\nbut the tug of gravity
gives it this kind of\nparticular image on the button.
Or the heat transfers between\nthe concrete and the earth that
causes certain chemical\nmutations and colorings
and different hardnesses.
So this exchange of heat.
In other examples we\nhave this propagation
of light from unseen sources.
So all of these kind of\nearthy, bodily, phenomenal,
and sometimes even\ncosmic considerations
that lead to almost--
and if we wanted to think about\narchitecture before speech.
In this case, it's almost--
In the case of the\nimminent category,
it's almost a kind of\ngrunting, babbling,
stuttering, as before speech\nin that almost archaic sense.
You know, the direct\nopposite of that
again might be something\nlike Justin Marklee's houses.
And this may not\neven be the best one
they were calling\ntranscendental,
if what we mean\nby that is a kind
of attention to\nform and process,
but also Boolean operations.
Boolean is just like when\nyou use a search engine,
you can say this and\nthat, or this or that.
And you can see here,\nit's this and this again,
or it's this or this one.
And you get in these\nkind of series.
So what's interesting\nis Johnston Marklee
always do about four\nversions of a single project
using the same elements.
And that's part of what\nwe're calling transcendental,
because it has to do with this\ncertain kind of very high level
mimesis.
The other examples we\ngive are labyrinths
that are digitally generated,\nor stochastic patterns
in elevation.
This is very divorced from\nthe organically related frames
and cycles of the imminent.
So that's our first dialectic.
The transcendental which attends\nto issues of form, structure,
probably type.
Type is a very good\nexample of what
we're calling transcendental.
These are highly articulable,\nre-instantiated, re-iterable.
They're given, whereas\nthese tend to be more found
in nature or in the lab.
But highly sensible, attention\nto material over form,
phenomenon over structure, and\ntopos, or place, over type.
So that's the first dialectic.
But then there's\nthis other category.
Let's say that we believe in the\ntranscendental project, but not
its truth.
What will happen in that\ncase is if you think
you can no longer actually\nfind an answer, what you start
to enjoy is the pursuit itself,\nthe process, the sheer artifice
of the discipline\ndriven machinations
that you go through in design.
And this will be\nvery complicated.
It will produce\nprojects of traces,
superimposition,\nstacks, scatters.
It'll produce effects like\ntiling, nesting, buckling,
pleating.
All of these are these kind\nof nervous, compulsory,
kind of hand wringing\nmachinations.
Because you know you're not\ngoing to arrive at the answer,
but you're enjoying the pursuit.
And then it will\nbe a revelation.
And this was Andrew's\ninsistence that we name it.
There will be this revelation\nto this overly compulsive
processes.
On the one hand, it's related\nto but kind of opposition
to the transcend.
It's still formalist,\nlet's say, but now it's
no longer about a kind\nof given structure,
but it's about a\nrevelation of an artifice.
It's certainly not imminent.
It's exactly the opposite of\nthe earthy, phenomenal, bodily,
mimetic category here.
But what about this one?
How could we get a\nstrong response that
might be related to the bodily\nmimesis of the imminent,
but might also be related to\nthe kind of doubt, and artifice,
and nervousness about revealing\nthe artifice as opposed
to in a way believing\nin the artifice.
And of course, we found it\nin a number of projects.
But again, sticking\nto our own faculty
with Mack Scogin and Merrill\nElam's Wolfsburg Tower, which
originally I wanted to call the\ncategory creaturely encounters.
But we stuck with just\nthe idea of encounter
to match the others.
The characteristics here--\nagain, like the imminent,
it involves body.
But in this case\nthe mimesis is only
an approximation to the human.
It's this just not quite human,\nwhich is anxiety producing.
It's this not\nquite human mimesis
that provokes this attention\ntoward the creaturely.
It's as if this thing like a\ngolem in the old Jewish ghettos
just appeared somehow, right?
To save the city but\nhumans had nothing
to do with its creation.
It's like architectural golem.
It seems prehistorical,\npre-verbal.
Lacan has a beautiful\nword that I'm using here
that when things that are\nmost familiar, most intimate,
turn out to be not\nquite right, he
says the feeling of extimacy.
Or this extimant as\nopposed to intimate.
It's this thing that\nyou thought you knew
that is now radically other.
And I think that categorization,\nor that explanation, is right.
And then, finally, when\nyou look at this Greimas
diagram outside--
imminent, originals,\ntranscendental.
This is the kind\nof formalist axis.
This is the kind of\nphenomenological axis,
but this is more\nphenomenology gone wrong.
This is kind of\nformalism, in a way,
exaggerated and artificial.
So you can start to play with\nall these different connections
with the works across.
And then finally--\nand I'll stop here--
what we imagine is again,\ngoing back to inscription.
I said that inscription\nis when force and--
if we think of this\nas a force field
producing all these\nvectors and relationships--
is this what I'm here\ncalling virtual architecture,
and where the inscription\nbegins here and passes
through different kinds of\ndisciplinary strategies,
different kind of archives.
This triangle, or\ncone, of inscription
draws from that virtual deep\nstructure that you can't see.
This is the pre-supposed\nthat Wordsworth talks about,
and then you finally end up\nwith an actual architectural
project.
All right.
So we thought this\nwas a neat trick
that one of our diagrams\nsort of turned upside down
equals the other.
So I think we'd like\nto close this segment
of the conversation\nbetween the two of us
by talking about\neffects and affects,
which is maybe a turn\nfrom the description
of possible positions in\nthe ideological field,
to asking the\nquestion, what claims
can we make with\nrespect to the audience?
And particularly,\nwhat claims can we
make about the instrumentality\nof the building with respect
to the audience?
Or maybe occasionally I should\nuse this word, beholder.
Because we are\nindebted in some way
to the work of Michael Fried.
So let's begin here to start\nto get at this question.
This is an image of a model\nthat Wonne Ickx and Productora
did in their proposal\nfor Aalto University.
And for us, this was the kind\nof first glimpse of a recurring
trope that we see\nagain and again,
almost like a kind\nof tic, particularly
in the category that we've\ndecided to call monoliths.
So this is a project\nby Geers Van Severen.
All of their projects are\nnumbered, so this is 152.
This is the Aalto University\nproject by Productora,
and this is Jesus\nVassallo's Water Towers.
But in each of these,\nwe see a similar kind
of awareness of the frame and\na similar kind of clustering
of towers against one another\nwith respect to the frame
as though there is a kind\nof acute interest there.
That these seem sort of too\nperfectly framed and too
perfectly clustered for\nthis to be accidental.
And I think that we would argue\neach of these three images
is in fact this, a\nkind of tower selfie,
where the tower is aware\nof both its position
as a subject, but also the\npossible subject positions
that it engenders.
So what I mean by that.
This is you, the subject.
You're taking a\nphotograph of Kimye,
but their affects, their\ndeportment, and their bearing
has a kind of consequence\nthat flows back to you
as the subject.
So the flatness of Kanye's\nscowl in a certain way
denies the importance,\nor even denies
the presence of the\nbeholder, you, the subject.
And Kim's simper does something\nsort of very different.
And so we would like\nto sort of start
to think through the\nwork in those terms.
In terms of how the\naffects of the buildings
start to permit and open\nup different subject
positions while\nthey deny others.
And maybe before we start to\nrehearse the possible positions
that are on evidence\nin the Druker gallery,
we should just emphasize\nthe kind of difference
in this mode of thinking from\nother ways in which affect
has historically been\ntaken up by architecture.
So it's clear here\nthat we're trying
to argue that affect gives\narchitecture a kind of role
to play almost as an audience\nmember in terms of the way
that it starts to go\nto work on subjects.
But historically, affect has\nworked maybe more like this.
So these are the self-portraits\nof Jean-Jacques Lequeu,
where he is kind of depicting\nthese extreme emotions.
And we would call this\nanother different way
of thinking through affect,\nwhere we are interested in how
buildings make you feel.
What stimulus results in what\nkind of externally observable
response?
So this is very\ndifferent I would say.
Maybe the work, we\nwould argue, is not
so interested in how\nit makes you feel.
It is, however, using affect\nto construct possible positions
with respect to it.
So perhaps with any luck\nthat distinction makes sense.
So here I'm going\nto start working
my way through the second of the\ndiagrams on the wall outside.
And I'm going to build it\nup in a series of layers
that are similar to Michael's\ndescription of the Greimas
square.
And I think we would like\nto begin with flat affects,
because I think you will find\na great number of the works
on display build a possible\nsubject position for you that
is very much like being on\nthe receiving end of Kanye's
scowl, a kind of a flatness.
And for us, flatness\nis not homogeneous.
Instead, it has a kind of\nnear and a far horizon.
A nearness that we will\ncall an imperious presence,
and a kind of far\nhorizon that we'll
call disinterested withdrawal.
So an imperious presence\nmight be something like this.
Again Geers Van\nSeveren, project 152,
where the building\nis quite near,
but that does not necessarily\nentail an engagement
with the beholder.
Instead, it is a\nkind of aloofness.
Or this Machado and Silvetti's\ntower from The Four Squares
project.
This is the Leonforte tower.
Again, it is quite\nnear, but that nearness
should not in any way be\nconfused with accessibility.
It is aloof.
It is imperious.
It is literally above.
And for us, maybe that sense\nof a kind of imperious nearness
would be tantamount to let's\nsay Louis the 14th's sort
of arrival with his retinue.
This is a tapestry, 1670-ish.
It's part of a longer series\ncalled The History of the King.
This is documenting Louis'\narrival into the Gobelins.
He is attended by everyone,\nand yet he does not care.
He is staring out of the\nframe of the tapestry
and his attention is elsewhere.
It is a kind of\ndenial of his retinue.
So if that's the\nnear horizon, I think
you'll also find examples\nof this far horizon
disinterest that takes\nthe form of a withdrawal.
So this is T.E.A.M., their\nDetroit Reassembly Plant
project, where the building\nis not only withdrawn,
as in literally hiding as a\nrecluse behind piles of refuse.
But it is also a\nform that refuses
to didactically explain its\nlumpen appearance in any way.
It is simply a kind of given.
A slightly awkward given, let's\nsay, that constitutes for us
a form of withdrawal.
Maybe even more to the point,\nthis is SIFT Studio's Rocks.
And this is an\narchitect withdrawing
to the kind of hermetically\nsealed zone of geology.
Like we may not inquire\ninto its processes.
It is simply there.
This sort of movement\nback and forth
between the near and the\nfar horizon, of the flat
affects in the show,\nthey are metered also
in another direction.
So here we might talk about\nthe impassive, the depressed,
the absorbed, the bored,\nor the distracted.
And so this project\nby First Office.
I think it's fair to\ncall it bored or boring.
They, in fact, I\nthink, would appreciate
me designating this as a boring\nproject, or a bored project.
But there's simply not much here\nin the kind of white on white.
It's easy to sort of\ngo adrift in the kind
of total lack of interest in\nthe flat field of the rendering.
A kind of close relative\nwould be absorbed.
This is another\nproject by First Office
for the design of\na table that is
to be assembled out of\nIkea parts, but a very
difficult table.
And all of this kind of\ndelirium of technical notation,
we would argue, has to do\nwith a kind of absorption
in the facts of\nthe drawing itself.
A denial of the\nbeholder in the sense
that all attention is supposed\nto be sort of measuring
the difference between\n2 feet three inches
and 3 feet 6 and 1/4, or\nwhatever it is up there.
This moment of the kind\nof absorbed band in flat
affects for us is very\nimportant, because it
becomes a point of connection.
Or let's say a connective\ntissue with a very different way
of thinking through\naffect in the show
in a different category of work\nthat has to do with jouissance.
So in a second I'm going to\nreturn to this point, which
is important to us, where\njouissance makes contact
with the field of flat affects.
But just to kind of\nquickly rehearse--
and Michael may want to\ninterject because this is sort
of right in his wheel house.
But jouissance as\nI understand it,
is not only pleasure, but\na particular intensity
to pleasure.
And as French theorists\nhave taken up this term,
that intensity may also be\npainful at the same time
that one experiences pleasure.
So it has these two\ndifferent modalities.
And for us,\njouissance moves kind
of upward in increasing\nlevels, not only of
intensity and pleasure,\nbut let's say also
in increasing authorization\nof the beholder.
So if flat affects have\nfound these various gambits
for denying your presence, or\nby sort of completely absorbing
attention in the\nfield, jouissance
does something different.
There is a form of\ninvitation to experience
that is issued by the work.
And so at the very bottom\npoint of jouissance
would be work that we\ncharacterize as feral.
And for us, this is maybe\nlike a dog digging a hole.
A kind of total\nattendance to the task.
Almost absorption,\nbut still a kind
of minimum awareness\nof environment
and of the possibility\nof a viewing subject.
A kind of, let's say,\nanimal awareness of context.
And for us, Bittertang's\nproject, Bessie,
is a kind of ideal feral.
This one deserves a\nlittle explanation
so I asked Bittertang\nto submit renderings
of this project, Bessie.
And in its original conception,\nlet's say in 2013 or '14,
it was a proposal for a zero\nwaste tent made of cowhides,
and bones, and remains after\nthe consumption of the cow.
So you would eat the\ncows, use their skins,
and use their bones to make this\nkind of tent-like inhabitation.
When I requested a\nmodel of this project
I was told that\ncows don't scale.
[laughter]
And so instead,\nthey would make us
a new model out of\nCornish game hens
that were of a size that\ncould fit on the pedestals.
And so they purchased Cornish\ngame hens, roast them,
ate them, and produced\nthe model that you
see on display in\nthe gallery, which
I think is a kind\nof breathtaking idea
about sensibility.
And perhaps one that\nissues a challenge
to our very own HouseZero.
I think moving upward\nthrough the various strata
in jouissance is the object.
So here I am indulging\nmyself a little bit.
This is a project by my own\noffice, The Los Angeles Design
Group.
And here the abject\nis in our ability
to identify these little\nbits and trinkets.
A kind of unfolded box, a\npipe, some dirt, wood blocks.
But these have all fallen\nfrom the station where
we might have originally\nencountered them, as a trinket,
let's say, in the\nMcMaster-Carr Catalog.
So it is the fall\nthat is responsible
both for our pleasure\nthat we might
take in a model like this,\nbut also for its abjection.
A bit higher up, but also\nkind of closely related
to abjection, would be\nthe kind of delightful.
And this again is Jennifer\nBonner of MALL and her Grilled
Cheese trabeated stack.
And here the delight\nis not in observing
the collapse of a\nsystem of manners,
but in its maintenance, no\nmatter how absurd it might be.
So we can see the sandwich.
The sandwich is not contested.
The sandwich has not fallen.
Similarly, we can see the\nimprint of a relatively
reasonable building facades.
And then finally,\nabove the delightful,
we would place the ecstatic.
This is a project by Millions,\nZeina Koreitem, and John May
one of a series of\nprojects on collectives.
And here, the delight\nis in the experience
of a technique that\nalmost overwhelms
the material construct\non which it plays out.
And so it's kind of like the\npleasure of technique runamuck
right up until the point where\nit threatens the integrity
of the entire enterprise.
And for us, at that sort of\nlimit condition of the ecstatic
production of\narchitecture, we're
also starting to introduce\na kind of invitation
to the audience.
A sort of total\ninvolvement of architecture
with people at the\nscale of the body.
All of these\ninfinitesimally small little
crannelations that\none would continually
encounter as you move\nthrough the building
at the scale of yourself.
A kind of a threat of\ndissolution between you
and the building, or a\ndissolution of the distinction
between you and the building,\nthat is both kind of ecstatic
and has this kind of painful\nquality to it as well.
Maybe as a kind\nof closing thought
before we move on\nto conversation,
I would say that the\ndiagram that we are not
talking about too\nmuch here at the end
starts to build a case for us\nabout the place of authorship
in a show like this.
So if we've expended\na great deal of energy
surveying the field, and\nattempting to describe it
with as much precision\nas we can muster,
there is this sort of unanswered\nquestion of like, what now,
the task of the architect\nif we have indeed
identified a kind of\ncontemporary trope that holds.
And perhaps we would posit that\nthe signature of the author
is no longer the kind\nof operative term
that we should be looking for.
Instead, it's the kind of\nauthor as the maintainer,
or the author as the one\nwho tends and sort of brings
to the fore these\ncultural agreements that
precede semantic meaning.
Yeah.
Thanks.
[applause]
So we hope we've left\ntime, and we didn't
leave as much as we tried.
But we hope we've left\nsome time for comments.
Maybe it's obvious, but to\nemphasize that of course you
challenge our categorization\nand you challenge
what slot we put some of these\nprojects into, which I think
is kind of the point of\ntrying to find relationships
by allowing and inventing\nnew types of reading.
Not just to be satisfied\nwith one mode or another,
but to try to open up new kinds\nof reading these projects that
find connections as\nmuch as disjunctions.
And that we hope is part\nof the pleasure of the show
is kind of playing\nthat interpretive game.
Alexander.
Thank you so, so\nmuch for sharing
all of this art with us.
And I think that there is an\nincredibly commendable kind
of attention to\nreading the field,
as fragmented and\nde-centered as it is.
My question is\nbasically whether it
is possible to sustain a reading\nof the models in the hall
as anything but spectacle.
And if we were to identify\nin the presentation
a series of binaries,\nwe might say
the first of them is imminent\nversus transcendental.
Or for my benefit, [inaudible]\nbinary of form or physique
versus morale and discourse.
And then the second I think\nis Michael Fried's binary
of absorption and theatricality.
But I think the\npinnacle of my question
is, when we're calling\nBittertang's consumption
of a chicken anything\nbut theatrical,
we started to have some\nquestions about the degree
to which we can\nsustain differences
between the bottles on a basis\nother than theatricality.
So I guess I wonder how we would\nhow we would start to do that.
So what I would say, and try\nto develop if I had time, would
be that to dismiss the chicken,\nthough it is one of the most
extreme cases, I think.
But to dismiss it\nis still to hold
to a mode of reading\nwhich privileges vision
over other kinds\nof performances.
The comparison with zero house\nis actually really interesting.
What we normally\ncall zero carbon,
it still has nothing to do\nwith the possible wastes
in recycling.
But we don't yet have a\nway of bringing those kinds
of very real considerations in.
And it goes without\nsaying that most
of the preponderance of projects\nare very preliminary stages
of experimentation.
Some are actually built, of\ncourse, but most are not.
And I think as an\nexperimentation,
and even as a kind of manifesto\nabout consumption, recycling,
that we have to find new ways\nof evaluating and reading
those projects.
Fried never leaves\nthe platform of vision
with his theatricality\nversus absorption.
I don't disagree except\nto say let's think
about more bodily, earthly,\nbut also more cosmic things,
as well as vision.
Let me just add\none thing quickly
before you ask your question.
I would say let's not\nconfuse intensity generically
with theater.
That there are\ncertain agreements
that must be in place in order\nto sustain the theatrical that
don't apply to intensity\nkind of generically.
And so I think we\nhave to make room
for some form of presence of\nthe viewing subject that is not
in that kind of\ntheatrical relationship
that Fried would\nascribe to anything
that admits of a beholder.
So if I sit down\nto eat my dinner
and it happens to\nbe a chicken, that
is not necessarily theater.
And so I would be\ninterested in kind
of testing the limits of the\nintensity of that proposition
before it sort of slides over\ninto this other form that
requires another\nset of agreements.
Yeah.
I also amplify your thanks for\nthis incredibly revealing talk
and presentation.
Exhibition.
Michael, can I ask you to\nengage in active, pure thought?
You had me at\nWordsworth, and what you
didn't seem to address--
[laughter]
--is the first five\nwords of the talk,
because you dwelled on\nepitaph and monument.
But the quote starts with,\n"It needs scarcely be said--",
which is classic preterition,\nso clearly it need be said.
Yeah.
Exactly.
That moment is called\napophasis, when
you say it need not be said.
But remember, what I think--
It need not be\nsaid clearly means
that this is really important.
And it is the first\nline of a book.
So he's thought\nabout these words.
But again, I just simply read it\nas an introduction to the fact
that his interest is going to\nbe things that are not said.
And it need not be said, because\nit can be sensed or apprehended
in other ways.
And so I think there's a\ncircle in that first line
that it need not be said.
And even the epitaph's real--
And don't forget the\nother side of apophasis.
What is it called\nwhen death speaks?
Pro-- propo-- proposophis?
It's full of\nrhetorical machines,
because an epitaph is\noften attributed to speech
from the dead.
So it need not be said is also\nit can't be said by a human.
And this kind of\ninhuman quality,
which some of the things\nthat we keep returning
to like indifference,\nboredom, the feral, these
are also non-human, thing-like\nqualities that I think
is in that first line as well.
Lane.
Sorry for the third\nmale question.
And I have two things.
So first is I was hoping\nthat you would come back
to the question of\nthe 1960's discourse
and how that's been read,\nhow that has somehow returned
or not.
And the second is direct\ncuratorial question
about the exhibition,\nwhich is that on one wall,
you have these diagrams.
And on the other wall,\nyou have the work itself.
And in a way, the work itself\nis organized purely visually,
purely based on vision.
And I think the analysis\nthat Andrew performed on it
is largely visual and\nonly transcends being
visual when you've mapped\nit onto these diagrams.
So I wonder, why you have on\nthe East wall put the work,
and on the West wall\nput the diagrams,
and not allowed\nthem to in that way,
speak to each other or not.
Do you want to take on the '60s?
[laughter]
I'll take on the '60s question.
So Rem Koolhaas' AA\nproject, The Berlin Wall,
which did nothing but\nphotograph the Berlin Wall
and declare it architecture,\nwas really, really interesting
in the same way I think that\nthe Tony Smith is interesting.
That the experience\nof the highway
is declared as art\nor as architecture.
But then we started generating\nthings and this is by no--
I don't have this down.
I would like to study this.
Things like Ungers looking\nat Berlin at the time
that it's shrinking and\naccepting the shrinkage.
But even something like\nVenturi's and Scott Brown's
learning from Las Vegas,\nrather than Las Vegas
is an abject sight.
But accepting the\nabjection, of course,
they try to semiotize it.
They try to make\nit into a semiotic.
But the very\ninterest in not just
a vernacular, but an\nabject vernacular,
is very close to some\nof the things that
are going on now like with\nFirst Office is very much that.
So we were looking I\nthink there are, Oh,
in Archizoom in the\nNo-Stop City project,
where the first drawing--
quote unquote\ndrawings of that-- are
done a typewriter with\nzeros, slashes, and pluses
so that they de-skill even\nthe architectural drawing
process in order to produce\nthis different kind of feel.
So I think that we're interested\nin those experimental projects
that embrace the lack\nof meaning and try
to find other sensory,\naffective, these different--
To expand the sensorium again.
I'll give you the wall is\norganized visually but trying
to spark interests that\ngo that go beyond that.
And I think the '60s sort of--
The other thing that for an\nunreconstructed Hegelian,
as Antoine has pointed out\nmany times that I still am,
to have a theoretical discourse\nand an architectural discourse
align around issues of\nmateriality and non-semantic
significance, if\nyou will, is just
thrilling to kind\nof think about.
I would also--
Lane, I appreciate the\nquestion very much.
And I would like to\nmaybe put it in relation
to Alexander's question.
So if Alex is asking,\nhave you indeed escaped
Michael Fried's\njudgment of theater?
And you're asking,\nhave we indeed found
a kind of escape velocity\nfrom the visual field?
Both of those, I think, are\nprofoundly modern questions.
Like, is experience describable\nby this kind of the matrix
construct?
And to what extent are we going\nto think through these sense
data as sort of separate\nstreams where cognition
is hovering above them?
And maybe we would suggest not--
Non-modern position\nis maybe too strong.
But I think we're leaning toward\na kind of non-modern position
where we would not be\nembarrassed to admit
of the visual.
We would also simply claim that\nit is not so easily pried apart
from all of the other\nways in which we might
sort of walk around the world,\nand consume it, and think
about it.
So that the beauty of\nFoucault's meditation
in the order of things,\nthat the prose of the world
where he talks about\nthese Renaissance
systems of similitude, is\nthat there is no easy way
to kind of disentangle these\nprimarily visual metaphors
from the intellectual content\nthat they are organizing
and related to.
So the kind of onion, and brain,\nand dome similitude that he
calls out is optical,\nfor sure, but it is also
a kind of larger ordering\nsystem for the world.
Your talk was fascinating.
My name's Ann Sussman.
I do a blog called The\nGenetics of Design.
I'm a licensed architect.
I think your talk is\nvery, very interesting.
On the other hand, I\nthink it's stuck in time.
We're in Boston, in\nCambridge, the center
of the biotech revolution.
Harvard actually promoted a\nlot of that biotech revolution.
And I think the problem you're\ngoing to face going forward
with this-- this a warning--
is that people are going\nto start assessing it
with biotechnological tools.
Right now I'm a designer.
So I know that car\ndesigners all use biotech.
Honda, BMW.
Advertisers all use biotech.
Facial expression analysis.
I've used eye tracking, EEG.
You can no longer talk\nabout Foucault and Derrida.
Toyota would think\nyou're out of your mind.
And the same brain that looks\nat a car or looks at an ad,
is the same brain that\nlooks at a building.
It's a brain that's\n3.6 billion years old.
It's hardwired from birth\nto like specific images more
than others.
I'm not going to\ntell you what it is.
OK.
So part of your, I think,\nintellectual foundation
is false.
In the first place, the\nmind is not a blank slate.
I'm quoting there Harvard\npsychologist, professor,
Steven Pinker, his\nbestselling book.
You argue the mind's\na blank slate.
The mind's not a blank slate.
Read Steven Pinker.
The other way you're\nconfused in your thinking
is on one hand, you say,\nwhich I agree with, we have
an emotional brain that thinks.
You're saying that a lot.
But on the other hand,\nyou say we have a thinking
brain that has emotions.
You cannot have it both ways.
Read Harvard neuroanatomist\nJill Bolte Taylor.
She's got the most\nhits on YouTube.
She was a neuroanatomist\nwho got a stroke
and watched her brain go down.
So we have an emotional\nbrain that thinks.
So how do we really define\narchitectural theory
knowing we're all emotional?
And here's the kicker.
You can't do it\nunless you're doing
the same tools that Toyota\nand BMW are already using.
So I think your talk is great.
And I think in a way\ntalking about affect
giving architecture\na role to play,
that's absolutely\nwhat they're studying.
But I think you need\nto bring your kids
into the 21st century.
They're going to enter a world--
I know this.
I just got a grant to eye\ntrack buildings in the suburbs.
Your architects won't know\nhow I'm going to assess it.
And I'm going to assess\nit with hard data.
I'm going to tell\nthem that people
can't find the front door.
You get it?
So you've got to take your\ntalk to the next level
because we're in\nCambridge, which
is the center of the\nbiotech revolution.
The fact is paradigm\nshifts are brutal.
They're not nice.
Think about Steve Jobs.
Wasn't a nice guy.
But they're going\nto happen anyway.
They don't care what you did.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be--
But I'd be happy to talk more--
It's definitely fascinating\nto me that one could--
Part of the response\nthat I think
when Andrew was\nresponding to Lane about
not to deny the\nvisual, but to layer
other kinds of\nconsiderations into it.
What I would take from\nyour comment is just that.
That I would love to have a\ngroup of architecture people,
some of whom understood the\ntechnology that you're saying.
But to bring it and add it to\nother techniques of reading.
Rather than let's say,\nlet's forget the old but--
Let me just finish.
Let me just-- One more\nthing because the one thing
that you're\nrecommending, it tends
toward the purely empirical.
So that any dimension that\ncannot be put in terms of data
will be ignored, which is\nin architecture, or in art,
or in culture, is a huge\ndimension of something that
cannot be put into data.
So you're going toward\na kind of empiricism
that's very sophisticated,\nbut it's still in empiricism.
It has no\ntranscendental dimension
of virtuality or speculation.
This is a longer conversation.
No, no.
And I would love to have it.
Yeah.
And I would love to\nhave it with you.
It's very, very powerful.
Yeah.
The most powerful companies in\nthe world would be using it.
And that's what is\ndefining their designs.
No.
What's defining their\ndesigns is the economic hope
of that technology.
We're not talking about an\neconomically driven reading
system here.
You're talking\nabout a data system
that the hope lies\nin its bottom line,
not in its cultural value.
Modern architecture is about\ntechnological revolution.
If it weren't for\nthe steamships,
we wouldn't have had modern\narchitecture, basically.
And so now modern\narchitecture is
faced with a fantastically\ndisruptive new technology.
As disruptive as\nsteamships were.
We could talk later.
I'd be happy to\ngive you my card.
I think it was a great talk.
You can come to my class.
[laughter]
You're on.
You may have stopped\nthe conversation.
Oh.
OK.
Why justify your\nentire reading system
using post-structuralists\nwhen you're
doing a structuralist project?
Oh, they gave me a mic.
Are you guys ready?
But all the post-structuralists\nyou like to cite
reject the concept\nof deep structure,
and you're trying\nto re-imbed one.
Why do you do that?
Yeah.
See.
I always feel that\ntraps are set then
if you don't follow a\nkind of linear logic.
Why can't I be structuralist\nand post-structuralist
based on the kind of explanatory\npower of certain models?
Where did she go?
Oh.
Why can't I continue to use\nFoucault or Derrida if they
help me explain something,\nbut without worrying
about the correctness and the\npurity of keeping it structural
or letting it be\npost-structuralist when
the one came from the other.
I mean, when Derrida writes to\nthe criticism of Levi Strauss
and says that he doesn't\nunderstand structuralism
because he's too\ndescriptive and synchronic,
post-structuralism was born.
But the one came\nfrom the others.
So I don't know why\nI have to be pure.
You're asking me to be pure.
It should make sense that\nif you want your philosophy
or whatever this\nis supposed to be--
It's not philosophy.
It's not philosophy.
I never said I was\ndoing philosophy.
No.
I never said I was\ndoing philosophy.
And also, Levi Strauss is not\na philosopher and Derrida,
I'm not even sure\nhe's a philosopher.
And de Man is certainly\nnot a philosopher.
They're literary people, and\nI'm an architectural theorist.
And I'm a bad historian,\nbut I'm a very good
architectural theorist.
And I need philosophy,\nbecause I use it.
I don't have to be\ncorrect with it.
I don't have to be.
Well then why should we buy the\nexistence of the deep structure
you describe?
All you've told us is\nthat a lot of these things
seem to look similar.
Where is the deep\nstructure in that?
I mean, they all look\nat each other's stuff.
That's not deep structure.
That's culturally historically\nspecific structure.
We all read Art Daily.
We all look at the\nsame magazines.
Where's the deep\nstructure in that?
I think the attempt was--
as preliminary as it was--
to try to look open mindedly and\nspeculatively of a generation.
They're more than\none generation,
but there is a\ncertain age group that
seem to be sort of\ntrending toward certain new
sensibilities that architecture\nhas not looked at lately.
And we found that\nreally interesting.
And as Andrew said,\nit had assumed
that there was no center.
And we're not\nlooking for a center.
It had been assumed that there\nwas no structure, that people
were just doing their own thing.
And I just don't believe\nthat that's possible
when we live in the same world.
And our response to\nthat world will--
by that the fact that\nwe're in the same world--
will have something in common.
And a biologist and an\narchitect may find common ground
structurally because they\nlive in the same world.
And that's history is based on\nis finding those connections.
So we're just trying to find--
That's the fundamental\npremise about history
that Foucault rejects.
Stop trying to teach me\nlessons about Foucault. OK.
I can use Foucault, and\nI understand Foucault.
I can disagree with Foucault.\nI don't have to use philosophy
as a guidebook.
I don't have to.
But you need to present\narguments for why--
I had half an hour.
Give me more time.
I will.
I need more time.
Why are we getting beat up?
[laughter]
It was a bad lecture.
Thanks for the talk.
So I really love this idea\nof trying to survey the field
and figure out what's going\non, because I think there's
a tendency to say\nso much is going on
that we just have to throw up\nour hands and sort of jump in.
But I think if I\ncould be convinced
that you could survey the field\nand create even like, a Hegel
level master history\nof what's going on,
I would follow you\nthere all the way.
So my question is, if\nwhat you're trying to do
is survey the field, how are\nyou defining the field such
that only the things in this\nexhibition are included?
And I don't want to be\ntoo pointed about it,
but if it is that\nyou're just trying
to sample a kind of\nvanguard that is suggesting
the direction of\nthe history, then
why is it that it's mostly\nthese sort of small, sort
of projectless, sort of\nbourgeois North American
and Western European practices?
Thank you.
It's very bourgeois.
It's very North American.
It's our friends.
Yeah.
No I mean, I think--
it seems to me as though\nmany of the questions
are being launched\nfrom a place that sort
of presumes an infinite and\ninfinitely neutral data set.
And I use the word data\nquite intentionally,
as though we could sort of\nlike, look down from above
on every architectural project\nwithin the last 35 years
and make informed\nselections that
would then result in their\npresence in the gallery.
And I would like to\nposit two things.
I'm not sure that's\na useful exercise.
And secondly,\nthat's certainly not
what we're trying to do at all.
We're trying to construct\na kind of mythos
really out of whole\ncloth that has
a certain kind of\ninterior coherence to it
that is probably more intended\nas a kind of generating
mechanism for reducing the\ncrippling self-consciousness
of young architects as they\nattempt to do more stuff.
More than it is an\nattempt to describe
anything in empirical terms,\nor god forbid, correct terms.
I have no interest in that.
So I would say\nwhat's out there--
well it's A, available,\nintellectually available.
It's B, work where we feel\nquite confident that the GSD has
a kind of generative role in the\ninitiation of certain strands
of thought.
And so we are already a\nkind of bounded system
if we want to take\nthe sort of data view.
Certain agreements\nhave been made
and we're all in this room.
And I think if this isn't an\nentirely accurate reflection
of all of the\npeople in this room,
there are a few lies in there,\nwe hope it's a compelling one.
And the power to compel would\nbe far more important to us
than the kind of accuracy\nof any single move.
Yeah.
What I appreciate is that\na lot of these things that
led to this exhibition--
This is a convergence\nof a lot of things
that the school has in place.
Like Alice, where we first\ntalked about that Wordsworth
passage.
At a symposium,\nthe sort of salon,
that Jennifer and\nAndrew organized
where we first started using\na certain kind of vocabulary.
In the various convergences\nfrom classes, to other lectures,
to visiting critics, to trips.
There's a kind of\nconvergence and an excitement
that the GSD has a way of\nconvening and collecting
that just to amplify\nwhat Andrew just said,
that I hope we can continue.
And move forward again,\nwithout worrying about--
We need to be rigorous.
We need to be accurate.
We need to be rigorous.
But we also need to just\nspeculate and imagine.
And I think that part of what\nthe exhibition is trying to do
is to reward imagining.
And I think it's been really\nenjoyable to talk about it
and work with it.
And thank you all\nso much for coming.
Thanks a lot.
[applause]
