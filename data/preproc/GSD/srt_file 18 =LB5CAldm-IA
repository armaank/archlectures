Welcome to the first lecture of\nthe Department of Architecture
I just met Annabelle Selldorf.
I didn't know her before.
And I am very, very\npleased that she's agreed
to come out come out tonight.
Being a chair that\nis a historian,
a theorist, sometimes we have\na lot of verbal performances,
and a student last\nfall said, Michael,
I really wish we could just\nsee some real architecture.
OK, this is it, right?
This is a force to be reckoned\nwith, real architecture.
Annabelle founded Selldorf\nArchitects in 1988,
in New York.
From the start, it's\nreally interesting
to watch how young firms begin.
From the start, the project that\nmost of us knew her new firm by
was the Neue Gallery,\nnot the Berlin one,
but the New York one.
It was a gallery for\nGerman and Austrian art
in New York, art\nand decorative arts.
And it was a meticulous\nrenovation project,
of historical\nelements, but together,
and sometimes, I think only\narchitects saw this latter,
together with a\nvery demanding need
for complex structural\nsystem, mechanical additions,
and it was bringing those\ntwo things together,
in a single project,\nthat I think
got the attention of the\narchitecture community
of Selldorf Architects.
So that began a kind of\ntheme that continued.
Projects, other projects,\nlike the Clarke Institute,
our Clarke Institute,\nlet's say, in Williamstown,
which Gary Hildebrand worked\nwith Annabelle on the landscape
of that project.
Again, partly restoration of\ngalleries, partly additions.
And that led to a number\nof art related projects
like galleries in New York.
But at the same time, there\nemerged a completely different
kind of work.
And a polarizing--\nsomething that's not really
polarized, but just to make\nthe point of the range,
but the other side\nof the work, which
were industrial\nbuildings, and sometimes
difficult industrial sites.
I don't know if you agree\nwith this kind of way
of telling the story, but\nto me, those two worlds,
a little bit came,\nseemed to come together,
in the David Zwirner\nGalleries, which,
if you didn't know\nthe Neue Gallery,
you couldn't not know the\nDavid Zwirner Gallery.
It was cast in place.
It was also partly renovation,\nbut with a new cast in place,
concrete facade, five\nstories, in Manhattan,
cast in place in Manhattan.
Well, at least, as a finish\nsurface, it's not that easy.
But it was exquisitely done.
And I remember one--
I watched a video of Annabelle\ntalking about that gallery,
and the thing that struck\nme, Annabelle, when you said,
"We did not one thing\nwe didn\'t have to do."
And to me, somehow, that you\ncould almost say that about,
I think, your work, generally.
That there's not one thing--
when you know you\nhave it, is when
not one thing seems like it\nwouldn't have to be there.
And I think that's\nkind of the theme.
Tonight, my\nunderstanding is, we're
going to see newer projects.
The Museum of Contemporary\nArt in San Diego, which
continues this theme of\ngallery, part renovation, part
addition, although this\nis mostly addition.
But then, extremely\ninteresting, the transformation
of some former railway\nyards in our Arles,
France into a\ncontemporary art center.
I'm not saying the San Diego\nproject isn't interesting,
but this transformation\nof the rail yards
is one of those\nmoments, I think.
And if that weren't\nenough, then Sunset
Park, which is a reclamation and\nconstruction of the largest--
is this true, the largest\nmaterial reclamation
center in the United States.
I'm also very pleased\nto announce tonight
that Annabelle will be giving\nan options studio in the fall.
And I'm excited about that.
This is kind of rare, I think,\nso I'm very pleased about that.
And I would end by\njust saying this.
We talk a lot in our\ndepartment about the difficulty
of the thesis project.
And this is something that\ncomes up again and again.
If you're paying\nattention tonight,
there's a design\nthesis, and a lesson,
not only design\nthesis, but a lesson
about how to pursue and\ndevelop a thesis in each
of these projects that\nAnnabelle will show.
From the exhibit of art in\nwell-proportioned spaces,
with the quality of light\nthat has a sort of presence,
but still doesn't\ninterfere with the art,
to how to work with\npre-engineered building
components for the\nlargest material recovery
facility in the United States.
Welcome, Annabelle Selldorf.
[applause]
Hello, everybody.
This introduction was so\nnice, and so complete,
that I don't need to\nsay anything else.
It's actually true.
Well I can fill it\nout, a little bit.
And I'll repeat some things\nthat Michael has said.
Thank you.
I really appreciated that.
I want to tell you a little\nbit about Selldorf Architects
and who we are today\nand who we were then.
Today, we are about 70 people.
We live on Union Square,\nin New York City.
Very lucky spot, this, because\nthere is, three times a week,
a farmer's market.
And if clients get bored, they\ncan go to the farmer's market.
Actually, it's really very\nhealthy living for us,
too, albeit expensive.
But we haven't always been\nthere, at that office.
It's a large space.
It's a big loft space,\nand I love working there.
When we moved there, I realized\nthat having space to work
brings people together in\na completely unique way.
And I look at all of those\nincredible, smart, young,
brilliant, hardworking\npeople in the studio--
And one of the thing\nI'm proudest of
is that they come\nfrom everywhere.
We have amazing\ndiversity in the studio,
and everybody offers\na lot of themselves,
by virtue of the fact that they\nshare where they come from.
And I realized one day\nthat I don't very much
talk about where I am from.
It's pretty evident, I'm\nafraid, that I am German.
And-- what's so funny?
But, 37 years in New York\nhaven't broken my accent yet.
I try to keep it charming.
I know it's not like\nFrench, but anyway.
But I did want to tell\nyou a little bit that,
not only I am from\nGermany, I'm from Cologne.
And I grew up in the '60s.
My father was an architect.
And if you grew up\nin post-war Germany,
you were very familiar\nwith pictures like this.
I am not going to start telling\nyou the story of the Second
World War, but the story of\nutter and almost complete
destruction is something that\nimprints itself in your memory,
even if you weren't there.
I don't know if you know\nmuch about epigenetics,
but it seems to\nbe one such thing.
So rebuilding and\nappreciating old substance,
old buildings, old\nmaterial, is something
that comes almost natural\nto me, because it's
what I was raised with.
And I'm showing you this\npicture, not because I think
there is such marvelous\narchitecture around the Cologne
Cathedral today, but it is,\nby way of talking about what
you see when you grow up,
Cologne was\nextremely haphazardly
rebuilt. With some terrible\n'50s and '60s buildings.
But all the same, they\nwere modernist buildings.
And that modernist tradition,\nand the tradition in Cologne,
of craft and art, are things\nthat are very much in, somehow,
part of my understanding\nof the world.
And so, one of\nthe first projects
I ever did, by the time that\nI had become a practicing
architect in New\nYork, was a gallery
for a famous German art\ndealer, Michael Werner,
in New York City.
It was the first almost\npublic space that I worked on,
and I came by this\nproject a little bit,
almost as a coincidence.
Because the art dealer who\nwanted this gallery said,
I want everything, I just\ndon't want any architecture.
And I thought that\nsuited me just fine.
We never met, until\nmuch, much later.
And he hired me over the phone,\nand asked me the really weird
questions, like how much?
And I was like, really\nnot prepared for this,
because this was the first\nconversation we ever had.
So I said, $10,000?
And I had no idea whether\nthat was a lot or little.
Anyway, he said,\nyeah, OK, but I won't
be available for\nabout six weeks,
because I'm going\non holiday, but I
will be in New York in\nthe middle of August,
and I will come and look\nat the drawings with you.
So he came, and I had literally\nspent the entire summer
in my shirt, at my desk,\nactually, sometimes
not with a shirt,\nbecause it was very hot.
And I had produced\nall these drawings.
And as I was producing\nthese drawings,
I all of a sudden realized,\nwow, I have had no conversation,
everything I'm doing\nis speculative.
What if he doesn't like it?
But it turned out that he\nliked what I had drawn,
we immediately had a\ninteresting dialogue,
and maybe the most\nmemorable moment
was when I showed him an\nelevation of this very door.
Michael pulled out this little\ncrumpled piece of paper,
where he had drawn a door.
And he looked at his, and he\nlooked at mine, and he said,
yours is better.
And with that, we\nestablished a relationship
that lasted a long\ntime, or is still--
he's still a very\ngood friend of mine.
But I give Michael\na lot of credit
for making me look at\nthings, look at architecture,
look at art, think about\nart, think about how art is,
in space.
And this was the first\nart space I ever did.
I knew a lot of artists\nand art dealers,
for some reason or\nanother, in New York,
and they were my\nfriends, almost more
than the architectural\ncommunity.
Because I was educated\nat Pratt, and Pratt
was a very disparate school,\nwhere people didn't necessarily
hang out together all that much.
And so there I was,\nlooking at art,
and lucky, a little\nwhile later, I
was asked to help with the\nrenovation of what is today
the Neue Galerie, the museum\nfor German and Austrian art,
in New York.
And I remember that\nI was quite busy
when I received the call to\ngo look at this building,
and annoyed that I had to make\ntime in my busy, busy day.
But there I was, looking at\nthese Carr re and Hastings
buildings, and thinking\nI'm really glad I kept
the appointment.
And thereafter, for\nsome four or five years,
we worked on the\nrenovation, painstaking,
as Michael has\nalready talked about.
And what I learned was\nthat thinking about space
for a specific kind\nof art, because this
was for German and\nAustrian art, post 1945,
up until the year 2000.
And so looking at an old space\nfor modern art, as it were,
was a specific idea.
So we looked at this section\nand all the possibilities
it would hold, specifically,\nthis amazing skylight
in the middle, that, when we\nsaw the building, at first,
was completely covered up.
And went to work,\nunderstanding that,
despite the fact that this\nbuilding wasn't landmark listed
on the inside, that\nwe wanted to keep
the logic and the\ncirculation of the building.
And of course, you\nunderstand why,
because this magnificent\nstaircase leads
to these very grand spaces.
And when I think\nabout it today, I
don't remember, anymore,\nwhat is new or what is old.
But it is true that we took\nthe building apart, pretty much
completely, before putting\nit back together again.
No, we did nothing to\nthat staircase, mind you,
but a new state of the\nart climate control system
was inserted, a completely\nnew lighting system
is everywhere, and\nthinking about how
to exhibit spaces, objects,\nfurniture, and decorative arts
in the spaces, what\nkind of vitrines,
where pictures would hang.
This particular photo\nlooks rather yellow.
It isn't, in real life, but\nI like looking at this photo,
because making this\nmuseal glass ceiling
in this space, turned to\na domestic space, formerly
domestic space,\ninto something else.
And it brings to\nyou, if you care
to think about it, the\nsimultaneity of when
this building was built, in\nthe style of a French mansion,
together with the time\nof the Vienna Secession.
And there is that\nobvious conflict
and overlap and\ntension, if you will,
that is perfectly beautiful\nto all of us today,
because we are used to looking\nat things in that manner.
But if you think about it,\nall of the historic context
is really rather interesting.
And so it came together that\nall these restoration aspects,
there is a brand\nnew ceiling in here,
with what was, then, 12 years\nago, very progressive lighting,
but also very\npurposeful lighting.
One of the exercises,\nI would say,
was to do just as little\nas you could get away with,
but making it look completely\nnormal, effortless, elegant,
not over restored, and simple.
And so these\nvitrines, for example,
were part and parcel\nof the original design.
Not that we designed these\nvitrines, quite the opposite,
we found them at the Museum\nfor Decorative Arts, in Vienna,
and then realized that they\nactually came from the Victoria
and Albert Museum.
And so they were rebuilt and\nthey fit the space perfectly,
and make a really\ninteresting contrast
to the objects in the\nvitrine by Hoffman and Wagner
and other people.
So the Neue Galerie was an\nimportant project for us.
And it almost naturally\nled to a series
of other art related projects.
Here, we're showing you a\nplan, a map, of West Chelsea.
And indicated in\nred, not in white,
that would be too many\nbuildings, in red,
are buildings and\nprojects that we've
worked on over the course\nof the last 10 years,
as West Chelsea has become a\nvery prominent art district.
And I'm only going\nto show you, really--
if I use the right thing--
only one project.
That building that you see there\nwas a garage, a three story
garage, and David\nZwirner, a good friend
and old client of mine,\ncalled just at the moment
when I had truly nothing else\nto do, in 2008, and said,
guess what, I bought a building.
And I want to build a new\nbuilding that is better
than a museum, because I\nwant to show my artists
under ideal conditions.
And nobody really knows how to\ndo that, I know how to do that.
And he didn't mean\nme, he meant himself.
And I will give him credit,\nbecause I really think he did,
and he does, and he has\nvery, very specific ideas,
and we've worked together\non so many projects that
were sort of in code\nlanguage with one another.
And fast forward a\ncouple of years later,
this cast in place\nstructure sits discretely,
but, I think, powerfully\non West 20th Street.
And as the design\ndeveloped, the idea
of making a building that\nsits in the street wall,
that communicates with\nthe surrounding buildings
that are, in all\nlikelihood, going to stay,
in a very, very, very much\nchanging neighborhood.
So the idea of having this\nrelationship to the neighboring
buildings, by utilizing\npunched windows,
and making that part and\nparcel of the relationship
in the street.
But what also\nevolved was the idea
of using cast in place concrete.
And I often say that\none of the nicest things
about getting older is that\nyou have more experience.
I had no experience doing\ncast in place concrete.
And I foolishly thought,\nwell, what's the big deal?
We learned.
And it took some time to learn\nthat it's just complicated.
In New York City, as\nMichael already alluded to,
you may wonder why\nthat's complicated.
It's just because the trade\nis very much controlled
by a small group of people\nwho have very little interest
in developing technology.
It's very expensive, and\nyou're subject to basically
a rigged system.
But I had heard about that,\nlike the famous concrete boots,
but didn't really think\nthat that would actually
be a problem.
Turned out that it\nwasn't a problem,
but it was a lot of work.
And so a little bit\nmore about concrete,
later, but here\nabout the building.
It's, like I said, a five\nstory building in the street,
but it is shaped in an "L" form.
And the largest space,\nthe heart of the matter,
is right in the middle of it.
And the building is L-shaped\nbecause of that large space,
and because that large space\nwanted to have skylights.
Lighting with natural\ndaylight is something
that I feel is extremely\nimportant for the viewing
of art.
But it is simply\nindispensable, as far
as David Zwirner is concerned.
And so here is the plan that\nvery quickly indicates how
this square site is organized.
What's indicated in red are the\nexhibition spaces, and in blue,
is the circulation place.
So I think, even without\nstudying this plan
in a lot of detail, I\nthink what you can see
is how tightly it is organized.
And how few elements get\nyou through the building.
It's only the ground floor\nand the second floor that
are open to the public, but\nthere are showrooms and offices
on the floors above.
And this staircase, that\nyou see to the right,
winds itself through\nthe entire building,
as you will see in a moment.
So one of the things\nthat was important to us
was to create an\ninteresting section.
Here are the skylights,\nnorth facing skylights,
that I talked about.
We experimented a great deal\nwith how to maximize daylight,
how to simply never have\nhotspots on the floor,
is something that\nbecomes a little bit
of a pet peeve of mine.
And it's very interesting\nand very beautiful
when all the research works.
There is-- Oops, sorry.
Back.
Hm, it won't go back.
It does go back.
There is our green\nroofs everywhere,
super efficient\nair conditioning,
natural ventilation, lots of\nday and light, bicycles galore,
and a good staircase\nto walk up and down.
And so this is probably the\nfirst commercial art gallery,
of this size, that\nhas lead gold label.
And that was important\nto David, of course,
it's important to us.
But very rarely are clients\nwilling, and especially
for a commercial building, to\ngo through the extra effort
that it takes.
But it made sense\nhere, because we
think that sustainability has to\nbe something that is practical,
that's part of your thinking,\nand so I'm particularly
proud that we put\nthis very, very
simple, these simple\nconcepts into action.
But this drawing, of\ncourse, is also there
to describe what that\nsection looks like.
You have a relatively thin\nspace along the street,
and then wrapping around the\ntall space, in an L-shape.
And so now, here, you\nsee what that building
looks like in the street.
Obviously, it's making\nthe street wall,
but it's distinct\nin its materiality,
and I appreciate that at\ndifferent times of the day,
the way the light is\nreflected on the concrete
is really quite beautiful.
And here, just a couple of\npictures of all the efforts
we went through\nwith the concrete.
We hired a consultant\nwho has done
a lot of wonderful buildings\nin and around America,
and probably in the world, who\ncame out of IM Pei's office.
And his name is Reg Hoff, and\nhe is an elderly gentleman
who was just as\nenthusiastic about creating
mockups and understanding\ncolor and so on as we were.
And somewhere off site, we\ndid all of these mock ups,
we hired a different company,\nthat wasn't a union company.
And we decided very\nquickly that we really
had to define\nabsolutely everything.
Like what kind of board\nform would we use.
There were boards of\na particular length,
they were cedar boards,\npine boards, sorry.
And they were stacked\nin a particular fashion.
So that as you look\nat the building,
you will realize that there\nis a strongly articulated wood
pattern on the facade,\nbut it is very regular.
And so it never feels\nmessy, as it were.
And here it is by\nnight, of course.
In the evening, the\nbuilding glows beautifully,
especially on one of the\nfirst exhibitions-- oop, no,
I'm meant to talk about\nsomething else here--
concrete goes on, because,\nas this drawing shows,
we wanted to demonstrate that\nthe architecture is not just
a facade, but that the\nbuilding is, literally,
a concrete building.
And so we carried one\narchitectural motif
into the staircase, and that\nis really rather exciting,
because it goes very tall.
And the way light is\nreflected in that staircase
is pretty nice.
It was also a strong\ndesire to make
that staircase,\nand that concrete,
just as thin as possible.
And we showed everybody\nthose photographs
of Le Corbusier's stair at\nLatourette, and there you go.
I'm not going to go on showing\nyou more Corbusier pictures.
But I am very proud\nthat we worked
with the structural engineer\nuntil, finally, they
relented, and allowed us to have\na very thin stringer winding
itself through the building.
The large span exhibition\nspace was, among other,
designed for\nRichard Cera, and it
was one of my proudest moments,\nwhen he opened his show,
and he came by, and he\nsaid, "good building."
That's pretty much better\nthan anything, right?
But any art looks\ngreat in this space.
And by now, there have been\nso many different exhibitions.
Here is Dan Flavin,\nand I've always
loved what that looks like.
And here is another picture of\nthe staircase winding itself,
and dropping you off\non the second floor,
where there is a very\ndifferent kind of exhibition
space, that's very\nwell-suited for drawings
and smaller works of art.
It gets a different kind of\nday lighting from the side.
And it is really\nimportant to me,
and was to David, as well,\nto say this is not just
a building for public visitors,\nbut it is a building for all
of the people who work here.
I think there are some 60 people\nwho work in the building today.
And finally, just a\nview out the window,
across to the Hudson River.
Speaking of water, across the\nocean, in the south of France.
Now, here, is the project that\nMichael mentioned earlier,
the Luma Arles.
It's an art foundation.
An art foundation that is\ndedicated to contemporary art
and to experimental contemporary\nart performances, music,
projects of all different kinds.
And long before we came onto the\nscene, Frank Gehry was there,
and he was hired by Mya Hoffman,\nwho is the patron of the Luma
foundation, to build a\nbuilding that would counteract
the very beautiful and very\ntight historic center of Arles.
Just to explain this\na little bit further,
the location of the Parc\ndes Atelier is, I think,
it's six hectares of\nan industrial area,
where the French\nrailways, at one time,
fabricated locomotives\nand repaired train cars.
And all of these buildings\nare existing buildings.
They're in red, because\nthose are the buildings
that we're working on.
But this is called\nthe Grande Halle.
And it's been there.
And this building is also there.
And right here is\nFrank Gehry's tower.
It's not really, strictly\nspeaking, a tower,
but it comes--
it presents itself as\na rather tall building,
because one of the things that\nis very difficult to describe
in drawings is that\nthere is a seven meter
drop between this\nformer industrial area
and the Boulevard where\nGehry's building is
raised on top of the Boulevard.
And here, you see these\nindustrial buildings,
they are shed buildings.
They have overhead lights.
They have a very\nsimple structure,
a sort of slightly\nclassical elevation
or facade system, that was built\nat the turn of the century.
And-- oops, sorry, back one.
And what you see, again, are\nthe roofs of the two buildings
that we have already renovated.
In the far building--
damn, I'm not very\ngood at this--
in the far building,\nright here, you
see an addition that we put\nonto this building, which
is called the mechanic, which\nserves an exhibition space
to create a much larger span.
And now this is a little\nbit of an impression.
This project is still\nunder construction.
So there is a park yet to come.
[inaudible] from Brussels, is\nthe talented landscape designer
who's working with all of us\nto create a park, that is,
a garden park, that is\nliterally an amenity for all
of the people in Arles.
And that is really the\ngrand and wonderful idea
behind this project, is that\nthe conversion of this factory,
that left many people without\nwork when the factory closed,
is bringing a totally different\npurpose, a cultural center,
to Arles, that will inspire\nthe city, I would say,
during all times of the year.
Right now, Arles a\nlittle bit deserted
during the winter months, even\nthough it's quite beautiful.
But little by little,\nthere is life in this place
that you can see here,\nin the summertime.
And I feel that the\nrenovation that we did,
is it really a renovation?
Well there was an exterior\nshell to these buildings,
but everything else is new.
It was suited my idea of,\nagain, doing just as little
as possible.
But while you were\ndoing very little,
staying busy, paying attention\nto everything, all the time.
And so even the open\ncourtyard, the area that is not
roofed over, that is used\nfor a cafe, and people coming
together, has this visible\nstructure that very carefully
supports the facades.
And then the stealth\nbomber behind.
And this was sort of an\ninteresting development,
as well, because it was\nvery clear to us, when
we were adding this\npart of the building
to the regular shed\nroofs, that it had
to kind of be the same shape.
And it was all about creating\na structure on the outside that
allowed us to have column-free\nspace on the inside,
but we didn't want it to\nlook just exactly the same.
And at one time,\nthere had been a fire,
so this end wall,\nthat was over here,
was actually just a very\nsimple, primitive CMU unit.
And so I quite like that\nindustrial vocabulary,
and we played\naround with choosing
different concrete units.
And then somebody\ncame along and said,
well, there are those really\nbeautiful ink black CMU units,
and very quickly, the\nstealth bomber was born.
But there are elements that you\nfind around the south of France
that bring shade\nto the passer by,
that very much create\na kind of atmosphere
and a relationship with a\nplace that I always think
is very important.
And this is what these spaces\nlook like on the inside.
Pretty much the same\nstructure, as it was.
Skylights were rearranged\nto, again, keep the sun away
from the walls.
But overall, it just\nfeels like it was always
meant to be this way.
And it's very flexible for\ndifferent kinds of use,
for art exhibitions,\nthis was this show
was designed by Philippe Rand,\nwho I think you all know.
And his idea about\nlaying out the space
was very, very different from\nmy angular vision of the world,
but I was very pleased to\nsee that it worked just
beautifully, and the\ndifferent kinds of concepts
are possible in the space.
A picture of a building\nthat is under construction.
We're completely\nreconfiguring a building
that is called the\n[? fauxmasion, ?] where
we have rehearsal space and\na CLT wood, double story,
dormitory.
And that's, for me, quite fun.
I don't have very good\npictures to show you.
This is the upstairs\nrehearsal space,
with refurbished wooden trusses\nand a new climate system.
All very, very simple, but\nallowing natural ventilation,
when necessary, daylight, if\nyou want it, not if you don't.
But the dormitory\nspace is on the floor
below, and is basically a\nstructure within a structure.
Two floors of cross laminated\ntimber, dormitory bedrooms
and on top of one another.
And like I said, it's\nunder construction,
so I can't show you very\nmuch, but it's quite exciting,
because they are very\nsimple little spaces.
Now in a more Western\ndirection, the Museum
of Contemporary Art in\nSan Diego is a project
that we hope is going\ninto construction sometime
later this year.
It's a museum that started\nwith a building of house,
really, by Irving Gill.
I think it was built\nin 1928, or something
like that, I can't\nremember the date.
But Irving Gill\nis responsible for
this proto-modern architecture\nin La Jolla that I simply love,
because it's so\nsimple and so elegant.
And he talked about simplicity,\nsincerity, and serenity.
And I always thought\nthose were good mottoes,
and I'd like to pass\nthem on as my own.
But this house, belonged\nto two Elizabeths Scripps.
You may have heard of\nthe Scripps Institute,
and the Scripps family\nwas very instrumental
in Southern California.
She had this house\nbuilt by Irving Gill
and would do her calisthenics\nout here on the balcony
every morning.
But when she died, she left the\nbuilding to an art foundation,
and it became the first\nart museum in La Jolla.
And over time, different people\nadded to it, most recently,
Robert Venturi did\na little addition,
that you can see right here.
He is also responsible\nfor this space here,
and these rather enormous\ncolumns that cover up
the Irving Guill building.
And then there's a little\ncafe space over here.
It turned out that Bob\nVenturi's addition did not
offer the amount of gallery\nspace the museum needed.
In fact, there is no\ngallery space at all,
except all the space\nthat was already
there in the Gill building.
And so when we, happily,\nwon a small competition
for this project, we were tasked\nwith maximizing gallery space.
And that is what we're doing.
Here is a picture\nfrom the ocean side.
And I think I didn't\nreally explain to you
how incredibly spectacular\nthis building is,
in terms of where it's located.
Because it looks\nout on the ocean.
And competing with the Pacific\nOcean is it very difficult.
But it became clear that\nyou had to somehow make
the views your friend,\nand not your enemy.
Simply, you wouldn't win.
But also, this is a\nvery fragile landscape.
It wasn't very\neasy to find space.
We have to dig into\nthe hill, and getting
permits is extremely\ndifficult. But in the process,
what we're proposing\nis converting
what was the auditorium\ninto big gallery space.
You see some\nskylights over here,
and we're working out\nhow to keep the light out
of the building, rather\nthan bringing too much
light into the building, because\nSouthern California light is
intense.
And so that's quite a task.
But anyway, so\nhere is the remnant
of the Venturi building.
This is the original\nGill building.
And then there is a\n[? marshall ?] [? dwyer, ?]
architects from San Diego,\naddition that remains
in the back.
In fact, I think\nit's quite important
to think of this\nbuilding, when it is all
finished, as something\nthat has evolved to being
what it is going to be.
Part of the renovation is to\ngive the building a real front
entrance, which it\ndoesn't have right now.
Currently, you enter through\nthis courtyard, on the side,
here.
If you're able to make it\npast the columns, which
we have removed here.
But the new entrance is a little\nbit more prominent along here.
Like I said, the auditorium will\nbe converted to gallery space,
and then there is a\nconnection with a bar
building on the south\nside of the building,
and here is a\ntrapezoidal gallery
that I think of\nas a garden court.
And you can see, in this\nplan, without studying it
a lot, that not only are we\nadding a lot of gallery space,
but we are also marrying\nthese very odd geometries.
And as a kind of\ndescription of process,
I think for the\nteam, and myself,
in the office, what\nwe are working on
is always circulation.
Like if you create a\ncirculation that works well,
everything else kind\nof falls into place.
If you're able to proportion\nspaces and direct the light
properly.
So again, the idea is\nthat this addition, that
is slightly larger than\nthe rest of the building,
will feel completely natural.
And there it is.
The materials are\nstucco, and there's
a little bit of travertine\nright here on the building,
where you simply can't help but\ngive a nod to Louis Kahn's Salk
Institute.
And if you've never been\nthere, to me, that was really
one of the most incredible\nexperiences, the first time
I went.
And so, since then, every\ntime, when I go to San Diego,
I pay a little visit and have\na moment of utter inspiration,
I guess.
Some simple images\nof the galleries.
There is always a little\nconnection to daylight.
They have a wonderful collection\nof Southern California art.
And what has been left,\nreally in quite a mess,
is the rear elevation,\nfacing the ocean.
So what we're trying to do is\nwe're trying to sort of marry
these very odd\ngeometries in such a way
that they become places\nfor people to gather,
that incorporate the\nsculpture garden in such a way
that you can actually feel as\nif you are climbing up the hill,
through the building, and I\nthink that'll be quite nice.
We've done quite a few\nresidential buildings
over the years.
And just quickly, I\nwanted to show you
a house that is actually\none, two, three, five houses
that we have\ncompleted this summer,
that I think is one of the\nnicest houses I've worked on.
First of all, Chilmark,\nin Martha's Vineyard,
is a marvelous place.
And if you've ever\nbeen, you would
know that there are all\nthese marvelous stone walls.
There is a really\ngreat history of--
they're not even masons\nbecause most of these
are stone walls without border.
Anyway, an artist friend of mine\nbought this property and said,
well, what are we going to do?
There was a very old\nhouse on the property that
had a horrible addition to it.
There was a remnant of\nan old barn over here.
And then there were these funny\nlittle cottages over there.
And we started to\nplay around, and tried
to create some relationship,\nand eventually,
we realized that\non the site, there
was one spot that\nfelt like, from there,
you could see everything.
Because this field, of course,\nis totally spectacular,
and we proceeded to say\ntake the old house apart.
This is the oldest house\non Martha's Vineyard,
I believe, and\nrebuild, with drawings
that we found in the\nhistoric archive, a barn,
just as it was at one time.
And that was really\nquite fun, to understand
how the structure\nwent, and Ken Ordinsen
was the structural engineer,\nand he got quite excited
about making a building all of\nwood, with a solid exterior.
But the piece de\nresistance is a glass house
that's made entirely of wood.
There's no steel in it.
It's quite large,\nbut not so large.
It's sort of a glorified\none bedroom house.
But because the site\nis so uniquely located,
with literally no\nroads around it,
and this big old field\nthat I showed you before,
doing an all glass house\nseemed entirely appropriate.
And here, just\nquickly, is a plan.
Obviously, no walls\ntouching the exterior.
And it's simple.
Simple, simple, simple.
But incredibly lovely.
The proportions are great, you\ncouldn't build higher than 13
feet, but that worked just\nbeautifully for these rooms.
The floor is all travertine.
It was really fun to do,\nto work on this house.
And there it sits\nin the landscape.
It's actually, from\nvarious points,
you feel that you\nhardly see it at all.
But when you are inside, it is\ntruly a wonderful experience
of nature.
Like I said, we\njust finished it,
so we don't have that\nmany photographs of it.
But there was a\nvery conscious idea
about using a material that\nwould deteriorate a little bit
over time, like travertine\ndoes a beautiful thing when
it's exposed to the elements.
And that notwithstanding,\nthere were many conversations
like, you're not\ngoing to sue us,
right, if it just cracks\nafter the first season?
I'm going to try\nto hurry it along,
I think I brought maybe\ntoo many projects.
This, I want to show you.
Two apartment buildings\nthat we've designed,
and that have recently\nbeen completed.
This is number 10 Bond Street, a\ncorner side on Lafayette Street
and Bond Street.
And I've looked, because I\nlive in the neighborhood,
at this parking lot\nfor many, many years.
And when the\ndeveloper came to us,
and had finally secured the\nrights to build this building,
we understood that we\nhad to present this
to landmarks, because\nthe neighborhood is
a landmark neighborhood.
And after a lot\nof back and forth,
we built this building,\nwhich is entirely
clad with terracotta, a material\nthat I like a great deal.
Because, for one, it's been\naround for a very long time.
Wherever you go in\nthe United States,
or anywhere really,\nterracotta is
a material that is malleable,\nthat can receive a glaze.
And I enjoyed playing with\nthat, because in some ways,
we felt that we\nwanted to build a very
modern, very,\ntransparent building,
but we wanted it to relate\nto the neighborhood,
both in color, as well as\nin proportion, as it were.
Essentially, every floor has\ntwo loft-like apartments.
With a great deal of glazing\naround them, right here.
They're very\ncomfortable apartments.
They\'re tall ceilings, I\nthink they\'re 10\' 6" ceilings.
Open kitchens, and\nso on and so forth.
And the reason why I\nam talking about that
is because a good\nplan is a good plan.
And I take a great deal of\npride in saying that everything
we do emanates from a plan.
That includes the\nstructure, that
thinks about how you distribute\nyour climate control,
but a good plan means that you\nknow how people move in space,
what dimensions are all about.
And I think it can\nnever be said enough
that the difference of an inch,\noftentimes, is what makes--
well, maybe not an\ninch, maybe two inches,
but understanding dimensions,\nboth human dimensions,
as well as spatial dimensions,\nand how we move around,
is, I think, vital\nto architecture.
So this photo I\nlike a little bit,
because it shows you\nwhat the context is.
There is obviously a\nrelationship between the cast
iron architecture to the south.
And color-wise,\nmaterially, there
is a relationship to\nbuildings to the North,
that are red and brown brick.
And it was a little\nbit of an adventure
to use these very large\npieces of terracotta,
and we wanted to show\nyou this picture,
because you can see how much\ncolor variation there was.
Obviously, we said\nno to this mock up.
But it wasn't easy\nfor the company that
produces the terracotta,\nthey're called Boston Valley,
and they are located in Buffalo.
Buffalo or Rochester,\nnow I can't remember.
But they worked very hard at\ngetting the color of the glaze
just right, and for me, it's\nsuch an immense pleasure
to see how the luster on\nthe glaze works in daylight,
and at different\ntimes of the day,
different parts of\nthe shaped pieces
catch the light differently.
And then, this rather\nlovely opportunity
to create a corner\nwindow that really
adds a great deal of\natmosphere to the apartment.
Another corner condition for a\nbuilding of quite similar size,
on Crosby street\nand Broom streets.
Again, a parking\nlot that developers
had tried to purchase for\nyears and years and years,
and finally, when we got\nit, we realized that, too,
was heavily landmarked.
And we had to convince\nlandmarks to let
us build a slightly\ntaller building
than the adjacent buildings.
And we played, again, with the\nvocabulary of the cast iron
buildings in the district.
I quite like the layered facade.
It's all stainless steel,\nwith these very slender lalli
columns on the outside,\nthat are not structural.
And again, a two apartment per,\nor two lofts per floor, layout.
They're extremely\nluxurious, but I
was happy to find that\nthe developer allowed
us to build a building that\nhas very, very nice quality.
And I think it is, at once,\nquite sophisticated, quite
modern, it has exterior shading,\nwhich reduces the energy
cost a great deal.
And when you do exterior\nshading on buildings in America,
they think that you've\njust invented the wheel.
But in Europe,\nthat's quite common.
But it is very effective, too.
And so we played with that--
whoops, sorry.
One more back.
Maybe we'll just keep going.
Because you can see the layering\nof the building, right there.
There is these little glass\nbalconies, behind them,
doors that open completely.
So that in nice weather, you get\na lot of natural ventilation.
And again, I think that the\nplay between the cast iron
architecture surrounding\nit works very nicely
for the building.
And this is a rear yard, where\nthere is a lot of garden work.
This is actually quite\na beautiful space,
because it feels very intimate.
And here are some views of\nan apartment in the building.
I loves these\nspaces, because you
feel that you get a very good--
you're sort of part\nof the neighborhood.
And now, the Sunset Park\nmaterial recovery facility,
SIMS, as we call\nit, is a project
that's now been finished for,\nI think, four or five years.
And when we applied\nfor the commission,
in a small competition,\nwe got very excited
about doing something\nthat had to do
with urban infrastructure.
This project is\nprominent, and was
very much on Mayor\nBloomberg's mind, when
they assigned the\nsite to a partner,
a private public partnership.
Because they wanted--\nthis was the first
of many projects following\nthat reinvigorated the New York
waterfront.
It was, at one time, an empty\npier that was dedicated to--
what do you call that?
Police--
Evidence.
Evidence recovery.
So the first time\nI went to the site,
there were all these\ncars parked there,
and when you went\nup close to them,
you saw bullet holes here and\nthere, every once in a while,
a trickle of blood.
That was pretty exciting.
But you can see what a\nspectacular sight it is.
I mean, you see New York,\nthe skyline of Manhattan,
over here.
This is the Statue of Liberty.
And what you don't see,\nover here, is a prison.
And so I knew nothing\nabout recycling,
but nor did anybody else.
And more often than not,\nthese kinds of projects
are handled by engineers.
And we worked, of\ncourse, with an engineer,
and they treated us\njust like little girls
like to be treated.
And it didn't take very long\nuntil we changed engineers.
The fun part was, really,\nto think about the master
planning of it.
It was, in some ways, a\nlittle bit prescriptive,
because, located on\na pier, the building
had to work with\nbarge deliveries,
so we knew that all the\ncleaning of the waterway
had to happen on the\nsouthern end of the pier.
So barges come in here, we'll\nshow you a little diagram
of that later on.
But what it meant is that\nthe main part of the building
was over here.
Then the planning of\nthe rest of the site,
including this little garden\narea, and the structure where
we put education and\nadministration together,
all of that was\nsomething that we
developed with an idea\nin mind that each--
that the buildings\nwould function to one
another in such a way that\nthey created these courtyards.
That there was a kind of\npromenade through the side.
And despite the fact that this\nis not a very ceremonial place,
with large garbage trucks\nbarreling down the road,
it still feels like a\ncalm and organized space.
And at the top end\nhere-- well, what you see
is the tipping building,\nthe processing building,
and the bale building.
And they function\ntogether in such a way
that lots of material\nis dropped off here.
It then is processed in\nhere, and baled and picked
up again over here.
And so it's a little\nbit of a circle.
There is also a\nrailway coming in here,
cars are being\nweighed over there.
And all this other\ntraffic there.
I could have just shown you\nthat traffic diagram right away,
but I decided to try to\nexplain it differently.
Well, railway, trucks, and then\nhere, this is civilian traffic.
This round about is there for\nbuses to drop of visitors,
because there is an\neducation center over here.
But then there is\nalso a pedestrian path
along there, which I think is\none of the loveliest things,
because you look\nout on the water,
and you experience\na bit of the garden.
And that seems to be a\nlittle bit of an anachronism,
of course, in this\nindustrial neighborhood,
but it really makes\na huge difference.
And the scale and\nthe proportions
of this recycling facility, of\ncourse, are rather enormous.
And we realized that our usual\ndrawing techniques weren't
so good, because if you drew a\nbuilding to quarter inch scale,
it would take up\nthis entire room.
So I realized that I had\nto think about detailing
a little bit differently.
But after a while,\nyou sort of understood
that it is the big\nstructural things that
would have the most prominent\nreading in the building.
It's entirely constructed in\nthis pre-engrineered steel.
And what we did is we turned\nthe vertical elements outside,
so as to give the\nrhythm of the steel
some expression on the outside.
All of the cladding, I'll\ntell you about that later.
Here's an image of the inside\nof the tipping building,
from the river side,\nor from the waterside,
rather, where you can\nsee how the material is
being craned into the tipping\nbuilding from the barges.
This is a view of the\nprocessing building.
And I would like to take\ncredit for constructing
this kind of a machine,\nbut we were only
in charge of the container.
It's pretty fascinating, because\nI watched quite closely how
the design of this\ndeveloped, and there
are very many opticals orders,\nand there is a great deal
of safety concerns.
Safety first is\nthe lesson learned,
and it used to be that in\nthese recycling facilities,
there were a lot of people\nsorting things by hand,
and that is no longer the case.
But you want to be sure that\npeople who do work there,
who control the machines,\nand who look after things,
are under a very strong,\nvery strict protocol
to maintain safety.
Recycling meant as many\nsustainability sustainable
aspects to the\nproject as possible.
So there is one of the largest\nsolar roof installations
in New York available.
And it's the first\nwindmill that New York City
allowed after, I think, five\nyears of permitting process.
They had never seen\na windmill before.
Just a couple of quick images,\nshowing how this works.
There's many, many,\nmany schoolchildren
come every day,\ndelivered in buses,
go this path, with recycled\nglass on the side right here.
They go to the Education\nCenter, and then they
can go up and across a\nbridge to go right here,
to see recycling in process.
And it creates a great\ndeal of excitement.
It's quite noisy,\nbut fun to watch.
And certainly fun to watch\nfrom a safe distance.
The recycling-- the\nEducation Center
itself, I think,\nis pretty wonderful
for children and adults,\nbecause it tells you
all about the\nevolution of materials
and how they perform in\nthe recycling process.
And we always like to show\nthese pictures of it's all--
the entire building is covered\nwith corrugated metal, that's
called febrile.
It is a slightly corroded,\nand very weather resistant,
corrugated material.
And I love it, because the\nway it reflects the light
and responds to\nnature is something
that never ceases to amaze you.
And you don't have to pay a lot\nof attention to the material,
but truly enjoy the\nmagnificent sky and water
and weather around you.
We decided to show you all\nof the dramatic pictures that
have come to us over time.
Finally, I quickly\nwant to show you
a school that we're\nworking on in Zambia,
and that we're\nvery, very proud of.
A friend of mine won a prize\nto deliver bicycles in Zambia.
And he went there\ndelivering bicycles,
and he said, that's\nthe wrong strategy.
We should build schools,\nnot deliver bicycles.
Because kids who\ndrive on bicycles
to school over\nlong distances are
in grave danger of being\nbarreled over by truck traffic.
And so he built a\nschool, and hired--
not hire, asked a friend of\nmine to provide the design.
And they built a school\nthat's called [? chipokata. ?]
And we are building the\nsecond school, the Mwabwindo
school, which is some five miles\naway from the other school.
And it was important to\nus to do it in such a way
that all of the materials\nwere readily available.
The idea is that there is\na big shade tent that gives
you cover from the extreme sun.
There is a kind of idea about\ndeveloping a little community
for the teacher\nhousing over here.
There's a community\ngarden, a big soccer field,
and a variety of other\ncommunal activities over here.
Like there's a big open\nspace, in this corner.
And one of the things\nabout building this school,
some 180 primary school\nkids come together here,
is that as much as it\nis about education,
it's also about inspiration.
About fostering\na communal sense,
making sure that\neverybody in the community
is welcome here, that learning--\nin the afternoon, that you
can use the art space\nand the library space.
And the building of it\nwas all done locally,
so to that end, the\nclassrooms and other spaces
are all built with local bricks.
We bought a brick\nmaking machine,
it's a non fired brick.
And so there is education,\nand there is creation
of employment at the same time.
And over here is a big mural\nthat the artist Rashid Johnson
is going to do when\nthe building is ready.
And so there is a great deal of\nexcitement of different people
coming together.
And I am delighted with this.
Here you see some pictures of--
they sent samples of\nthe clay and asked us,
did we like this\nclay, or did we want
them to dig someplace else\nfor a different kind of clay?
I think it's particularly\nfascinating that it just
is from right there.
And it turns out that they're\ndoing just an exquisite job,
and everybody is really excited\nto learn how to do this.
And then the rest of the\ntime, they play around.
They play soccer, and\nthey're very good at it.
And this is really\nthe last picture.
Just to say that one of\nthe things that keeps me
off the streets these\ndays is that we're
working on a renovation and\nrestoration of the Frick
Collection in New York.
And I hope that\nyou'll invite me back
and I can tell\nyou more about it.
Thank you.
[applause]
Will you allow for some\nquestions or comments?
Yes, of course.
I apologize for having\ntalked for so long.
No, we have time.
So Annabelle is going to accept\nsome comments or questions.
But let me, if I may, start.
So I knew, obviously, your\nwork before I knew you.
I always looked at it, I often\nthought of Meis van der Rohe,
but I thought of Meis, what\nI would call, his taste.
And by that, I mean an\nacute sense of proportion,
but an understanding of\nmaterials, but also this--
and I don't know\nhow you guys do it,
you designer guys,\nan understanding
of what the material will do\nwhen it's actually in place.
And maybe even after\nit, as you were
talking about the travertine,\nafter it weathers,
after it ages.
And what I mean by taste is\npartly that ability, and partly
the proportions, which\nI associate often, too,
with decorators\nwho curate and put
materials and form in place,\nbut they're doing it full scale.
They're working more\nlike a sculptor.
They're doing it full scale.
And they can see it and\ntest it and move it around,
whereas the architect can't.
I was struck that--
and I looked very, very\nclosely at Meis's drawings,
because Mies has a way of, it\nseems, representing to himself,
at least, what that thing is,\nwhat it will look like when
it's built, but the\nsketches he does
don't look like the buildings.
They're his way of\nexploring for himself.
Remember when we were\noutside with Lisa
looking at this\nexhibition, and I
was explaining some of how some\nof the projects were produced,
and Lisa Green referred to some\nof them as digital doodles.
The idea being\nthat architects now
are finding digital ways\nof sketching that won't
necessarily look like--
it doesn't look like what\nthe building looks like,
but it's a way of somehow\nrepresenting to yourself what
the building is going to do.
It's a long set\nup, but my question
is, I was struck that your\ndrawings-- because you're
presenting them to clients,\nso they necessarily
are conventional,\nthey're explanatory,
they're very almost didactic.
How do you represent\nto yourself?
What's the process?
Do you do full scale mock ups?
Do you just-- is it\nall in your head?
How do you represent to yourself\nwhat that corner window is
going to be, what the\nlight coming off the water
and hitting the\ncorrugated facade
and how do you calculate\nthe way water, sky,
and corrugation\nis going to behave
at 4:30 in the afternoon?
I mean, I just don't know how\nyou get there from the drawings
that you showed.
It's nice question.
First of all, I relate very much\nto what you say about Mies van
der Rohe, because I\nthink, in a funny way,
his drawings were something\nI could understand.
I always felt a kinship,\nlike yeah, I get this,
I know what he's doing.
And one doesn't have\nthat was every architect.
I am far from being so conceited\nas to compare myself to Meis,
but he does come from\na similar area as I do,
and he did have a similarly\nwicked sense of humor.
But I truly mean that.
I think that the thing that\nI've always admired about Meis
is that in his work, there\nis a sort of humanist quality
that is predicated on\nunderstanding where
we come from, and\nwhere we've been,
and how we've sat in chairs.
And when you look at his\nhouse in Bernau, so much of it
has to do with how\nit's furnished.
And it's this radical,\namazing house that
does so many different things.
It's an it's an experience of\nmodern architecture in the best
way that I can think of.
But what I was trying\nto say is that the way
he does these drawings,\nthey are a way of doing this
for himself, to create\na narrative, to let
your hand say, then you sit\nhere, and then you do that.
One doesn't have that\nwith every architect.
I don't think everybody\nrelates to Meis the way I do,
and I don't know\nwhere that comes from.
I look at Korb's drawings,\nand they are fascinating,
they're beautiful,\nthey're incredible.
But they're somebody\nelse's drawings,
and they're somebody\nelse's thought process.
And so our process is very\nmuch how we think in drawings.
And I would say that\nI lead that process,
but it is one that we all engage\nin, and something gets started,
and then somebody else thinks\nabout it, and we come back.
It's this sort of\niterative process.
I can only draw with pencil,\nI cannot draw with a computer.
And I think I was very\nsmart in not learning
that, because one day, it\nwill be so simple, that I
will have saved myself all that\ntime in learning how to draw.
But it is actually,\nin a funny way,
useful, because it puts me in\nthe role of a different kind
of communicator.
And it supports that\niterative process,
of sketching over\nthings and saying, well,
we're thinking about this, which\nis really very, very rough.
And then it gets refined, and\nthen it goes back and forth
and back and forth.
And it forces you to talk to\neach other within the office.
But you asked about how\nwe deal with clients.
And I think that,\ntoo, in a way, I
like the idea that the\nprocess is a little bit fluid.
We come prepared with\nthings and ideas,
but we make meetings,\nturn meetings,
into workshops, because\nI think that you have
to hear where people come\nfrom and what they want
and how they work.
And so it provides the fluidity.
Other questions or comments.
I have-- Just wait for the mic.
Your expansion in\nSan Diego, I never
thought about how silly the\nentrance of interior design
was, until I saw\nwhat you were doing.
Because it was a\nridiculous entrance.
What's going to happen\nto the Axline Court,
because that used\nto be the lobby?
What are you going to do\nthere, or what will happen?
I've thought about\nthat very hard.
It's like a very\ncomplicated thing,
because it was only the\nentrance, and so it wasn't very
useful to look at\nart in that place,
because these giant\ncolumns inside.
It's not even very\ngood to receive people,
because if you do a little talk,\nthen people have to like that.
So after a lot of deliberation,\nand a real commitment
to making sure that it stays,\nI don't like Axline Court,
I don't think it's a great\npiece of architecture,
but it is part and\nparcel of a history
and an evolution of\nthis institution.
And I respect it.
I respect a lot of the\nthinking that went on
in the course of the design.
But I want to give it purpose.
And I think that making it a\nplace of an educational space
could be a very,\nvery good solution.
I want this to be\nsomewhat flexible,
but I think there\nis reason to think
that people would use\ntables that can even
be designed by local people.
I want to activate that place\nand use it in such a way
that maybe digital\ninformation flows into that,
and that it's flexible enough\nso that different kinds
of lectures can take place,\nlike right in the middle.
We've done a whole\nbunch of drawings,
and I'm actually really excited\nthat maybe for the first time,
it'll really come to\nmuch, much better use.
Wonderful.
And the garden in the\nback, with the [inaudible],,
is that staying, or will that--
Yes, that's staying.
That's staying.
Thank you.
Time for drinks.
Time for drinks,\nOK, fair enough.
Thank you, Annabelle.
We look forward to the fall.
Thank you again.
