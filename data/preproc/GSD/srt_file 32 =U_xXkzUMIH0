So good evening, and welcome.
It's a real pleasure\nto be here with you.
It's great to see\nso many of you here.
My name is Mohsen Mostafavi.
I'm the dean of the\nGraduate School of Design.
And I'm delighted that\nthe honorable Martin Jay
Walsh, the mayor of\nthe city of Boston
has kindly agreed to deliver\nthe 2017 Dunlop lecture here
at the GSD.
Each year, the\nDunlop lecture brings
to campus a distinguished\nspeaker in honor
of Professor John T Dunlop.
Professor Dunlop\nserved as the chair
of the Department of\nEconomics here at Harvard
and was also the dean of the\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences.
In addition to his\nacademic career,
Professor Dunlop also served\nas the United States Secretary
of Labor during the\nFord administration
and had a lifetime career\nin mediation, arbitration,
and dispute resolution.
A distinguishing\naspect of his career
was his commitment to\nthe nation's construction
and housing industries.
And he played an important\nrole in the establishment
of the National Institute\nfor Building Sciences.
The Dunlop lecture is hosted\nby the Joint Center of Housing
Studies here at\nHarvard whose mission
is to advance understanding\nof housing issues
and to inform policy\nthrough research, education,
and public outreach programs.
Mayor Walsh will be introduced\nby Chris Herbert, the managing
director of the Joint Center.
Chris has extensive\nexperience conducting
research related to housing\npolicy and urban development
both in the US and abroad.
A key focus of his\nresearch has been
on the financial and\ndemographic dimension
of home ownership\nand the implications
for home ownership policy of\nthe recession, housing bust,
and foreclosure crisis.
He's actually a very friendly\nand cheerful person despite all
of these areas that he studies.
In addition to his role\nat the Joint Center,
Chris also lectures\nat the GSD where
he holds an appointment in the\nDepartment of Urban Planning
and Design.
He's the co-editor of\nhome ownership built
to last balancing access,\naffordability, and risk
after the housing crisis.
Chris and his colleagues have\nplayed a significant role
during the past few years in\nestablishing much greater links
between the Joint Center,\nthe GSD, the Kennedy
School through teaching,\nscholarship and, of course,
bringing important thought\nleaders like our speaker
tonight to campus.
Please welcome Chris Herbert,\nwho will introduce Mayor Walsh.
Thank you, Mohsen, and thank\nyou for your leadership
of this school and for all your\nsupport for the Joint Center.
Very much appreciated.
And before I forgot--
I forget, I also want to thank\nDavid Luberoff, Kerry Donahue,
and James Chaknis\nof the Joint Center
who did so much to organize and\nbring tonight's event to pass.
On behalf of the\nJoint Center, it's
my privilege to welcome you our\ndistinguished faculty, guests,
students, and the\nbroader Cambridge
community to the 17th\nJohn T. Dunlop lecture.
Each year the Dunlop\nlecture provides us
with an opportunity\nto recall and pay
tribute to Professor Dunlop\nfor his many important
contributions to the world of\nacademia, policy, and industry.
I know Mohsen said some-- gave\nus a bit of Professor Dunlop's
history, but I'd like\nto share with you a few
of our own reflections on him.
John was a remarkable man marked\nby a tremendous intellect,
shrewd vision,\nunflagging energy,
and for those of\nyou who knew him
and impatience to\nget things done.
He applied these skills in a\nlong and distinguished career
as a scholar, a dean, a\nmediator, a labor secretary,
and an adviser to presidents\nover the span of many decades.
But among his many\naccomplishments,
Professor Dunlop was\nalso instrumental
in providing support and\nguidance for the Joint Center
from its founding in 1959\nuntil the end of his life.
He recognized the importance of\nhaving a center at Harvard that
keeps a constant\nfocus on housing given
the fundamental role that\ndecent, affordable homes play
as the foundation for the\nwell-being of families
and individuals as a critical\nelement of healthy and vital
communities and as an\nengine of economic growth.
It's not hyperbole to say that\nwithout professor Dunlop's
unwaivering vision and\npersistent efforts,
the Joint Center probably\nwould not be here today.
So this lecture is a\nsmall, but important way
of marking our gratitude\nfor all that he
did to help the center pursue\nour mission, as Mohsen noted,
of advancing understanding\nof housing issues,
of informing policy, and of\ntraining the next generation
of housing leaders.
Over its history,\nthe Dunlop lecture
has featured a variety\nof perspectives
on critical housing\nissues offering
a platform for\ndistinguished leaders
from the worlds\nof home-building,
finance, advocacy, and policy.
Looking over the\nlist of past lectures
provides a snapshot\nof the housing
issues that have\nbeen most salient
since the start of the century\nwhen this lecture series began.
Today, the country is\ncertainly facing no shortage
of housing challenges with\nnear record numbers of renters
struggling to find\nhomes they can afford,
the opportunities to own a home\nat their lowest level in half
a century, communities\ndevastated by the fallout
from the great recession\nand the foreclosure crisis,
and surging demand\nfor urban living
that threatens displaced\nestablish low income
and minority communities.
And in the face of these\nissues, the response
from the federal government\nin these recent years
has largely been\nnotable for its silence.
But with these problems\nliterally at their doorsteps,
mayors across the\ncountry have had
no choice but to take the\nlead in seeking solutions
with every resource\nthey can muster.
And it was in this\ncontext, the obvious choice
for us to select for this\nyear's Dunlop lecture was
one of the mayors that\nthe-- nation's mayors
who have taken the lead\nin putting the housing
at the top of their agendas.
And in looking for\none of the leading
voices across the\ncountry, we had
to look no further than\nacross the Charles River
to Mayor Martin J Walsh\nin the city of Boston.
Since being elected\nin 2014, Mayor Walsh
has made housing and\ncommunity development
central to his effort\nto ensure that Boston
is a thriving, healthy, and\ninnovative city with equality
and opportunity for all.
Reflecting the importance\nof housing for the mayor,
in his first year in\noffice, he released
the plan Housing A\nChanging City: Boston 2030,
to help spur and guide efforts\nto meet the city's stark need
to expand the supply\nof affordable housing.
In addition to his\nleadership in housing policy,
Mayor Walsh was also\nan obvious choice
to deliver the lecture given\nhis experience in heading
the building and construction\ntrades council, which provides
another direct tie\nto Professor Dunlop's
legacy of strong support\nfor labor unions,
particularly, in\nthe housing sector.
Professor Dunlop was a founder\nof the Harvard trade union
program, which continues to this\nday in the labor and work life
program at Harvard Law School.
I have no doubt that\nProfessor Dunlop
would be tremendously gratified\nto have Mayor Walsh here
to help remember his\nlegacy as he would
at seeing the assembled\nfaculty, students, and community
who are here today who\nshare his deep concern
for the challenging housing\nissues we face as a country.
So is with great\nhonor and pleasure
that I introduce to\nyou Martin J Walsh,
the 54th mayor of\nthe city of Boston,
to deliver this\nyear's Dunlop lecture.
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Chris, and I\nwant to thank everyone here
at the Joint Center\nfor Housing Studies.
I also want to thank associate\ndean Luberoff and good friend
of my policy team at city hall,\nI want to thank you as well.
Dean Mostafavi, thank\nyou very much as well,
and everyone at the\nGraduate School of Design.
I brought a couple\nof people with me
today in case I get\nhot questions later on,
which I'm anticipating out of\nthis crew here as I look out.
We have Sheila Dillon, chief of\nhousing in the city of Boston,
and Joyce Lenehan, chief of\npolicy in the city of Boston
who helped guide us\nwith our plan, which
I'm going to talk a little\nbit about this evening.
I want to say good evening\nto all the students
that are here, the\nfaculty, and guests,
and I'm honored to join--
I looked up at the\nsheet a minute ago,
and I saw the distinguished\nlist of speakers
who spoke here before me.
And I said, oh boy, what am I\ndoing here, a kid from Dorch.
So I'm going to do\nmy best to keep you
involved and interested here.
But it's also\nvery, very exciting
for me, especially in the memory\nof a man like John Dunlop.
You heard a lot about him\ncrossing over different lines
from the university\ngovernment to labor secretary,
and sometimes that is easy\nand a natural transformation.
Other times it's very difficult.
But certainly in his work in\nthe Harvard Trade Union Program,
he spent his career\nbringing people together,
academic, government officials,\nworkers, labor leaders,
to better understand\nshared challenges.
And those of you that\nare new starting out
in this business, that's\nnot always an easy thing.
Because you have\npeople from coming
from very different\npoints of view,
and when you get them\nat a table understanding
that they really have a\nlot of things in common,
it's a matter of how do you\nget to that common theme.
So I want-- I'm\nhonored to be here.
If something we\ncould use more today
of in this world is an\nunderstanding and getting
to yes.
I think too many times\nwe don't have that.
I found these types of\ndialogue and collaboration
to be invaluable\nthroughout my career,
whether it was in labor\nor as a state legislator
or, certainly, in\nthe mayor's office.
That's especially\ntrue as it pertains
to the topic of this\nevening which is housing.
I want to start talking\nbriefly about my relationship
between the housing\nand inequality,
and it's a very\nstrong relationship.
Home ownership is a major\nmaker of wealth gaps,
as rents disproportionately\nburdens lower income households
even putting them in\ndanger of displacement
or even homelessness.
And we've seen that in\nmy three years as mayor,
we've even seen it in just\nmy three years as mayor.
As you look around\nthe city of Boston
or look in the\ncity of Cambridge,
you look and see\na lot of cranes,
you see a lot of growth, a\nlot of wealth being made.
But in those neighborhoods,\nyou're seeing a lot of poverty,
a lot of sadness, a lot\nof people being displaced.
Our numbers of\nhomelessness, which
I'm going to talk\nabout in a minute,
even though we've been\nsuccessful with getting
a lot of people\ninto a home, we're
seeing those numbers\ngrow every single day.
The relationship between\ncitywide, inequality,
and housing is a\nbit more complex.
But some of the income measures,\nBoston is among the most equal
of cities.
We are working to change\nthat, and that's something
that bothers me every day.
But we want to do it a\nway that lifts people up,
not just by the numbers.
Inequality metrics\nmiss sometimes
things about our city in Boston.
For example, consider\nthe following numbers.
19% of our housing units\nin the city of Boston
are subsidized or low income.
That's higher than\nany major city
nationwide as far\nas we can tell.
A study by the Urban\nInstitute in 2015
looked at housing in the\n100 most populated cities
in America.
It found that Suffolk\nCounty, which is primarily
the city of Boston\nhas the highest
ratio of affordable units\ncompared to extremely
low income renters.
We are also home to around\n150,000 college and graduate
students and nearly\n40,000 of those students
living off campus.
Many probably a vast\nmajority of low incomes.
Many of you in this\nroom can confirm that.
If these lower income\npopulations couldn't live here,
we might look like\na more equal city.
But we don't want to displace\npeople from somewhere else.
We want to make sure\npeople can and will achieve
financial security right here.
And in any case,\nwithout public housing,
universities would\nlose something,
would lose our\nidentity as a city.
Would lose a big piece\nof that identity,
and we wouldn't be the\nBoston that many of us love.
The biggest drivers\nof inequality
are global forces and\nnational policies.
Our role in that\nnational conversation
is to educate people on\nthe impacts of inequality
and advocate for solutions.
Health care, paid family leave,\nand day care, strong labor
laws, fair tax laws, financial\nregulations, infrastructure,
those are the issues\nthat I highlight
when I get together with other\nmayors on a national platform.
But locally our scope for\naction is better defined
by mobility, the opportunity\nfor people to get ahead in life
and achieve their\nfinancial security.
Mobility requires safe,\naffordable housing.
It also requires high\nquality prekindergarten,
grade 12 to K education, job\ntraining, transportation,
open space, public safety, and\nsmall business opportunities.
It's the framework\nthat binds us together,
all different issues tied\nup in housing and community
development.
We are so we are also\nincreasingly striving
to integrate our policy work\nso our planning work reflects
that in everything\nthat we do in the city.
The efforts move forward through\na wide set of partnerships
with other levels\nof government--
with foundations, with\nnonprofits, with advocates,
with businesses,\nand with developers.
I want to share some experiences\nwith those partnerships,
because they have shaped\nmy-- helped shaped my career,
and because I think they\nare the key to moving
urban policy forward.
Despite the challenges\ncities are presented
with at this time and moment.
In 25 years or so, I've\nlearned a lot about housing.
I've learned how to get it\nbuilt, the roles that people
play in working with\nit, the role it plays
with community development.
I started out as a construction\nlaborer out of college.
Well, I, kind of,\ndropped out of college
be a construction laborer\nand went back later.
I also served as the\npresident of my local union.
Later, I became the head of\nthe Boston Building Trades
in the greater Boston area.
In that role, I negotiated\nproject labor agreements
for large and\nmixed use projects.
Brought different types of\ndevelopments for contractors
to be able to deliver\nthose services.
I learned what it takes to get\nsignificant amounts of housing
built. It was also not just\nassembling terms for workers
in establishing\ntheir compensation,
it was about making sure\nthat the projects were
done to high quality\nsafety standards
and were financially viable.
Ultimately it required forging\nproductive partnerships
among players whose interests\nare not perfectly aligned.
Those players go beyond\nmanagement and labor.
They include abutters,\nneighborhood groups,
state and local officials,\nsometimes federal officials,
environmental agencies,\naffordable housing advocates,
tenant rights groups, and\neveryone, kind of, in between.
It can seem quite\nimpossible at first
trying to get all the different\nalignments on the same page.
But you find common ground,\nand you build on that.
You figure out how to make a\nproject work for everybody.
Representing workers, I\nwas also closely engaged
with the relation\nbetween jobs and housing.
Jobs give people the ability\nmanage their rents comfortably
and invest in homes.
They can also contribute\ntheir time and talent
to family to community\nand the whole spectrum
of city life and civic life.
For example, we\ndeveloped a program
called Building Pathways\nto help low income
people of color and women\nto get into building trades.
One of my key partners\nin creating this program
was the Boston\nHousing Authority.
I did it two years\nbefore I became the mayor
of the city of Boston.
We drew the participants from\nthe public housing residents.
Graduates now have options\nbeyond public housing.
Many of them have\nbecome homeowners.
Many of them are saving\nto become homeowners.
They're building\nhousing at work,
and they're living in\nconnection between their income
and housing access.
In 1997, I was elected\nstate representative
for the community where\nI grew up in Dorchester.
As a legislator in\nan urban district,
I got a deeper understanding of\nhow communities value housing.
For most homeowners,\nit's the foundation
of their financial security.
But housing is more than\nan economic transaction.
It's safety.
It's family.
It's a home.
That's what communities are for.
The patterns of housing\nin neighborhoods
make up the sense of a place.
Changes that seem to\nthreaten that identity
can create tremendous\ninsecurity.
We shouldn't write off--
we shouldn't write off\nas right now as not
in my backyard syndrome.
I consider myself privileged\nto have represented
the community in\nDorchester that saw
affordable housing,\nsupportive housing, sober
housing, diversity at\nthe core of the identity.
That's a true neighborhood.
But the residents still\nhave legitimate concerns
about change, whether\nthey're being treated fairly.
I found that a way a developer\napproaches a community process
can make or break a proposal.
That true whether developers\nare private, nonprofit,
or government agency.
There has to be an openness\nand a dialogue to start.
And elected officials\nhave to urge developers
to embrace that\ndialogue, if they
are to retain the trust\nof their constituents.
In 2013, I was elected\nmayor of the city of Boston.
One of the first things\nI was confronted with
was more and more people were\ncalling it a housing crisis.
Rents and home prices were\nraising beyond middle class,
working class, and low\nincome people's budgets.
And when I was a\nstate representative
we had the foreclosure\ncrisis in the Commonwealth,
so we passed legislation to\nkeep people in their home.
So we're not in the midst of the\nforeclosure crisis right now,
we're in the midst of a\nrising rent crisis right now
and a lack of prod-- a lack\nof product on the line.
I sat down with Sheila Dillon.
Sheila had previously worked\non a plan for housing.
And we talked about\ndoing a deeper dive.
We need to do a bigger\nplan, more inclusive plan.
We have to look at\nmiddle class housing.
We have to look at\nlow income housing.
We have to look at\ncollege housing.
Students renting in apartments\nwho many of you are doing it
now are probably paying\n$1,000 for a room,
and you have five roommates.
We're thinking how\ndo we make it better?
So in our housing\nplan, we calculated
that we have to build 53,000\nunits by the year 2030
to keep up with the pace that\nwe were experiencing in 2014.
It's a good thing we\nare ahead of pace,
because the\npopulation is growing
faster than we even thought.
But the challenge is\nmore complex than simply
matching housing units\nwith the population
or meeting the market\ndriven demands.
The challenge is to embrace\nour success as a city
while retaining the core\nvalues that got us here.
Those values center on\ninclusiveness, on opportunity,
on social and\neconomic diversity.
We-- if you want some\nwater, there's water here.
Please, help.
We are a community that welcomes\nall and leaves no one behind.
These aren't just ideals,\nthey are pragmatic needs.
I tell business leaders all the\ntime, and they agree with me.
We need housing\nfor working people,
so working people can\nafford, or we won't have
enough workers for our economy.
And we need to\nsecure a middle class
to support civic life\nand small businesses
in our neighborhoods.
So Boston's challenge is to\nprotect the growing low income
housing and our senior\nhousing and to prevent and end
homelessness and to\ncreate affordable--
affordability for\nthe working class
and for the middle\nclass, all while ensuring
growth, which makes\nour communities more
livable and likable.
These are goals\nthat are not just
straightforward as\napproaching development plans,
they take a variety of resources\nand collaboration to unlock.
That's why our housing\nplan is more than numbers.
To begin with, it broke out\nthat numbers into targets
for each income area.
Just as important, it laid\nout a set of strategies
how we reach these goals\nin these different areas.
And more than that,\nit created a platform
to bring different\nplayers together
who could forge new partnerships\nand strategies to meet
those various needs.
In other words,\nit called the city
to that dialogue, incorporation\nI talked about earlier with all
the different people.
Here's what it looks\nlike in practice.
We changed our inclusionary\ndevelopment policy
to require more\naffordable housing
from developers of medium\nand large scale developments.
It took a lot of\nconversations to make
sure we didn't\ndiscourage development,
and we kept an incentive to\nbuild affordable units on site
to push back against\neconomic segregation.
We joined a coalition\nto work together
and advocates to persuade Boston\nvoters to adopt the Community
Preservation Act.
It's a property tax surcharge\nto support housing access
to open space and\nhistoric preservation.
We tried it in\n2001, and it fails.
We came back in 2016, and\nit passed with nearly 75%
of the vote from Boston voters.
A strong endorsement\nthat's needed
for more affordable\nhousing in the city,
and the ability to create it.
And it showed that our\nresidents in the city
understand the need for us to\nbuild more affordable housing.
We also got funding from\nthe Bloomberg foundation
to create what's called\nthe Housing Innovation Lab.
This team has developed\npilot programs
for accessory dwellings also\nknown as in-law apartments.
It is toward model compact\nunits around the city
to get input about\nhow they might
fit into a fabric of\ndifferent neighborhoods.
We advanced community\nplanning projects
along the transit corridors\nto increase density
in areas that needed\ndevelopment where
we had good public transit.
We're formed the Boston\nHousing Authority--
excuse f me, the Boston\nRe-development Authority
and renamed it the Boston\nPlanning and Development
Agency.
And it wasn't just\nsimply a name.
It was that we were\ndoing development,
but we really weren't\nplanning out a community.
And now what we're doing\nis planning our community
as we do development.
And we've taken steps\nto address displacement,
one of the biggest\nchallenges in our city.
We created the Office\nof Housing Stability
to support tenants and work with\nlandlords to prevent evictions.
We also put forth five pieces\nof anti-displacement legislation
at the state house tied to\nthe Community Stabilization
Act, which I filed\nin the city council.
It will help protect tenants\nfrom evictions and homeowners
facing foreclosure.
The Harvard research\nor Matthew Desmond
has been influential in\ntaking on this issue.
He said, eviction\nto a black woman
is what incarceration\nis to a black men
in the terms of limiting\nopportunity and inflicting
trauma on the whole family.
It's another window into\nthe role of housing.
Not just in community\ndevelopment,
but in human development.
The results so far have been\npretty heartening for us.
We've gotten nearly 20,000\nunits of that 53,000 units
either built or in\nunder construction.
It's taken the pressure\noff existing housing
stock where working families\nlive bringing the average rents
down by 4% last year.
We also set a record\nof production,
producing thousands of\nunits of low income housing.
We invested $100 million\nover the last three years
in affordable housing projects.
That's city money.
Our new inclusionary requirement\ncalls for another $45 million
from recent project\napprovals alone.
And we expect another $20\nmillion from the CPA this year.
It all won't go into\nhousing, but it'll
be spread into\nthose three buckets.
We've also taken on\nhomelessness like never before.
We've built a new\n400 bed shelter
in the heart of our city.
That's after we had to close\ndown what was called the Long
Island Bridge.
Those of you that\naren't from here,
we have a bridge out\nto Long Island, which
is in the Boston Harbor,\nwhere in the morning
we would take our homeless\nfolks from the bridge on a bus
and drop them off in\ntown, and at night
we picked them up on a bus\nand bring them back out
to Long Island.
And what that made\nus do after we
had to close the bridge because\nthe bridge was literally
collapsing into the\nocean, it really
forced us to take\na good hard look
at how we are treating\nour homeless population,
and what are we doing?
And for all intensive\npurposes, we
were housing our\nhomeless population,
and we didn't really\nhave a plan to get
a pathway into home\nowner-- not home
ownership into an apartment, and\neventually into home ownership.
So we made this one of the\ncornerstones of our new housing
first system to get people\ninto housing with supports
they need to stay housed.
We have housed roughly 1000,\n1100 chronically homeless
individuals since July 4--
July 2014.
[APPLAUSE]
In 2015, Michelle Obama\nchallenge cities around America
to end chronic\nveterans homelessness.
We sat down in a room,\nWE talked about it,
and we said this is a\npretty daunting task.
The first thing, we didn't\nhave the exact number
of homeless vets we\nhad on the street,
but we took the\nchallenge up anyway.
And by the end of that\nyear, we started the year
with 450 roughly chronically\nhomeless veterans.
By the end of that\nyear, we had housed 551
chronically homeless veterans.
So we were able to end\nchronic veterans homelessness
in the city of\nBoston, and we're also
able to put veterans on\na path within six months
into a home themself working\nwith all of our partners.
That's something\nthat's important.
Our role-- our goal to\nend chronic homelessness
in the city of Boston is\nby the end of next year.
However, as I said earlier in\nthe beginning of this speech
that we constantly see\nmore and more people
coming into our system\nhere in the city of Boston
every single day.
So we're going to be\nworking with our state
partners and our\nother cities and towns
around the Commonwealth\nto make sure
that they're doing their part\nas well, because it can't just
be one city doing this work.
It has to be all 351 cities\nand towns in the Commonwealth.
We also know we have a long\nway to go to make housing
truly accessible to all.
But the dialogue and\nthe collaboration
and the creativity that\nhave unlocked proven keys
to making real progress.
And that will be even more\ntrue as we move forward.
The phase of my career\nI can close with
is one that just\nstarted, being mayor
during a new reality with\nthe federal government.
The white-- I heard\na couple of chuckles.
We can laugh.
Any press here, you\ncan write that down.
The White House has\nannounced its intention
to pull federal support\nfrom public housing,
from rental vouchers, from\nhome ownership programs,
from fuel assistance, from\ncommunity block grants.
Looking at these proposed\ncuts reveals all over again
how much housing is\ninterwoven with so much else.
One thing I want to say, and\nwe had a press conference
last week to talk\nabout the budget,
was in the budget there's\ntwo areas that I gave credit
to the administration on.
One was increased\nfunding veterans,
and one was increased funding\nto fight the opiate addiction.
But if you don't have the\nability for rental vouchers,
public housing, home ownership\nprograms, fuel assistance,
block grants, you're not doing\na service to our veterans, men
and women in this country.
Something that I want you to\nkeep in the back of your head.
Prior administrations\nhave helped
leverage the support\nthrough wider partnerships
that I've discussed.
But we've seen the\nreductions in these kinds
of proposals that are happening\nright now, proposed right now.
These cuts would bring many\nof these complex fundings
arrangements to a\nhalt. It's an effort
to end the system of\nfederal partnerships
that date back to the New\nDeal and the Great Society
Commitments of the\n1930s to the 60s
without replacing them\nwith any new concept
of national progress.
But despite all this,\nI am still confident.
With the work I\ndescribed above, we
put ourselves in a position to\nrespond at this very moment.
Even if the funding arrangements\nwe have seen threatened,
the relations we've built\nhave been very strong.
They will produce new\nsolutions for new ideas.
They will bring new\npartnerships to the table,
and I've noticed that\nforums like this, the United
States of conference--
The US Conference\nof Mayors where
we sit down and talk\nabout the challenges
that we have in the cities.
You would be-- you\nwould be surprised
how closely aligned\nthe red states
and the blue states are whose\nmayors come from those states
and those cities.
I hear it in meetings\nwith the CEOs.
I hear it in the meetings\nwith tech leaders,
hospital presidents,\nuniversity presidents.
They may not all vote the\nsame way on election day,
but they understand\nthat the threat being
posed by Boston's economy and\nto their employers well-being.
Boston is gearing up for a\nfight on a national level
to make sure we continue to\nfight for the people that
need us to fight for them.
This sense of urgency\nwill speed up our progress
in developing new partnerships\nwith new solutions,
taking regional\nplanning as an example.
Boston's economy is\nnot a Boston economy,
it's a regional economy.
Our housing market\nis a regional market.
But those affordable housing\nnumbers I cited earlier
are not shared\nacross our region.
We need to share these\nresponsibly and more evenly.
We need to give\npeople opportunities
to live in different\nneighborhoods as well.
That means working through\nthe state legislative process
and working directly\nwith cities and towns
across the Commonwealth.
We've already built\na strong foundation
in economic development\npartnerships,
and that's an easy one.
We all want to bring\nbusiness to our communities,
we all want to bring\njobs to our communities,
we all want to bring\ngrowth to our communities,
but we have to share\nin the housing market
as well with our communities.
We can no longer compete\nagainst our neighbors
in Cambridge and Somerville.
We need to work with them.
One final piece of this\ndialogue in collaboration
is the new era of\nmotivation in this room.
I hope it inspires\ntalented students
to go into public service\nand housing advocacy.
We're going to need\nyou in the years ahead.
I know some of you are already\nstudying in our neighborhoods
and even at city hall.
I want to thank you for your\ninterest and your commitment
in our city, and I\nwant to thank you
for your commitment and interest\nin this important issue.
Our city wide plan,\nImagine Boston 2030,
identifies major opportunities\nfor equitable, sustainable
growth from beacon\nyards in Austin
to Widett Circle to\nReadville and Hyde Park.
I probably won't be mayor by the\ntime Imagine Boston 2030 gets
off the grounds, but\nit's also important
that we're going to\ncontinue to move forward,
because you are the future.
Many of you young\npeople in this room
are the future of our city.
I look forward to\nseeing many of you
down the road at conferences\nand construction sites,
and I look forward to hearing\nfrom your questions right now.
And I just want to thank you.
The last thing I want to\nsay on a personal note.
I got into this\nbusiness of politics,
because I love giving\nback and helping people.
And there's an opportunity here\nthat I have every single day.
The housing plan that I\ntalked about, the work that I
talked about is not about me.
It's about a team of people\nthat sit that care about it.
And I want to just pass along to\nyou, a lot of you in this room.
Whatever your focus, whatever\nyour dreams are, follow
those dreams and\nfollow your focus.
If housing is your passion,\nwhatever side of it is on,
get involved.
Because that's where you\ncan make a tremendous impact
in people's life.
As I said earlier, I got into\nthis business to help people.
I didn't realize, I got into\nthis business 20 years ago.
I got elected April of 1997.
When I first ran for office, I\nwouldn't imagine 20 years later
working on a housing\nplan, figuring out
about displacement, building low\nincome housing, moderate income
housing to keep people\nin a home and give people
the opportunity to have\nfinancial stability
and security.
So you just don't know which\nway life's going to go.
So I want to thank you\nfor being here today,
and I look forward\nto your questions.
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
So the mayor has\ngraciously accepted
to take questions for\na while, and so we'll
have some microphones\nin the room.
So please when you raise your\nhand, look for a microphone.
Identify who you are, your\naffiliation, and remember
a question is not usually\nseveral paragraphs long,
and does end in a question mark.
So is there any\nquestions for the mayor?
Yes, right here.
This woman right here.
There we go.
Hello, my name is\n[INAUDIBLE] McCree.
I'm a student at\nHarvard Business School.
So my question to\nyou is for developers
that are developing\nin these communities,
do you ask them for concessions\nin their rent, or is it
more that you're\nrelying on market forces
to drive down rents.
I don't know-- I don't\nask for concessions.
We try-- it depends--
It really depends upon\nthe units of housing.
So for example,\nwhen we're trying
to build affordable housing\nin the city of Boston,
we'll try and use city only.
And if we can, we'll try and\nget good rates if we can.
We'll use some of the\ninclusionary development money
from other developments that\nmight be in town that they're
not going to do the on site.
Inclusionary development, if you\nbuild affordable site it's 13%.
If you go off-site, it's 18%.
So it gives us some\nadditional money.
It's really difficult to ask\npeople to lower their rates,
because you want people\nto make a living wage.
And you don't want to be\ngoing into them saying,
you've got to drop your rate.
Because there's a minimum\nwage in the city of Boston,
but we also have a living\nwage, which is a little higher,
I believe, than\nthe minimum wage.
And then we have construction\nrates, unions in Boston
as well, so we have a little\nbit of a mix of everybody.
But there's a big mix\nof housing in Boston.
There's all different\ntypes of development styles
of construction.
It really is how do you\nput the deal together.
I think what's going to be more\ncomplicated as we move forward
here in the future is that the\nstate will give some subsidies,
the federal government\ngives them subsidies.
I'm concerned that we're going\nto start to see those go away
where it's going to be\nreally reliant upon the city,
and how do we put\ntogether a subsidy that
can offset some of\nthe state credits
and the federal credits\nthat are out there.
That's where, I\nthink, we're going
to run into some problems.
Right now, some of the\nbuildings-- builders
in the room, I mean, the\ncost of construction is high,
the cost of material's high.
And I think that that's\none of the things
that I don't think we'll ever\nsee come down, because there's
so much demand right now.
There's so much construction\nin the pipeline.
Up the back.
Thank you for your talk.
My name is Andrea.
I'm a student here at the GSD.
My question is,\nhow do you balance
the need for more\nhousing in Boston
with the potential impacts of\nclimate change on the city?
That's a great question.
In our-- In our imag-- in\nour Imagine Boston 2030 Plan,
it really talks about--\nwe have outlines,
we have maps inside that\nplan that talk about what
some of the flood zones that\nwe have coming potentially
in the city of Boston over the\ncourse of next 50, 100 years.
We have some real smart housing\ngoing on in the city of Boston.
We have some projects\nin Roxborough
is out there, very green project\nwith using renewable materials.
Really we don't have\n100% plan, though, right?
We don't have one that\nwe force 100% renewable
and clean energy.
So we haven't gone that far\nyet in the city of Boston,
but we try to encourage\ndevelopers to use as much--
build as much to protect\nthe environment as possible.
I think that some of our--
the impacts of the climate are\nreally some of our large scale
development.
Most of our-- most of our\nlarge scale development
is along the waterway.
A lot of area that we have\nfor additional housing,
moderate, low income housing,\nis in the heart of the city.
So they're protected\nfrom rising sea tide,
but a lot of our high end\nhousing is right on the ocean.
So that's really\nsome of the-- some
of the challenges we're\ngoing to have in the future.
I mentioned Widett Circle.
Widett Circle is an\nincredible opportunity
for growth of the city\nof Boston right now.
It's a train yard.
The problem with Widett Circle\nthat it's in a flood zone.
So as developers look\nto build in the future,
they have to start\nplanning out how do they
build a project that's able\nto sustain a rising sea
tide of up seven feet over the\ncourse of the next 100 years.
So it's a complicated situation.
But we don't have rules\nright now on our one,
two, three family homes.
The force that it's a 100%\nenvironmentally friendly.
Right here.
Thank you for a talk.
I'm Dr. [INAUDIBLE] from\n[INAUDIBLE] Harvard Medical
School.
I wanted to hear your\nview on automation
and the implications\nof automation
in housing, economic\ngrowth, and accessibility,
mobility specifically?
And what's the role\nof mayor there?
What can you do, and what do\nyou see the changes will be?
Will you explain that\nautomation for me?
Automation and driving.
Automated driving, basically.
Oh, oh, like\nautonomous vehicles.
Autonomous vehicles, yes.
We're going to--
Transportation.
We're going to a plan right\nnow for autonomous vehicles.
I think, first of\nall, automation
is the future, obviously.
We know that.
I think that one of\nour biggest challenges
that we have in this city is\nautomation as far as vehicles,
and how do we move forward.
We're seeing in the\ncity of Boston--
and this is where the\nneighbor comes into play--
we're seeing in\nthe city of Boston
where somebody will\nput in a proposal
into the Boston Planning\nand Development Agency
to build 300 units of housing.
And they'll put it-- and\nthey'll be near a train
station or a bus route.
And you'll see the\nparking sometimes will
start at 0.5 spots per unit.
And the community will say\nwe want two spots per unit.
And there's that natural battle.
When in reality is they probably\nneed 0.5 parking spaces, not
two parking spaces, but how\ndo you get to that point?
So I think that over\ntime it will change.
I think we're still seeing--
this is-- I see a\nbig generational gap.
There's a lot of young\npeople in this room that
don't own the car, probably\ndon't have your license,
and you're probably in your 20s.
And when I was growing up, you\ngot your license the day after,
and every house had about\nseven cars in there.
So there's a\ngenerational change here
that's happening,\noccurring very slowly.
We are very involved\nwith autonomous vehicles.
We have a pilot program going\non now down the South Boston
waterfront.
We're partnering with the state.
But I also think\nthat we have to make
major investments in\nour infrastructure
as far as public transit.
I think that we are--most of our\npublic transit is feeding off
of diesel.
We have to prepare not just for\nthe current transit system now,
but we also the plan\nit for the future
is going to be the\nelectric system.
So I think that it's\nall still playing out.
I think we're in the\ntransition period
as we are right\nnow, and in 2017.
I think we're going to\nsee great gains, though,
in the next four or five years.
We're in the process right\nnow in the city of Boston,
we were able to negotiate\nan agreement with Verizon
to bring fiber optic cable\nthroughout the entire city
of Boston.
When I talked about that,\neveryone in this room
will get excited about it.
But if I talk about it\nat a senior building
or a civic association meeting,\npeople aren't as excited about.
Because they're\nnot understanding
that that's the growth of a\ncity that can happen with that.
What with that-- I know\nthis isn't your question,
but what happened with\nthat in Kansas City
when Google came in and wired\nthe entire city of Kansas City.
I was talking to\nthe mayor there,
Sly James, and once he did\nthat, all these companies were
moving to Kansas City,\ncoming into the city.
With that comes growth.
So we have to think about how\ndo we stay ahead of that growth.
Yes?
Hi, my name is Claribelle\nSantiago, and I live in Boston.
My question is in the\nImagine Boston 2030,
you have your promises,\nyour economic promises,
but your indexes\ndon't have the--
it doesn't have the outcomes\nof what you are proposing.
So the storytelling from the\ncommunity is not in there.
It's only your promise\nand the city plans.
No, none it's mine.
It's all the community.
I don't have an opinion on\nImagine Boston 2030 meeting.
It's not my plan.
It's the city's plan.
And I'll have to\ncheck-- afterwards we
can grab Joyce Linehan.
We can check into that for you.
OK.
But everything built\noff Imagine Boston 2030,
just like Go Boston 2030,\nwhich is our planning.
Let me just back up.
I'll come back to that.
But are you going to\nhave an index in there.
It should be in there.
I'm not sure if it is.
Or a dashboard or\nsomething to, what's been
done before and after stories.
Because Boston has a history\nwhich is very, very new
30 years of racial issues.
So I would like to see that\nin there, the inclusionary.
OK, let me just back up.
Sure.
2014, I got elected mayor\nof the city of Boston.
We started looking at different\nareas of the government.
We looked at\ntransportation, and we
launched a program called Go\nBoston 2030, which was a master
planning of\ntransportation and talking
about the future\nof transportation
was autonomous vehicles,\npublic transportation,
walking bicycling, all\nthe different modes
of transportation.
We had about 7,000\npeople that came out
of the farms across\nthe city of Boston
to have their input\nput into this plan.
We launched it-- launched\nit the other day, the plan.
The plan is not my plan and the\nplan is not the transportation
department plan and the plan\nis not the public works plan.
The plan is a plan that\ncame from the community.
We then created--\nthis is what we did,
kind of, all at the same time.
Then we looked at\narts and culture
and realized that we really\nhaven't had an arts and culture
play in the city probably ever.
So we launched a plan\ncalled Boston Creates where
people sat down small\nand large artists
from different\norganizations and people,
and they came up with\na plan on what they
wanted to see in the art\nspace, the arts community.
Imagine Boston 2030 started\nand within that plan
we have environment,\ntransportation.
We have every\naspect of civic life
and cultural life in\nthe city of Boston.
And that plan has been\ndrawn up by consultants
in the city going out\nlistening to the community
to see what they want to\nsee in the city of Boston.
And what they want\nto see their city
looked like in the\nyear 2030 and beyond.
This isn't about\nwhat I want to see,
what the vision I have\nfor Dudley Square.
This is about what the\npeople in Dudley square
have a vision for\ntheir community.
So all of the stuff that\nyou're talking about,
the racial stuff--
we'll-- that's a lot deeper.
I don't know what you\nmean by that in the plan.
But we're talking about the\ndevelopment of our city,
and what the city should\nlook like in the future.
All of that is on a website,\nImagine Boston 2030.
All of the index should\nbe on the website,
all the backup\nmaterial should be
on the website, and\neverything that we have
is very transparent on there.
So I'm not sure where--
if it's down the day\nyou looked at it,
but all that\ninformation is on there.
And we're in the\ndrafting phase now.
So we're still not\ncomplete with it.
We're in the next phase of\nstill taking comment on it.
Yes?
Hi, my name is Gabby.
I'm an undergraduate,\nwow, at Harvard College.
And you mentioned\nbriefly in your talk
about that not in my\nbackyard phenomenon,
where people support affordable\nhousing theoretically, but may
have concerns about having\nit in their neighborhood.
And I was wondering in\nterms of those concerns
with people wondering\nabout, like, the changes
in their neighborhood, what the\nmost prominent concerns you've
seen are, and how you\naddress those concerns when
you discussing this\nwith neighborhoods?
The biggest push back I\nget is density and traffic.
That's what everyone talks\nabout, density and traffic.
I'm not sure if that's\nactually the issue that's
going on at the time, but\nthey say density and traffic.
And we try to work\nwith those communities.
We're building more housing\nnow than probably almost
any other period in the\nhistory of the city.
So we have a lot of\ndevelopment going on.
So there's a lot\nof change going on,
and I think some\npeople get concerned
about their\nneighborhood changing.
I think people are concerned\nabout gentrification.
They are concerned about\ntheir Main Street areas
and not fully looking\nat the whole picture
that sometimes this\nactually improve
your Main Street by bringing\nmore people into the community.
So there's a lot of concerns.
There's a lot of concerns that\npeople have in different areas.
I know that--
I can go all around the\ncity and tell you some
of the concerns people have.
In areas like Codman\nSquare in Dorchester,
predominantly African-American,\nCape Verdean American.
People are tired of\nlow income housing.
They're like we don't want\nanymore low income housing,
we want moderate income housing.
We want to build\nup opportunities
around the Fermont\nLine for job creation
and support our retailers.
So we have different--\nthere's different concern
in every neighborhood.
Nobody's the-- no one\nneighborhood's consistent.
In Jamaica Plain, we just\nhad a big round about,
about-- we launch\nthese what's called
growth zones in the city.
And we look at two areas\nof the city, the first two
areas of the city in\nthe city of Boston.
One was in South Boston\nbetween the Andrew State
Corridor and the\nBroadway Station Corridor
on the left hand\nside of Dorch Avenue,
if you're familiar with it.
It's basically industrial\narea right now.
So we brought the community\nin and they sat down
and they talked about what\nthey wanted to see there.
And, obviously, a\nof it's housing.
But what they did, they create\na whole neighborhood there.
And what they were able\nto do, street scrape--
street scape new streets, parks.
Be able to build it out\nhow they want to see it
in the next 10, 15, 20 years.
In Jamaica Plain,\na little different.
We already had a lot\nof development there.
We had a lot of manufacturing,\nand what we're trying to do
there is come up with\nan idea of as this
gets redeveloped into housing,\nwhat do we want to see there?
And there was an organization,\none organization was trying
to get 70% affordable\nhousing there,
which isn't going\nto work, because it
was private investment.
And what we're trying to do\nis preserve affordable housing
in the neighborhood ironically.
So we get to a point where\nit was going to be, I think,
30% affordable housing in\nthat neighborhood where
any new development will\nhave a component of up to 30%
affordable housing there.
So we're preserving affordable\nhousing in that area.
If we didn't do that growth\nzone in Jamaica Plain, what
would have happened was that\neach development would come in,
the developed would come\ninto the neighborhood,
try and work the\nneighborhood down,
and say I will build 13%\noff-site somewhere or 18%
off-site somewhere, and I\nwant to build all high end
housing here.
Which is what's happened\nin a lot of areas.
So we've gone back and\nforth, and again in that case
we had a pro development\ngroup, kind of,
arise out of the community\nfrom the neighborhood.
So now we have competing\ninterests in the community.
And really what we're\ndoing with the growth zones
in some areas that\nare underdeveloped
area, industrial area,\nhow do we build those out?
How do we build more housing?
In areas that have housing\nstock there, how do we make sure
we preserve affordable housing\nin those neighborhoods?
So the growth zones\nare different as you
look around the city.
There's no consistent line.
Yes?
Once, yeah.
Gentlemen and then up front.
Hi, I'm Owen.
I'm a high school\nstudent Cambridge
I always wonder how you\nbalance the need and the desire
for affordable housing with\nthe need to attract development
into the future, and\nhow you, kind of, manage
that issue going forward.
I think it's just natural.
I mean, we need\naffordable housing
because future employers in the\ncity of Boston need workers.
And I think if there's\na workforce that's
in within the city\nlimits, it's able too--
they're able to supply jobs.
They're able to\nsupply the-- fill
the jobs that are out there.
And I think that's\nsomething that's important.
There's also a component of\nthis of working education wise.
We're working with\nRoxbury Community College,
MassBay Community College,\nBunker Hill Community College
to offer free college tuition\nfor high school seniors
that graduate Boston public\nschools at a 3.0, 2.0 GPA.
And then we're working with\nBU that once they graduate,
they go to BU to\nfinish their degree.
They have to hit\nrequirements, but with a 15--
less than $15,000 in debt.
So what we're doing is\nbuilding the housing,
but we're also trying to\nstrengthen the education
opportunities, and we're also\nworking with Creating Pathways
as college-- high\nschool graduates
into coll-- pathway into\ncollege, pathway into a career.
So it's all happ-- it's\nnot just one piece,
it all works together.
And I think in the future\none of the biggest concerns
that people have with the\npresident's ban on the refugees
is that it's limiting\nthe amount of people that
can come into this country\nto fill some of the tech jobs
that are out there.
So we clearly don't\nhave enough people
within our own country to\nfill all the jobs out there,
and by creating more\nopportunities for housing--
more stable\nopportunities for housing
that has to be wrapped around\nwith good transit system.
That has be wrapped around\na good educational system.
That has be wrapped around\ngood, safe communities.
So all of that.
It's not just one piece,\nit's all the pieces together.
There's a young\nwoman in the front.
I was really\ninterested-- hi, I'm
Kate O'Gorman, Kennedy\nSchool student here.
I was curious\nabout your comments
about needing, kind of,\nthe region to also take
a share in this burden.
And I was curious as to some\nof your strategies to, kind of,
bring your regional\ncounterparts along with you
as you're looking\ninto this new vision,
and some of the questions\nyou're asking yourself on that.
No, thank you.
One of the-- one\nof the things we
did when first got in as well,\nsat down mayors from Cambridge,
from Somerville, from\nChelsea, from Braintree,
from Quincy on the\nred line, and we
talked about creating what's\ncalled a Red Line Corridor.
And that's collaboration.
Trying to bring new tech\ncompanies into the Red Line
Corridor.
That means if Boston gets\na company or Braintree gets
a company or Quincy gets a\ncompany or Cambridge gets
a company, we shouldn't be in\ncompetition with each other.
We should be building\nup a collaboration
along the red line.
The red line connects us all.
So that's an easy\nmarriage to have.
Everyone's, obviously,\nfor economic development
bringing new companies and\nnew employment opportunities.
But when it comes to\nhousing, low income
housing, affordable housing,\nyou can't have one city do it.
It has to be more than one city.
We have to look around\nand look at other cities
around the greater\nBoston area to make sure
that they have their percentage\nof affordable housing
as well to give people\nthe opportunities
to live in those neighborhoods.
And I used to laugh\nat the state house.
I would-- we'd be fighting\nfor 40B, it's a state house,
and all of my dear friends--\nprogressive dear friends
we'd be fighting for all\nthe issues of recovery
issues and mental\nhealth issues, but when
it came to housing\nall of us said,
well, let's talked about that.
And we really have to\nspread that around.
And I'm not saying\nspread it around
to get people out of Boston.
I'm saying spread it around\nto give people the opportunity
to live in other\nareas, not just Boston.
If you have the\nmeans in this room
to be able to buy\na house in Boston,
you have the means to\nbuy a house in Braintree,
you have the means\nto potentially buy
a house in Newton and Wellesley\nand wherever you want to live.
People who are living\npoor and low income
and depend upon a housing\nvoucher or a section 8 voucher
to live somewhere, they don't\nhave that same opportunity.
They have to live\nwhere they're put.
Of they have to\nlive in an area--
they have a very small\narea to choose from.
So what I'm suggesting--\nand with the homeless--
with the homelessness as well.
It's let's truly be and\ninclusive greater Boston area.
So we give opportunities\nfor housing
for everyone in your\ndifferent neighborhoods,
and I think that that's\nan important piece.
It's not about saying we\nwon't put poor in Boston.
I'm proud of the fact that we\nhave people living in Boston--
low income families in Boston.
I want to keep them in Boston.
I don't want them to\nmove out of Boston.
What makes us special, and\nwhat allows me to stand up
at a microphone fighting\nback the immigration stop
and fighting back the\ncuts to the budget
is that we're a city\nmade up of immigrants.
We're a city made up of\nrich and poor people.
We're a city made up of\nblack and white people.
We're a city made up\neverybody, and we live
and we move forward as a city.
And people talk about how\ngreat Boston is as a city.
We are great city, and we're\na great city not because
of the leadership in the city.
We're a great city, because the\npeople that live in the city.
And we want to be able to\ntake what we have in Boston
and spread it around the\ngreater Boston area and possibly
the Commonwealth.
I think we need to\ndo more of that.
[APPLAUSE]
Hi, Mayor Walsh.
Gary Hildebrand, a\nlandscape architect
and on the design faculty here.
I'm going to\nviolate Chris's rule
and offer a comment\nrather than a question.
But I've been reflecting on\nMatt Kiefer's opinion piece
in yesterday's Globe, which\npraised your effort to plan
in the city.
By citing the fact\nthat Boston hasn't
had a planning effort of\nthis kind since the late 50s.
Yeah, a couple of years ago.
What we've had--\nwhat we've had--
what we've witnessed, I\nthink, many of us in the room
have seen this, but I\nthink it's maybe not
so known to the\nstudents in the room
that Boston has been going, kind\nof, block by block and project
by project to negotiate,\nbut without the big sense
that the vision\n2030 plan brings.
And I just want to\nsay that many of us
are grateful that\nyou've done this effort.
No, thank you for that.
And the 2030 plan, the\ndifference between the 2030
plan and the 1950 plan.
The 50 was a great plan, because\nwhat came out of the 50s plan
was the downtown skyline.
And there's a lot of great\neconomic development,
if you like to build\ntall buildings,
and I happen to do in\nthe city of Boston.
The 2030 plan is going\nto be a moving document.
It's going to be a living,\nbreathing document.
And there's going to be-- it's\ngoing to be housed, I believe,
at the end of the day at the\nBoston Planning and Development
Agency.
And the document's going\nto change over time.
And | think that with the woman\nasked about the environment
on housing, we've\nmade tremendous gain
in environmental\nprotections in this country.
And Boston's been ranked number\none in a energy efficient city
in America two years in a row.
And certainly what's\ncoming out of Washington
is bothering to some of us.
We're still going to\ncontinue to move forward.
We've to be carbon\nzero by the year 2050,
but depending on what happens\nin the rest of the country,
we're going to be able\nto make adjustments
in that plan dealing with the\nenvironmental actions of what's
happening with the environment.
Transportation, if the\nautonomous vehicles actually
do happen in the Commonwealth\nand in the country,
and we have autonomous vehicles\nhere in the next 20 years,
30 years, however\nlong it is, we're
going to be able to make\nadjustments and changes.
If we find a different way to\ndeliver public transportation,
I'm not a scientist and\nI'm not an engineer,
but I'm thinking what\na great way would
be to have solar panels\non top of tunnel caps
and using solar panels to power\nthe trains going to the city
and around America,\nbut here in Boston.
So all of that's\ngoing to be fluid.
It's going to change over time.
And the document is meant to\ngive an opinion of people,
but it's also meant\nto change over time.
And that's what we're\ngoing to do with that.
Before I take another question,\nI just want to make sure.
I'm thinking the fact that\nI said we have $100 million
in city money, it's city\nmoney and is it IDP money?
IDP money in\ninclusionary development?
Yep, and linkage.
And linkage, OK so it\nwasn't $100 million
from taxpayers' money.
It was $100 million from tax--
a combination of taxpayers'\nmoney, developers money,
and linkage money, which\nis developers money.
So thank you developers.
Mr Mayor, I know that you\nmay have another constraint.
Do you have time for\none more question?
I'll take a couple more.
OK.
There's one right here\nand one right here.
All right.
Any out back, did we\nmiss you up there.
I can't see you.
OK, we'll get three more.
One, two, three how's that?
Going down the back.
All right, thanks\nfor taking the time.
Avan O'Connor, a planning\nstudent here at the GSD.
You started to touch\non it a bit in response
to the question about\nnimbyism in the city,
but given the\nefforts you've taken
to create more of a\ndialogue around race
and traditional divisions that\nhave taken place in Boston,
how is that feeding into\nsome of your housing goals,
and what kind of behavior\nchange would you expect
on the ground from the city.
Great question.
I think that we haven't\nbeen able to dive in that
deeply yet as far\nas making impact
on the conversation on race.
We've had dialogues.
We've had conversations.
Right now in the\nmidst of training
facilitators to be able\nto come out and have
those dialogues in every\ncommunity in the neighborhood.
So I don't think we can\nnecessarily take credit yet
for those conversations fully.
I'm looking at Joyce just\nto get a nod of yes or no
across the board.
I think the nimbyism part\nof it is based on race.
Part of it's based on just that\npeople don't want development.
I think part of it's based\non fear, growth, change.
When I launched the\nhousing plan people
though it was a great idea.
And now I hear people\ncomplaining about me
in neighborhoods saying\nhe's building too much,
because they see so many cranes.
And they're confusing some of\nthe cranes in downtown Boston
as I'm building\nhousing there, I'm
building housing\nin the communities.
We're building in neighborhoods\nthat really haven't
seen development before.
There's housing units\ngoing up in Roxbury
and Mattapan and Dorchester.
And Southie, obviously,\nhas been pretty popular
for a long time in\nCharlestown and areas
like that have been popular.
But we're getting\nhousing projects now
in developments-- housing growth\nin neighborhoods that haven't
had growth in 20, 30 years.
So I think people are\npeople who are just
concerned about change.
And change is good\nfor a community.
It is good for a community.
I'm not saying displace\neveryone in the community.
I'm talking that type of change.
I'm talking adding more people\nliving into a neighborhood's
a good thing.
Mayor Walsh, thank you\nfor coming tonight.
My name is Andrew Kern.
I'm a master's student here\nin the Real Estate Development
Program.
My question for you is\ndoes your administration
plan to enact a\nsubsidization plan
or provide zoning exemptions\nfor privately developed student
housing?
If so, what\nrestrictions would you
put on developers of student\nhousing to ease your concerns?
That's a pretty\ninteresting question.
One of our parts of our plan is\nto encourage on campus housing.
That's the first answer to that.
We are not opposed to having\nprivate developers build
housing.
I don't think we can\noffer credits for it,
but I think what will do is\nwork with them to look and see
is there an opportunity if they\nbuild a mixed use development
and put housing on it,\nthey're going to make money
by building the housing from\nthe students living there.
Is that what you\nmean by the question?
Yes or encourage\nstudents to having
private developers having\nbuilt student houses for them
specifically?
Or
Oh, yeah I would love--
Because a lot of universities\nsuccessful university
struggle to build in\nvery dense increments.
Yeah, I know.
I've met with several\ndevelopers that want to build.
I don't think we have any in\nthe construction yet or discuss,
but we have had many\ndevelopers coming
in wanting to build student\nhousing for a college
or for a couple of colleges.
And we're not going to give\nthem special zoning rights.
They'd have to go to\ncommunity like anyone else,
but we would encourage\nthe community
to support that type of housing.
So you get places like\nSuffolk University,
Northeastern University who\ndon't have a lot of land
to build on anymore.
Maybe Boston\nUniversity still owns
a pretty decent amount of land.
So as the colleges-- in\nWentworth-- as the colleges
look to expand, and\nwe encourage them
to have 100% of their students\non campus by the year 2030.
We're asking them to do that.
Working with them to work\nwith private developers,
so that the smaller colleges\nthat don't have the ability
to build on campus.
So we're constantly\nvery open to that idea.
We have been very\nopen to that idea.
We've worked through some\nof the ideas of who's
going to police those units.
How is this structure\ngoing to use when it's a--
when it's a private\nbuilding housing
students from x college\nor two colleges,
how would they handle the\nstudents inside there?
Do they treat them like it's\na dorm life, because it's
undergraduate housing.
Graduate housing's\na little different,
and so we've worked through\nall of those challenges
about how it would work.
Now it's a matter of\ngetting a developer
to actually go forward.
I think we have two or\nthree proposals that
are being presented in\nfront of the city right now.
Yeah, I mean, I encourage that.
Absolutely.
Yes, sir.
Thank you so much\nfor your lecture.
My name's Adam Tanaka and\nI'm a planning student here.
And I had a question\nabout the middle class
component of your housing plan.
So how are you defining middle\nclass, how are you funding it,
and how do you justify that\nin the context of low income
housing need?
Thanks.
It's about 50,000 to--
50,000 to 120,000\nindividual family.
We're funding it.
It's all private\ndevelopment, but we're
talking with private developers\nto build it themselves.
We're not giving them\nsubsidized units.
These aren't subsidized units.
What we're trying to do\nis use city-owner land,
state-owned land.
The governor now\nand the governor's,
the states involved\nin this and trying
to get the land cost\nat the right price
so we can move them forward.
So we're trying to\nbe creative on how
we build this type of housing.
As I said, I was the head\nof the building trades
for a couple of years here.
In 2011 to 2013, we had\nvery little interest
in middle class\nhousing in the city
of Boston, large\nscale middle class
housing in the city of Boston.
People were building\nin the suburbs.
I became mayor in\n2014, and we were
getting a lot more interest now\nin developers actually coming
into Boston building\nmiddle class housing.
Today, I met with\na met with a-- met
with a company that\nowns $25 billion
of assets in the United\nStates of America.
They build anything from\nbig buildings in town
down to small buildings.
And they were talking about\ngetting into the middle class
housing market,\nand they're looking
to acquire some companies\nthat are in that market,
because they see an ability.
They don't see a\nreturn on investment
as large as some\nof the big stuff,
but they see a consistent\nreturn on investment,
if they get the capacity\nto be able to build enough.
So we're starting to see\ndevelopers play in this area.
Before we had a handful\nof developers like WIN,
but now we're seeing\nmore and more people--
and you see this--
we're seeing more and more\ndevelopers starting to say, oh,
there's something here.
And the housing can be built.\nI mean it can be built.
There's no question about it.
The cost of\nconstruction is high,
but again it's what the\ncost of the land is.
Mr. Mayor, do you have\ntime for one last question
from a faculty member.
Thank you very much.
My name is Mike Hooper,\na teacher at the GSD.
I was very interested\nin what you
were saying about thinking\nof the city as a region
and housing in terms\nof equitable housing
across the region, also the\nsustainability of the city
in a regional perspective.
And yet at the same time I was\nreading about the MBTA's plan
for sharp reduction in\nservice of commuter rail
service across the region.
So we're talking about exciting\nnew modes of transportation,
autonomous vehicles, etc.
And yet it seems like\na struggle to maintain
just regular service\nacross the region.
How does this proposed\ncut in in MBTA service
affect this idea of a\nequitably housed city region?
I think it's a problem.
I think that any time you\ncut a service back there's
a reason for it.
Obviously, not enough people\nare taking on the weekends.
But I think there's a\nproblem marketing as well.
I think people don't feel\nthat it's necessarily
reliable, dependable.
And I think for a\ncity like Boston,
we are a seven day a week city.
We certainly are a\nsix day a week city,
and to have that line cut off\ncoming into the city of Boston,
it's going to have an\neconomic impact on the city.
It's going to have economic\nimpacts on the system as well.
And I think that we have\nto look at transportation,
public transportation\nrather than limit it,
I think you expand it.
I think we have to look at doing\na long, we had the late night--
late night service here for a\nwhile in the city of Boston,
and there was a partnership\nwith the city and the state
and private industry,\nand people took it.
Now it might not have\nhad the ridership of 7--
5 o'clock on a\nWednesday afternoon,
but we have to\nprovide opportunities.
If we're going to-- if I'm\ngoing to get up here and talk
about public transportation\nand getting around the city
and not taking a car and using\nother modes of transportation,
one of those modes\nhas to be public.
It can't just be bikes\nand people walking,
so we have to work more with the\nstate to try and encourage them
to expand service,\nnot cut back service.
All right.
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you, Mr. Walsh--
Mr. Mayor.
So briefly just\na few things that
struck me about the\nmayor's comments.
One is when we\nthink about dealing
with housing issues,\nwhen we think
about it from the federal\nlevel, it's often siloed.
I think hearing from the mayor\ntonight at the local level,
he's talking about\nnot just housing talk,
he's talking about\ntransportation,
he's talking about\nurban planning,
he's talking about\nworkforce development.
Having all those things\nlinked is so important.
I think the way the mayor\ntalked about that holistically
is incredibly important.
Secondly, his comments as he\nbegan, he talked about the need
for dialogue.
And I think these\nissues are thorny,
and we're talking about\nbalancing the issues of housing
is balancing the\nissues of the community
and the issues of the broader\ncity and the broader region.
It's about balancing the\nissues of the tenants,
about the issues\nof the developers.
All these perspectives\nhave value.
They have to be balanced,\nand it's not easy.
And what it also\ntakes is good ideas.
And the other thing the mayor\nsaid that I want to echo again
is the fact that we need\ngood, bright people working
on these issues.
And I hope-- one reason we\nhad the mayor here tonight
was to inspire\npeople at the Harvard
at the Graduate schools,\nthe undergraduates schools,
at Rindge and Latin\nto go into housing,
to work on these issues.
And so I hope that--
Mr. Mayor, I\nappreciate you being
with us here tonight,\nsharing your perspective,
sharing your passion.
And I hope that you've helped\ninspire a new generation
of housing leaders.
So thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Thank you for being here.
[APPLAUSE]
