Good evening.
I take great pleasure to\nwelcome tonight's speaker,
Anna Puigjaner.
Anna's an architect, editor,\nresearcher, curator, mostly
traveler.
When she lights, she is\nalso co-founder of a studio
in Barcelona called MAIO.
Anna's spent a lot\nof time imagining
a future in which housing\nis more specifically suited
to the different needs\nof its inhabitants,
and especially the idea\nthat sometimes that
means not having a kitchen.
Her project that she\nentitled Kitchenless,
received the Wheelwright\nPrize in 2016,
with an endowment of\n$100,000 for research.
And that's the reason\nshe's never at home.
Researching internationally\nexisting models
of communal habitation.
Let me say a little bit\nabout the Wheelwright Prize.
It originated at Harvard, in\nthe Department of Architecture,
as the Arthur C Wheelwright\nTraveling Fellowship.
Now, the title is important.
This is 1935.
It was basically conceptualized\non the model of the Beaux-Arts
Grand Tour, of the\nEuropean Grand Tour,
where, no matter\nwhat your education,
no matter where\nyour education, you
couldn't be a properly\neducated architect until you
had gone to Rome, Greece, and\nseen all the ancient monuments.
And the prize, of\ncourse, was 1935,
was a time when Americans,\nvery few Americans,
traveled internationally.
And it was explicitly in order\nto make that travel possible.
I'll just mention a few\nof the early fellows.
Paul Rudolph, Elliot Noyses,\nWilliam Worcester, IM Pei.
There are many of that caliber.
In 2013, Mohsen Mostafavi\nopened the prize
to early career\narchitects worldwide.
Previously, it had been\nonly Harvard alums.
Now the rule is, the sole\neligibility requirement
is that applicants\nmust have received
a professionally accredited\narchitecture degree
in the previous 15 years.
I'm just saying, many\neligible people in the room.
As I said, though, when\nAnna won the prize,
it set her off on\na travel schedule
that I will let her tell\nand talk about tonight.
When she does, every now and\nthen, light like a flying bird,
her work has been\npublished, and MAIO's work
has been published in magazines\nlike DOMUS, Plot, Frame,
DETAIL.
The work was exhibited\nin the Venice Biennale,
in the Chicago\nArchitectural Biennial.
It's been exhibited at\nstorefront and other locations.
She's taught many, many places.
The firm, MAIO, is in\nBarcelona, in the Gracia--
it's called that, yeah?--
District.
Well, I don't know if\nyou have time to show it.
It's a very\ninteresting district.
It started in the time right\nwhen she won the prize.
They had taken on workers\nfrom other businesses
to make a collective\npartly, if I understand
for economic reasons, partly for\ntheoretical reasons, let's say.
By 2016, when they\ncould actually
afford to now have\na studio alone,
they actually decided that\nthey were no longer compelled
to have a studio alone.
So already this\nidea of cooperation
is a kind of kitchenless\noffice in its own way.
Welcome, Anna Puigjaner.
Thank you very much, Michael,\nfor such nice introduction.
And thank you everyone\nfor being here tonight.
As you may imagine, tonight is\nquite a special moment for me,
because I'm closing\ntwo years of traveling
that have been quite intense.
So two years ago, when\nI received the call
about the Wheelwright\nPrize, Mohsen Mostafavi
mentioned that I was\ngoing to be a life--
that it was going to be\na life changing thing.
And he couldn't\nhave been righter.
These last two years have been\nprobably the most intense ones
in my life, having\na strong impact
in both the professional\nand the personal level.
So I cannot be more\nthankful to the jury,
that at that moment two years\nago considered my proposal
of value, and that they have\noffered me this opportunity.
So thank you, Mohsen Mostafavi,\nMichael Hays, Eva Franch,
Jeannie Kim, Kiel Moe, Rafael\nMoneo, and Benjamin Prosky.
And of course, thanks to Harvard\nGSD and the Arthur Wheelwright
Traveling Fellowship itself.
Tonight, as you will see, we\nwill see a lot of kitchens
and a lot of food.
So my apologies, if\nyou haven't had dinner.
Because that's what\nmainly I've been
doing for the last two years.
But before going to\nthe cooking world,
let me introduce the origins\nand aim of this research.
When Rem Koolhaas published\nhis famous book, Delirious New
York, in 1978 40\nyears ago, he pictured
a city in New York defined by a\nset of big buildings on a grid.
The famous grid created in 1811,\nthanks to the Commissioners'
Plans that was actually showed\ninside the flap of the book.
In Koolhaas'\nimaginary, buildings
enclose as envelopes a\nwhole world in themselves.
And the [inaudible]\nis just the base
that allows those\nextraordinary worlds to happen.
In fact, several\nprojects developed
by Koolhaas and his colleagues\nat OMA appear in the book.
Among others, this one, the City\nof the Captive Globe project,
that shows, again, the\n[inaudible] uniform grid
that supports a set of\nbuildings representing
a beautiful catalog of OMA\nself-proclaimed influences.
As, for instance,\nwe can see here,
there is Le Corbu,\nLissitzky, over here.
So they saw New York\nas an incubator that
holds an extraordinary set of\nreference, extraordinary pieces
as a collection.
A type of world,\na type of reality,
where the building,\nspecifically the skyscraper,
defines the protagonist\nto the point
that it is treated\nas [inaudible] shown
as characters, as\npersons themselves,
as people themselves.
Sorry.
So like everyone,\nI got fascinated
by these extraordinary\ncollections of skyscrapers,
and especially captured my\nattention the Waldorf-Astoria,
especially because the\nWaldorf-Astoria holds
a set of apartments\nthat lack of kitchens.
So around 10 years ago, I\nstarted researching about them.
I was fascinated, as Koolhaas\nwas, with all the stories.
You see the\nkitchenless floor open.
With all the stories\nembedded in that building.
The people that\nlive in it, its type
of organization, its structure.
It was kind of a gossiping\nthing, also a bit vicious.
To my surprise, when I try\nto understand the origin
of this kitchenless typology.
I discovered that\nNew York was filled--
I discovered that New York\nwas filled at that time
by similar apartments, that\nthe Waldorf-Astoria was
extraordinary because it\nwas extremely luxurious,
but that actually that typology,\nthe life without kitchens,
and to have all those\nservices instead,
it was quite ordinary,\nquite common.
There was a time in New\nYork when the house was
understood as an open system.
It was designed not as\na single entity, but as
a set of connected\nfragments, that could
change depending on the need.
So it was systemic.
The space was flexible\nand adaptable [inaudible],,
and expanded also by\nmeans of collective rooms
and domestic services.
The kitchen was optional, as\nwell as the rest of the rooms,
and sometimes it was\nleft apart, kitchenless.
The story of this\nNew York kitchenless
typology dates back to\nthe economic depression
that followed the American\nCivil War in 1865.
At that moment, new\narchitectural solutions
for the middle\nclass appear, that
not only reduce significantly\nthe cost of living,
but also allow the elimination\nof housekeeping annoyances.
There were all\nkinds of apartments,
and all kinds of sizes\nas well, all of them
promoted by the private sector.
And we could find small\ncases as this one,
with two rooms and a bathroom,\nto extremely large ones,
with two apartments per\nfloor plan and no kitchen.
Due to the commercial aim,\nit was highly appreciated
that such buildings could\noffer not only a wider spectrum
of shared spaces\nand shared services,
but also flexible\nsized apartments.
Not only to offer good\nservices for the inhabitants,
but also to satisfy\na bigger demand
and accommodate a\nwider social range.
In New York,\nkitchenless houses--
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
So despite being promoted\nby the private sector, also
these collective houses\nhad quite a social role.
Most of the rooms were\nopen to the public,
becoming true social condensers.
So thanks to the\nexternalization of the kitchen
and other domestic\nspaces, the typology
blurred the traditional\nlimits between the public
and the private sphere, between\nthe domestic and the urban.
And thanks to its flexibility\nand [? sharing, ?] it
was able to shrink radically\nhousekeeping cost, waste,
and labor.
So if Koolhaas saw New\nYork as a city defined
by big skyscrapers, for\nme, New York was a city,
and is a city defined by\na fragmented, flexible,
and interconnected reality,\nwhere the kitchen played
an important role to allow\nthis flexibility to happen.
And this way of\nlooking at things
is also a condition\nof our time, a way
of seeing our\nclosed reality from
a contemporarily perspective.
This image was captured by our\nattention years ago by the fact
that the domestic scene\nand interior was placed
in a provocative manner in\nthe middle of the landscape,
raising questions regarding\nthe limits within inside
and outside, questions\nregarding what
domesticity meant at that time.
Nowadays, this exact\nimage struck us
not only by that but also by\nthe fact, by other things.
So a decade ago, a family would\nstill gather around the TV.
Nowadays, not only has the\nimage and identity of the family
has radically changed, but\nalso a new social reality
is engaging with the\natomization of devices
and increasing\ndemand on services.
The TV has lost definitely its\ncentral space in the house.
And therefore, it has\nmodified behaviors and the way
we use our homes and\nour cities at large.
Now we not only watch\nTV in the living room.
We watch TV in the bedroom,\nand even in the city itself,
in the subway.
Uses are superimposed,\noverlapping,
and the way in which we use the\nspace becomes increasingly more
fragmented, as it happened in\nthe 19th century in New York.
More fragile, and\nalso more ephemeral,
but at the same time,\nmore interconnected.
So when two years ago,\nI proposed this project
for the Wheelwright\nPrize, my intention,
my initial intention was\nactually what I said.
It was to turn visible\nthe contemporary cases
of collective kitchens,\nand through that
to expose that\nshared kitchens have
deeper political,\neconomical circumstances.
However, my interest\non collective kitchens
goes beyond that.
As it happened in\n19th century New York,
I consider that the\nkitchen can be once again
an architectural tool to\ntransgress and redefine
pre-established social\nand spatial conditions.
Specifically, domestic\nconditions, of course,
in relation to gender, labor,\nhousekeeping, and waste.
And that in order to answer\nto our contemporary network,
ephemeral and mobile reality.
In order to unveil this,\nduring these last two years,
I have done five travels,\nvisiting eight countries,
researching with a group\nof international, marvelous
people--
they might be watching now--
that I have traveled with, and\nthat have traveled with me,
allowing me to understand better\ntheir culture and be super,
super nice with me.
So I really have to thank\nLaura [? campagne, ?]
[? ada madiata, ?] [inaudible],,\n[inaudible],, Yuki Masamoto,
[? gizem ?] Morales, [? nori ?]\nArtigosa, and Mikako Oshima.
And of course, my partners at\nMAIO have allowed to do this.
So thanks to Guillermo\nLopez, Maria Charneco,
and Alfredo Lerida.
So alongside with these five\ntravels to Senegal, Bangkok,
Singapore, Montreal,\nMexico, Tokyo,
and China, and [inaudible]\nsorry, Lima, as so
alongside with these travels,\nthanks to the visibility
of the award, I\nhave been invited
to talk about the research in\n26 places in the last two years.
And I taught three workshops.
So if you add all that\nto the sum of my trip,
I was quite [? scared. ?]\nSo it's like 170,000 miles.
So it's like I did seven\ntimes the world tour.
And yes, I'm tired.
So I'm going to start\nwith my last trip.
40 years ago in Lima,\nstarted a system
of collective\ncooking that has been
able during these last decades\nto not only reduce housekeeping
costs, but also to\nprovide access to food,
as well as has been\nable to empower women
in Peruvian society.
Since its origin, these\ndomestic organizations
have been community\npolitical agencies
that go beyond the act\nof cooking and eating.
A radical system\nthat blurs not only
the limits between\nprivate and public,
between family structures and\ndomestic worlds, between labor
and housekeeping, but also act\nas a place for neighborhood
management, connected directly\nwith municipal institutions
and larger political agencies.
The first collective canteens\nwere born at the end of 1970s.
So exactly around 1978,\nfrom grassroots movements.
And it was a period in Lima\nof great social mobilization
and politicization, that\nultimately brought down
the military regime.
Between 1978 in 1979, the\nNational Teachers Union, SUTEP,
occupied local schools as\nthey pressed for better wages.
In solidarity with the strikers,\nwomen from the communities
began to prepare\ncollective pots,
as they called it, of\nfood to feed the strikers.
For weeks, schools became\nplaces of political discussion
about working conditions,\nhousing, and communities.
Many women who were leaving\nthese collective pots
participated in\npolitical meetings,
which encouraged to them to\nstart women's organizations
focused on providing food for\ntheir families and communities
in a wider sense.
The first one appeared in\nLas Comas in El Agustino
neighborhood, and used a\ngroup between 20 and 40 women
with the aim to provide,\nas I was saying,
food for the community\non a daily basis.
In front of the economic\nand social instability,
these collective kitchens\noffered security and stability.
So the typology\nexpanded really fast.
It not only happened in Lima,\nbut happened and is still
happening all over Peru.
[inaudible] it expanded in\nthe '80s, and their impact
has been quite large.
So suddenly they gained\nquite a political agency.
What the started around a\ndomestic space, a kitchen,
gained autonomy and\nentity, to the point
that their social relevance\nand, consequentially,
political power was\nradically punished
during the years of the\nterrorist group, the Shining
Path.
When many attacks happened\nagainst these women
and against these collective\nkitchens, many of them
were killed.
And among them, I\nwanted to put her image.
Among them, the activist\nMaria Elena Moyano,
who was murdered in 1992\nby the terrorist group,
and provoked a huge social\nconsternation due to that.
Of course, I'm selecting\nMaria Elena Moyano
because she was one of the\nleaders of the women groups,
specifically the La Federacion\nPopular de Las Mujeres de Villa
El Salvador, FEPOMUVES, that\nyou will see that it comes
afterwards in another story.
So sorry.
Excuse me.
What is curious\nis actually that,
despite the political\nimagination that
has been raised during\nthese last decades
about these collective\nKitchens being political,
if you ask nowadays\ntheir members
about their political\nagency, most of them,
they're going to deny that.
They are going to say\nthey are quite apolitical.
They consider themselves\njust a grassroots movement,
that wants not to be linked\nwith any political party.
However, these radical acts\nthat I was mentioning before
prove that actually they're\nquite totally the opposite,
quite political.
And just by the fact that they\nhave a strong social impact
and have a strong social\ninfluence on Peruvian society.
So after several governments\nand different state policies,
comedores populares are\nstill quite active in Lima,
providing food to around\n1 million people daily.
And considering that,\ndepending on the cases,
you can tell that between\nhalf million and 1 million.
But considering that\nthe population of Lima
is eight million a half,\none million is quite a lot.
And in comedores populares,\nthere more than 100,000 women
cooking daily for the community.
So as I was mentioning,\nthe phenomenon
has not only happened\nin Lima, but has also
happened in the whole of Peru.
The government registered 16,461\ncollective kitchens in 2017.
And actually, they confess that\nthat might be the half of it.
So just the half of the\nreality is under control
of the government.
For those that don't know\nLima, let me explain a bit.
So Lima is a hilly city.
The so-called cerros, like\nthese little [? mountains, ?]
characterize the\nurban landscape,
and are the areas where most\nof these kitchens are placed.
Los cerros were and still\nare massively occupied
after the 1950s, due to large\nmigrations of rural population
to the city.
In 1960, the population of\nLima was around two million.
Nowadays, as I was mentioning,\nit's around 8 million a half.
So the city expanded enormously\nduring these last decades.
And this population is\nsettled in an informal manner,
occupying the hills due to\na lack of an infrastructure
and urban planning.
In one of the oldest\nsettlements is
placed one of the first\ncollective canteen
kitchens that is still\nworking nowadays.
Situated in El\nAugustino, [spanish]
is a small infrastructure\nrun by 15 women, which
are self-organized\nand cook once a week,
serving around 100 meals\ndaily from Monday to Saturday.
The cost of the meal is around\n4 soles, 4 soles and a half.
So to picture that,\nit's around half
of the price of a\nregular daily menu.
They can offer menus\nfor such a low price
thanks to a good\nwholesale organization
and efficient\ncollective cooking,
reducing waste and\n[? consumes. ?] Around 50
of them, as I was mentioning,\nare under the control
of the government.
And they receive monthly\nnonperishable foods.
Most of the Kitchens\noperate in a similar manner.
And most of them, as\nthis one, occupy--
as this one-- sorry--\noccupy pre-existent houses.
So they occupy domestic\ninfrastructures,
converting any\nprivate domestic space
into a collective one for\nthe welfare of the community.
This actually was an\nold living room before.
Just a few of them have\nbeen able to receive
governmental help to\nraise up new buildings.
Cases as this one, the\n[spanish] also in El Agustino.
Or La Balanza placed in--
La Balanza, placed in Comas,\nare quite an exception.
As you see, La Balanza,\nit's really well-designed.
It was designed by Javier\n[? vera, ?] [? luciano ?]
[? valez, ?] and\n[inaudible] among others.
So there were\narchitects involved.
Apart from the kitchen, it\nincorporates other spaces
for the community\nas a study room.
As a study room, as\nwell as a playground,
and a room for [inaudible].
So La Balanza definitely has\nbecome a social condenser,
and its [? important ?] to\nincrease control and preserve
the human quality of\nits actual context.
So kitchens in La\nBalanza show us
the relevance of the act, of\nthe act of turning something
domestic into something\npublic, not only
for the welfare of the\ncommunity at large,
but as I mentioned before,\nessential for the empowerment
of women, which mostly\nlack enough access
to essential things, as\nlabor, education, nutrition,
and social security, among\nother things, other basic needs.
The lady in the\npicture is Marta Vera.
Actually, apart from\nrunning this small store,
she runs a small company with\n30 employees that produce bread,
boiled eggs, milks\nfor public schools.
They prepare around\n11,000 servings a week.
You have to imagine\nthat when I arrived,
I was looking for a company,\nlike a big enterprise.
And then I encountered these\nwomen behind those bars,
and I asked for her, and she\nwould answer, yes, here I am.
And I was definitely\nshocked by the fact
that behind that, she\nwas there, the owner.
And behind those bars,\nthere's a huge company
that produces all this food\nfor the public schools.
So the story of Marta\nVera is quite interesting.
She started cooking in\na collective kitchen,
as many other women.
She did not finish her studies.
And due to her\neconomic situation,
the kitchen offered her a\nsolution to access to food
and decreased cost, home cost.
Thanks to the\nkitchen, she started
to be involved in\ngrassroots movements
and political\nassociations, becoming
a leader of her\nassociation, and later
allowing her to start\nher own baking business.
Everything started in 1987,\nwhen US Agency for International
Development--
so the US was involved--\nstarted to ship wheat to Peru.
So the US wheat was\ndistributed through NGOs
to the different\ncollective kitchens.
It emerged then\nthe idea to start
a system of bakeries that could\nproduce bread for all of them.
At the beginning, in 1990,\nthere were 26 bakery businesses.
But after USAID,\n[? usaid, ?] as they
call it, stopped\nsending wheat, they
were forced to change their\neconomic business system.
And progressively, without\nthe aid, most of them
had to close and disappear.
It's quite interesting.
Sorry.
It's quite interesting,\nbecause nowadays, actually,
the government of Peru\nis debating a regulation
to encourage among these women\nto start their own businesses.
And cases as this one show\nus how a shared kitchen can
be also a place for\neconomical production
that goes beyond\nthe act of baking,
places that can turn and\nwaste housekeeping labors
into a wage [? won. ?]
Influenced by the Lima case,\nthe government of Mexico City
initiated in 2009\na social program
to relieve financial\npressures that
were put on the middle class due\nto the economic crisis of 2008,
as you may imagine.
While soup kitchens and similar\nhad been running for years,
serving free meals to people\nwith very limited resources,
much of the population\naffected by the economic crisis
either could not use them,\nbecause their economy situation
was not that bad, or either they\nwould not accept to use them.
So the city thus decided to\npromote community kitchens run
by a mixed management,\nhalf public, half private,
with shared responsibilities\nto encourage community
participation and promote\ncitizen appropriation,
all while making a\nsignificant impact
with really low resources.
The city-backed collective lunch\nprogram, so-called comedores
communitarios, is used\ndaily by thousands
of citizens in Mexico City.
The system is quite simple.
Any citizen with a\nroom larger than has
323 square feet\nin their house can
apply to use this space\nas a community kitchen.
If accepted in the\nprogram, the city
will install an\nindustrial kitchen,
supply all kinds of cookware\nfor industrial cooking,
and deliver various\nnonperishable foods,
as it happened in Peru, such\nas rice, beans, bi-weekly
or monthly.
The people responsible\nfor each kitchen in turn
are expected to cook\nfor the community
and offer a daily\nmenu in their homes.
In the eight years\nsince the program began,
hundreds of houses\nin Mexico have
been refurbished to\naccommodate daily meals,
opening their living\nrooms to the public,
and transforming private\nspaces into public ones.
And yet the\ntransformation of a home
into a comedor\ncommunitario typical
involves minor changes to the\nstructure of the house itself.
The communal dining room\nmight be simply located,
as here in a [? patio ?]\n[? cupboard unit. ?] Or as you
will see in the future, in the\nnext images, in even garages.
I love these kind of\nimages that show actually
how the most private\n[inaudible] mixes with the most
urban and collective reality.
So the residents of these\nhomes can meet with neighbors
during lunch hours.
The public and the\nprivate, the domestic
and the urban co-exist.
This one, for instance,\nis a comedor communitario
placed in a garage.
So they take out the\ncar for a few hours,
and they transform\nit, basically.
So usually Mexico,\na low cost menu,
called popularly "comida\ncorrida," costs about 80 pesos.
And is generally comprised\nby beans, rice, some wheat
tortillas, and a soup.
The menu in these comedores\ncommunitarios is similar.
Yet, thanks to the\ngovernment subsidy,
can be sold for only\n10 pesos, which is 1/8
of the regular price of a menu.
Which is actually also enough\nto pay a minimum wage to those
participating in the preparation\nof food maintaining and food
preparation maintaining\nof the space.
Sorry.
I could have the chance to get\nin touch with the government,
and they actually\nfacilitate me these maps,
that they used to control.
They actually have this\nsystem of weekly controls.
So the government,\nor one social worker,
usually steps weekly\ninto the kitchen,
just to be sure that\neverything is OK.
And when I received the map,\nI was really deeply impressed
by the fact that in such a few\nyears, less than 10 years--
is started in 2009--
the city of Mexico looks\nlike this nowadays.
So there are hundreds of them.
And the list of demand, the\nwaiting list is extremely long.
The government just\ncannot afford to pay more
nonperishable foods and\nsocial workers to control.
So this is a typical\nlunch menu in one
of the comedores communitarios.
So officially, food is served\nand must be consumed in situ.
However, OK, it's Mexico.
So despite the law,\nthese kitchens usually
serve food not only in\nhouse, but also beyond,
in order to increase\ntheir income
and satisfy a larger demand.
So there's a huge system, a\nlow tech system of deliveries
that allow that to happen.
Like a retired lawyer\npicking up food
for his family and his friends.
Also unemployed men that\nalso help their neighbors
to pick up the food because\nthey couldn't pick it up
during labor hours.
So many are family-run.
Others, however, employ\noutside personnel.
Those who work in the kitchen do\nso for many different reasons.
Some are there to\nsupport the community.
So it's more ideological.
While others need the paycheck.
The kitchens are mainly managed\nby women, who in many cases
are either housewives or\nwere previously unemployed.
However, like the Peruvian case,\nalso a lot of men work in them.
In Mexico, a wide\nsocial [? array ?]
participates, eats, and\ncooks in collective kitchens.
Not only the fact that male and\nfemale cook in an equal way,
but also the fact that their\nplace in diverse neighborhoods,
as you saw in the map.
And that helped to turn\nthese infrastructures
to be more accessible\nand welcoming to anyone.
We find cases as\nthe small ones as we
have seen placed in all\nhouses to this one, that
is Las Margaritas, that\noccupies an old sports center,
and has been able to grow.
They offer, like, 400 meals\na day, so it's quite large.
And apart from the\ncooking and services,
they offer all\nkinds of services.
Like doctor, classes.
And it's extremely\nwell organized
in order to allow that to\nhappen with such a low budget.
Classrooms for activities,\nsmall stores, psychology,
tanatalogia, dentists.
I mean, all kinds.
It's really, really impressive.
And they even cultivate,\nthanks to a New Zealand ONG,
they could manage to\nbuild up this green house.
And they even cultivate\ntheir own products.
So what has changed\nmore than anything
are the dynamics of the\nneighborhoods themselves.
The community dining\nroom becomes an extension
of the adjacent houses.
The collective kitchen\nreplaces and complements
private kitchens that otherwise\ncease to be regularly used.
Despite being a relatively quite\nnew program, the daily routine
of cooking for the community,\neating, picking up things,
the food, meeting\nin the dining room,
has taken root quickly\nthrough the city.
In fact, when you're actually\nentering one of those shared
dining rooms, one feels\nthat it's actually
entering in a domestic\nspace, despite knowing
that those people\ndon't live there.
The influence of the\ncommunity kitchens
extends well beyond the\nhouse in which it is located.
And when looking at the map\nthat I showed you before,
all these collective\nkitchen rooms,
it is evident that\nthe impact goes far
beyond a specific neighborhood.
And we're talking about,\nreally, an urban network
of collective participation.
Let me go back to Lima.
In 1990, a group\nof Canadian women
traveled to Lima to visit\ncomedores populares.
At the time, there were\nready collective kitchens
in the area of Quebec.
And the similarity of both\nsystems prompted the meeting.
So it's not that one\ninfluenced the other.
It's just that both came\nout at the same moment,
and they met, luckily.
The case of Quebec is\nalso quite interesting.
At the beginning of\n1980, three women
decided to cook\ncollectively in order
to reduce household costs\nat the end of the month.
The initiative came from\n[? jacine juliette, ?]
who is here in the picture.
Actually, I pictured\nher, and I could meet her
in her actual\nbusiness, Le Chic Resto
Pop that operates as a\nrestaurant for offering
affordable and healthy\ninexpensive food.
So at the end, she ended up\nworking in relation with that.
So [? jacine, ?] in the\n'80s, was a single mother.
She was struggling to handle\nnot only with family expenses,
but also to manage her job hours\nwith housekeeping and family
care timings.
So she proposed to her\nsister and a friend
to start sharing to make the\nsituation better, easier.
And suddenly, thanks\nto a social worker,
this domestic organization moved\nto a neighborhood association,
opening the first neighborhood\nkitchen in 1986, the one
that you see in the image\ncalled Hochelaga-Masionneuve.
And the practice\nsuddenly began to spread.
There are already more than 100\ncollective kitchens operated.
There were, at the end\nof the '80s, around 100.
And what was\ninteresting, actually,
is the consequences\nof the trip of Peru.
The trip of Peru allowed\nthem to become aware
of the political power,\nwhich they were not before.
And suddenly, the they\nstarted to organize.
They started to be organized\nunder a partnership called
Regoupement des Cuisines\nCollectives du Quebec, that
still nowadays\noperates as a manager
and helping them\nto be networked.
And what is\ninteresting is actually
that despite the\nsimilarity of the Peruvian
and the Canadian, between both\nthe Peruvian and the Canadian
origin, through\nthese last decades,
these kitchens have\nevolved, defining
large differences between them.
So the origin was quite\nsimilar, but nowadays, they
operate radically different.
In Quebec, the\ncollective kitchen
is just used every 15 days.
That day, the kitchen\nadmits and cooks
in large quantities for\ntaking home several portions.
So the act of cooking\nis done collectively.
Everyone participates actively.
The groups are small,\nabout eight people.
And they are run by\na social worker, who
organizes and controls\nthe station in order
to make it successful.
Being so small,\nthe participation
is always really intense.
I always cooked in\nthese ones when I visit.
You had to.
So everyone is equal.
Everyone cooks for eating.
Although the system\nis exemplary,
maybe for this reason, for the\nfact that it's so well defined,
so exemplary, the social impact\nof these Canadian collective
kitchens is proportionately\nmuch smaller
than those of Mexico or Lima.
Excessive preparation\nand the standardization
makes a larger\nparticipation unviable,
despite actually existing a\nbig demand to participate.
Collective processes entail\nthe risk of excesses,
[inaudible] and regulation,\nand the consequential exclusion
of those who basically\ndon't follow the rules,
or don't fit into the standard.
Also, the fact that cooking\nhappens not frequently,
just every two weeks, hardly\nsatisfies the amount of food
and cooking .
Needed so cooking\nin these kitchens
covers more than a nutritional\nand economical everyday need.
They cover, actually,\na social need.
This is probably one\nof the largest ones,
that they combine the\ncollective kitchen
with a restaurant, as well as\nother economical activities.
So the kitchen is extremely\nlarge and industrial.
So when you ask all\nthe participants, when
you ask most of the\npeople participating
in this organization,\nthey answer
that they do it to\nsocialize, basically,
to have a sense of\nbelonging in a community,
to form part of something.
So if in Lima and Mexico\nwe draw conclusions
about the capacity of collective\nkitchens to empower women,
as well as their capacity to\nturn domestic cooking into paid
labor, decreasing\nhousekeeping costs
and facilitating\nfamily care, Canada
is illustrative of the capacity\nof these collective kitchens
to establish social bonds.
And comparing them, I learned\nabout the consequences
of regulating, of\nexcessive regulation,
and of course of the\ndifferent ways of regulating.
This is collective\nkitchens in Canada.
So regarding the importance of\nthe aforementioned regulations,
I could research the\nurban implications
related to cooking\n[? revelations ?] visiting
Bangkok and Singapore.
Maybe stressing the relation\nof politics and architecture
is a twist, but\nnevertheless, it remains
interesting to analyze the\nethics of the regulations
and the deregulation of\neveryday life in a really
similar manner, and\neven contentious way.
So the actual\nmarket of Bangkok is
filled with apartments\nthat lack of kitchens.
Or if they do, those\nare hardly used.
This kitchenless society is\nbased on an extremely rich food
market that provides\ndelicious food at low cost.
From very minimal\nkitchens composed
of a pair of wicker baskets,\nwould sell precooked dishes
to fully equipped\nmobile kitchens
that sell complex\nrecipes cooked in situ.
Bangkok streets\nare covered daily
for a few hours in\nplaces of cook--
they are converted for a\nfew hours of places of food
production and consumption.
The fact that the\nstreet itself, which
is actually the street\nfood, which is actually
properly called hawker.
So the hawker food\nis good and cheap,
facilitates its\ndaily consumption,
and allowed to relieve daily\nhousekeeping annoyances,
and in some cases, avoid\neven to have a kitchen.
The economic efficiency of\nthese cooking infrastructures
relies on various factors.
Most of the hawkers\njust cook one dish.
So they are specialized,\nor at least a few dishes.
But the good ones want just one.
And the fact that they\ncook just one dish actually
allows them to\nrefine the recipe,
as well as to optimize\npurchases and infrastructures,
reducing radically the cost.
I learned that talking to them.
They are father and son.
The son is taking\nover the business.
He has turned 65.
And after 40 years\nhelping his father,
he's finally taking over.
His grand, grand,\ngrandfather was already
cooking there in the same spot,\ncooking the same delicious pork
with rice.
Even if, looking\nat the picture, it
doesn't look like a\nproper place to eat,
most of the ministers\nof Bangkok, of--
sorry-- Thailand,\neat here daily.
And when they open, they\nhave always a long line
to be able to eat\nthe delicious recipe.
It's actually a well-known\nfood cart and food place
to eat in Bangkok.
When I asked [? kam, ?]\nmy research assistant why
she never cooks at\nhome, she actually
took me here to understand.
And I radically and\ntotally really fast
understood the reality.
[? kam ?] was not able\nto cook this dish.
And it would be like for me,\nor for anyone in Thailand, able
to cook this dish.
First, you don't have the\naccess to that quality of pigs,
basically, because just this\nfamily have access to that.
And Just this family\ntoo have access
to a recipe that\nhave been working
for more than a century.
So even if you try it\nat home, forget it.
So considering that, me being\nSpanish, that I love cooking,
I understood why most\nof Bangkok's citizens
didn't cook at home.
Alongside with this, the\nfact that they are movable
allows them to avoid\nrents and high expenses,
decreasing extremely their\ncosts, their expenditures.
In cooking and\nconsumption terms,
the whole city is organized\nunder an illegal system.
Not illegal-- a legal.
Despite that these Kitchens\nare not officially regulated
by the government, a\nset of social agreements
allow them to operate\ndaily, being able even
to be provided properly\nwith electricity and water
supplies, many as well\nas many other supplies.
I was also fascinated by\nall the infrastructure
of these mobile kitchens\nthat pop up, hide
in garages during a few\nhours, pop up again.
And of course, the\nsocial agreement
implies the police that\nin an unofficial manner
regulates and help\nthe social welfare.
Lately, the government is trying\nto get control of the situation
by cleaning the\nstreets of hawkers.
When I traveled last\nyear in Bangkok,
I found it was actually\nthe topic to talk.
A radical step that most\ncitizens do not support,
and that may affect actually\nthe existing kitchenless market.
For me, it was\ncurious to compare
this way of living to\nhow Singapore faced
the same regulation\nprocess decades
ago in a successful manner.
So how to use regulation\nfor good and for bad.
After Singapore got\nindependence in the '60s,
a huge reform based on\nhousing took place in order
to face the existing crisis.
At the time, many\npeople were living
in unhygienic slums and\ncrowded, squatter settlements.
The prime minister,\nLee Kuan Yew,
founded then the\nhousing and development
board, the famous HDB, to\npromote social housing, which
progressively built and defined\nthe actual domestic landscape.
If at that time just\n9% of the population
were living in social housing,\nnowadays, more than 80%
of the population lives in a\npublic house, properly called
HDB homes.
The new housing developments\nincluded the regulation
of hawker food in order to\neliminate street cooking
for hygenic reasons,\nand at the same time
preserve the culture\nby regulating expenses,
thanks to a system of low rents.
It came out then\nthe hawker center
as a new architectural\ntypology that
would allow to allocate all\nthose movable cooking street
infrastructures under one roof.
Hawker centers are\nalways strategically
situated at the center of\neach housing development,
allowing them to be close and\naccessible to the inhabitants
of each community.
And thanks to the\ngovernmental support, rents
and infrastructure\nexpenses are kept low,
and consequentially,\nfood prices are also low.
By including these cooking\ncenters in public housing
developments, placing these\ninfrastructures in proximity
to homes, and regulating\nadequately their management,
the government has\nassured the access
to cook food on a daily basis\nand preserve the decreasing
domestic cost and annoyances.
Alongside the hawker center,\nthe so-called void deck
also came out.
In the first decades of the\nHousing Development Board,
they actually promoted\na type of block
which left the ground floor\nempty for community uses.
The type of occupation that\ncan be done in the void deck,
as you may imagine in Singapore,\nis well defined and regulated.
However, despite\nthat, all kind of uses
happen in a casual manner.
[music playing]
I realized at the end of the day\nthat I was attending a funeral,
that I didn't realize before,\nbecause I was playing cards
with them, eating.
There was a kitchen.
And it was really\nnice, actually.
So when the community\nagrees, all those programs
can be enclosed and\nformalized and turn permanent.
I could find some shared\nkitchens the neighborhood built
for daily use, as this one.
They are quite exceptional,\nbut despite that, they
have become a reference for a\nnew type of community kitchen
that the government\nis promoting nowadays.
This is GoodLife!
Makan.
It's a community kitchen\nplace on Marine Terrace,
and designed by DP\narchitects that open daily
to allow the elderly of the\ncommunity to cook collectively.
By elderly, I mean and\nlegally means they're over 55.
And Montfort Care, which\nis a private association,
takes care of the place.
And the government basically\ngives financial support,
providing, among other\nthings, food for cooking.
There are no fixed rules.
So no rules.
Just that the food is free\nand available, and a fridge.
And you just need to\nclean when you leave.
So cooking things\nare self-organized,
and internal packs and rules\nare rearranged permanently.
Self-management,\ntherefore, is encouraged,
and also through the\narchitectural design.
So this case, I would say\nthat it's similar as comedores
communitarios in Mexico.
The success of the\nSingaporean kitchen
typology relies on the fact\nthat the regulation is open
and allows citizens'\nappropriation.
After one year of\nits opening, it
has been proved that the\npublic expenses to support
the elderly have\ndecreased in that area,
thanks to the kitchen.
So it seems that the\ntypology will or may
expand in the future\nyears in Singapore.
I could [? answer ?] this\ntype of community kitchens
for caring.
So if we were looking before for\ncommunity kitchens for women,
in this case--
and for housekeeping,\nlabor, wages, in this case,
it's quite clear that there\nis an idea of caring, caring
of the other embedded.
And I could find this\ntypology also in Japan.
And this is a really\nnice story as well.
A couple of years ago,\nin Saitama, near Tokyo,
a quite exemplary case\ncalled Care Yoshikawa opened.
The architect, Chie\nKonno, was commissioned
to design the offices of\nan association dedicated
to the elderly, actually.
Entering the design\nprocess, she proposed
to install a large\nkitchen in the offices
to do errands for the\nelderly from time to time.
The kitchen was defined as\na large table, as you see,
where a stove and a point\nof water were installed.
And in front of\nit, a large window
was opened to allow visibility\nof the association activities.
What was surprising is\nthat, during the week
of the construction process,\nthe children of the neighborhood
began to appear by the space\ngradually, playing in it,
appropriating it.
So it turned out\nthat many of them
spent many hours\nalone while parents
were working until late, and\nended up eating really poorly.
So basically, children between\nthree years old and 13,
14 years old, they're alone\nfrom 5:00 to 11:00 PM mostly,
and they have to prepare by\nthemselves dinner as well
as doing the homework.
So suddenly, being aware of\nthis reality, a group of women
decided to start cooking\nregularly for the children.
Currently, they meet every\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday.
They cook dinner for\naround 30 children.
And at the end, what\nis really interesting,
is that actually adults\nalso have started
joining the dining ritual.
And the kitchen for\nchildren has ended up
being also a\nneighborhood kitchen.
So residents have started\ngrowing food on their balconies
needs to nourish the kitchen,\nand collective participation
allows offering low\ncost meals for everyone.
And what was actually\nreally surprising
is that this actually is\nnot the only case in Japan.
As this one in the\npicture as well.
So in the last\nyears, this new type
of community kitchen\nfor the children
have emerged in the country.
They are called "kodomo."
They're so numerous\nthat an association
called "Kodomo\nShokudo" was founded
in 2015 to group them all.
And nowadays, there\nare around 250 kodomos,
and they're expanding.
And I would say\nthat probably Japan
was the richest country in my\nresearch, an important fact.
Basically also\nregarding the fact
that I could find a wide\ndiversity of kitchen typologies
and realities.
That's kodomo kitchens.
But what's surprisingly actually\nis that Tokyo housing market
is filled by apartments with\nshared kitchens of all kinds.
Several companies, as the one\nthat we have in the image,
[? oak ?] House offer excusively\nto this new Japanese housing
typology, that as they\nconsider is becoming clearly
a market trend.
So at Oak house, last year,\nI could encounter, like,
seven real estate companies.
I didn't double check this year,\nbut they're really expanding.
So just taking a look\nto the impact on Tokyo,
this image shows just available\nrooms in available buildings
that they had in\nlast August 2018.
So imagine the ones\nthat are occupied.
And imagine that\nmultiplied per seven.
So it's really interesting to\nsee the wide range of building
types, from really large\ninfrastructures as these ones,
where the kitchen is shared\nby many, many inhabitants,
hundreds.
And they're called\nsocial houses, basically
because they're communicated as\nthat, as places to socialize.
I could even find ones that\nthey promise you that you
would be married in two years.
[laughter]
Truly.
It's Japan.
That happens.
To really small\nones, as these ones,
where a small group of people\nfrom four to seven people,
usually workers, working\npeople, shared the kitchens.
And these ones, they\ncall them "shared houses"
to distinguish their typology.
And among these small\nscale shared houses,
there are really famous ones\nthat have been widely published
online in Arch Daily, because\nthey are really, really
well-designed, as this one, the\nYokohama Apartments designed
by ON Design and Erika Nakagawa.
Or this one designed by Satoko\nShinohara and Ayano Ishimura.
Or this is a bit\nfreak one called
Nanjya, that alongside\nthe shared house,
they host a cafe on the tree.
So you can go and have\na nice coffee there.
That's Nanjya.
It's really nice.
To this one, that is\nprobably the newest and most
extraordinary one.
It's called SHIBUYA CAST.
It's an extremely expensive\nand elitist living community,
placed on the top floor of a\nnewly built tower in Shibuya
and designed by Naruse Inokuma.
And they call\nthemselves a co-family.
And it's actually really\ndifficult to get in.
I had the chance to be\nwith them for a while.
So diversity of types\nand rents proved
that the economical factor\nis not the main cause
of the success of the typology.
Despite the diversity, they\nhave all in common one thing--
their inhabitants choose to\nshare the kitchen in order
to belong to a\ncommunity and socialize.
It is said that\nthis social trend
is started in 1995, with the\nfirst big earthquake in Kobe.
Due to the natural disaster\nand its consequential social
crisis, it emerged\na feeling that
the contemporary\nJapanese society, which
a large part lives\nalone, consider
that the data says that\nmore than 50% in Tokyo
is living alone nowadays.
So this contemporary\nJapanese society
have not been able to keep--
sorry.
So the feeling is\nthat, actually,
this contemporary\nsocial society has not
been able to keep traditional\nneighborhood bonds,
erasing certain values\nof the social fabric.
This need for socialness boosts\na new culture of sharing that
has also been empowered\nby the medias, that
create imaginary values of\nsharing through films and TV
series.
The first one, the first\npopular one, I would say,
came out in 2000.
And it was a film\ncalled Room [? share. ?]
But then we could also recall\n2008 Last Friends serial,
or probably the most known\none, that if you have Netflix,
you can have access to it.
That is Terrace House, which\nis actually nowadays being
produced also by Netflix.
If I go backwards, let's take\na to look to the kitchens
that these people\nhave, and take a look
to Terrace Houses, imaginary.
You can tell that\nthere's something there.
So in most of these\nkitchens, the act of cooking
is not done collectively.
They might do it by-- they\nessentially share the space.
So they do it once in a while.
They don't cook daily.
The act of sharing\nthis domestic space
is already a strong\ntool that allows
to raise community\nbonds for good or bad,
accepting the values of\nthis dissent and conflict.
Despite that the Japanese\ncase is quite particular,
this sharing culture tendency\nis also a worldwide trend.
I cannot deny that.
And it's being widely\ndiscussed and debated.
And of course, housing is\nnot a part of all of these.
Cases as a well-known\n"we live in New York"
and similar\ncompanies prove that.
I traveled to China\nto visit You+.
You+ is probably the most\nsignificant housing company
that, understanding the\npotentialities of this
international sharing\nculture trend,
is promoting housing\nwith shared facilities.
They have already 18 complexes\nin different cities in China
that host around 5,000 people.
And they want to expand\nsoon internationally.
The founder of the\ncompany is Lei Jun,
who is the founder of the\nmobile company Xiaomi.
This could be an anecdote,\nhowever You+ uses clearly
Silicon Valley imaginary,\noffering these houses
to start-up entrepreneurs, and\npromising a better business
improvement through the\nuse of their social spaces
and netbooks.
And despite the\nvalues of the project,
it raises many\ndoubts and questions
regarding benefits\noutcome of all of this,
especially by the fact\nthat, despite using welfare
social vocabulary, the\neconomic outcome is clearly
capitalized for the benefit\nof just one company.
But let me go back to\nJapan to finish my story.
When Kobe's earthquake, a\ncollective housing group
was fine by the\ngovernment to come up
with developments for those\naffected by this disaster.
Among others, the professor\nand architect Ikuko Koyabe
worked in the Kobe area,\npromoting shared spaces
for the reconstruction.
10 buildings with\ncollective kitchens
were built at that time.
Most of them for the\nelderly, which were actually
the most needed ones.
And [? manafuneai, ?] the one\nthat you have in the picture,
was the one to be built. Despite\nthe success of the project,
the kitchens were abandoned, and\nnowadays they look like this.
Totally not in use.
The lack of adequate\nprocess of design,
as well as the lack of a good\nregulation, pushed the decay.
Basically, inhabitants never\nfelt that those shared spaces
were theirs.
This is another one\nwith shared kitchens.
And despite that, Ikuko Koyabe\nkept researching and promoting
the typology.
She wrote many books\nabout co-housing,
having a special interest\nin co-housing in Sweden.
She traveled there,\nregistered carefully
the Swedish experiences to\npush similar projects in Japan.
Finally, in 2003,\nthe first co-housing
was built up, this one\nthat we have in the image.
And after two years\nof design process,
in which all the\ninhabitants were included
to assure future appropriation\nand design [? equation, ?]
Kankan Mori was built up.
Kankan Mori occupies a\n[? pre-existing ?] second floor
in a building that\nexists already,
where there are 28 units\nof housing with kitchens.
And they have also many spaces\nshared as the kitchen, as well
as other types.
And after Kankan\nMori, after that,
it was founded, a collective\nhouses corporation
to promote this kind\nof co-housing in Japan.
And it has been quite\nactive in the last years,
building six buildings\nof co-housing.
And they are three or more.
They have three\nmore under design.
So as you see, the apartments\nhave a little kitchen.
And they share a big one.
In 2009, they could build\ntheir first new building,
fresh from scratch.
This one.
And usually these buildings are\noccupied by around 50 people.
That's kind of the\nnormal community size.
And they just share\ntwo, three meals weekly.
So clearly the share\ncooking and meeting
does not satisfy a daily\nneed, as I was mentioning
in previous Japanese cases.
So it's definitely a social act.
In the Japanese\ncase, it is clear
that sharing domestic spaces\nallow to define and raise
communities, empowering them.
This is also how the\nspace of the kitchen
operates in rural\nareas in Senegal.
And this is going to be\nmy last trip, and the one
that I explain tonight.
When I traveled\nto Dakar, I could
encounter many\napartments that share
a room as a space for cooking.
Usually, this tiny room is\nused by two to four families,
that they share the space,\nbut never the cooking devices,
never, never, never the fire.
And I'm saying that because\nhere fires are movable as well.
So it would be easy to share it.
This way of inhabiting comes\nfrom a rural tradition,
where the house is usually\ndefined by a set of rooms.
Let me go to it.
So as I was mentioning,\nthis way of inhabiting
comes from a rural tradition,\nwhere the house is usually
defined by a set of rooms\nthat enclose a patio.
This typology, called\n"maison impluvium"
came out to organize and\nprotect the members of a clan.
In those dwellings, usually\nmore than one family
lives, occupying several rooms.
The number of rooms, room\noccupation per family
varies depending on\nthe needs of the family
and depending on the timing.
And they all share--
so basically, I think\nthat it's really important
to reinforce, because I found it\nso impressive and interesting,
the fact that they can\nactually expand and increase
their living spaces.
And they always\nshare the center,
as actually a cooking place,\nwhere fires define different--
sorry.
Different cooking spots.
Here they're drawn.
And it looks like this.
So you can see that\nhere it's happening,
two cooking at the same time.
And she was actually\ncooking as well.
So three cooking\nat the same time.
So in this typology,\nthe collective kitchen
becomes a center of\na set of dwellings
that are in relationship without\nnecessarily [? leading to ?]
physical contact.
But by sharing one of their\npieces, they are related.
I brought a lot of these\nimages, because probably this
is the case that\nimpacted me the most.
And actually it\nwas the first trip
that I did at the beginning\nof these two years.
So if we abstract this\nidea and remove the food
from the equation, so\nforget about the cooking
and the kitchen, we\nwould have a city
composed of housing\nand collective rooms,
strategically located\nas satellite spaces
where any household\ncould happen.
A fragmentary\ndomestic city, a city
composed of diffuse homes,\nwhose limits vary depending
on the use of the inhabitants.
The Senegalese typology\ndates centuries back
and embodies a whole\narchitectural [? dilation ?]
of a vast African area,\nmade with humble technology
in a non-urban context.
And it's maybe one of the\ncases from this trip that
could be seen from\nfar away, from some
of those problems concerning\ndeveloped capitalist
and technological societies.
Nevertheless, this\nparticular case
renders visible how\narchitecture and society
are bonded and interact.
Overall, above all,\nmakes us questions
from tradition about the past\nand about its immediate future.
All these kitchen stories\nthat I explained tonight,
even if they are very diverse,\nshare some things in common.
All of them are attempts\nto reshape the relations
between public and private.
All of them are attempts\nto redefine our notions
of urban and domestic spheres.
And in a more and\nmore connected society
through this invisible\ntechnological landscape,
these architectural typologies\nappear as physical tools,
as a possible physical correlate\nthrough those invisible bonds.
All of those examples that I\nshowed tonight could be seen
not only as places\nof production,
and/or empowerment of\nwomen, of communities,
but maybe also as possible\nprecursors of new typologies,
able to transgress and\nredefine pre-established social
and especially\ndomestic conditions.
Thank you.
[applause]
[inaudible] a little and\nthen I'll turn it to the--
thank you so much, Anna.
I want to quickly\nturn the question
and answer to the\naudience, but just
to develop maybe\na little bit where
you were beginning to go at\nthe end, which I would say
is the big question\nabout how do you start
to move the analysis\npart of this project
toward design,\ntoward proposition?
And you begin to find patterns\nin common, looking maybe even
for, I don't know if typologies\nany longer is the right
word, but somehow patterns\nof form and occupation
that cross the very\ndiverse cultures.
And one of the things--
so I have a two part question.
The first is more culture\nand form or something.
The street food, the\nAsian street food,
seems to me in a way the\none that is so familiar,
and also maybe unchangeable.
I mean, unchangeable\nunless it turns
into something else entirely,\nor difficult to develop,
because it's so\nsuccessful, but it
depends on very\nparticular cultural
and agricultural\nsituation, access
to raw material, tradition\nof that kind of eating.
And it's very successful.
It seemed quite different to\nme than the Peruvian example,
or the Japanese, which\nare also very different.
But there, there were still\ncultural peculiarities,
but you could start\nto see formal patterns
in the architecture\ndevelop, which
might be continued and refined.
However, I guess what\nI'm wondering is,
are the cultural\nsituations so particular
that they limit very much\ndesign possibilities?
It seemed to me that\nin the wealthier cases,
let's say, you could find\nanalogs to the Japanese case,
I think, in New York,\nand even Boston.
You could certainly\nfind them in Seattle,
where 20-year-old, 30-year-old\nmen, in a lot of the cases,
like in Seattle, live\nalone in very small places,
and need collective kitchens for\nsocial and nutritional reasons.
But then it's not\nabout empowering women.
It's about empowering\n30-year-old tech guys, right?
And it seems very, very\nparticular, those situations.
Whereas in the Japanese\ncase, I think it's also--
they were very young.
And I do think there's\na whole generation who
marry later, if at all,\nwho often live alone
and need that social and\nnutritional combination.
So I don't quite\nknow the question,
but it has something to\ndo with, are the sort
of ethnographic limits so severe\nthat a design proposition is
actually inhibited by the\nparticular cultural situation?
Or actually are you beginning\nto see certain commonalities,
certain typologies\nthat might lead
to a more propositional phase\nof the project as opposed
to the analytic phase?
I mean, on purpose I wanted\nto finish with a floor plan.
I have hardly\nshowed floor plans.
Most were images.
I did that because\none of my struggles
was all the time\nto try to come out
with a kind of more\narchitectural design
perspective.
And at the same time, I\nwas struggling all the time
with the fact that I was\nputting on the same table
such a diverse reality\nthat in certain moments
they were not comparable at all.
And after these two\nyears of intensity,
I do realize, also\nafter doing a PhD,
that it's such a different\nway of looking at things.
When you jump from one\ncountry to another,
you eat, eat, eat all\nthe time, and you just
swallow references.
At the end, what you\nswallow is actually
an individual decision.
So at the end, it's the\nway I look at things,
and therefore the\nway I do understand
our contemporary condition.
And definitely my story is\nan occidental story that
comes from a certain culture.
And definitely the way that\nI have explained these things
today definitely\nhas a [? will ?]
to have a consequence\non our close proximity.
And if you ask me\nmore specifically,
definitely that's why I thought\nthat the Senegalese case,
not only because the\ntypology is so clear,
but also the fact that it\nwas the most ambiguous one.
It was really difficult\nto discuss for me,
going there and asking\nand researching, asking
their inhabitants how\nactually they inhabit.
Which was the Senegal?
The-- yeah.
All the houses that I showed are\nplaces in the south of Senegal,
in the area of Casamance.
Most of them are little towns.
Some of them are not that\nlittle, like 15,000 people.
But still, it was really\ndifficult to discuss,
for instance, what the\nfamily meant for them, which
kind of uses they were doing.
Even if they were doing\nexactly the same thing
as I was doing, sleeping,\neating, we are all the same.
But the way they understood\nthe house, it was so different,
that for me, I thought that\nsomehow it was the most--
the closest one to what I\nthink that it should be,
the future of our homes.
The corollary part,\nwhich also has
to do with moving\nit forward, I think
it's maybe a little\nunfair, because it's not
part of your story.
But one of the\nthings that obsesses
our students a little\nbit are technologies,
robotic technologies, new\nkinds of transportation,
including robotic or\nautonomous vehicles.
You mentioned a little bit\ndelivery in one of the cases,
I think the Peruvian case.
But is it your sense that--
mostly you emphasized in\nsitu, that the cooking
and eating both.
And this is why it works\nas a community, something
more than just food, but a place\nfor childcare and maybe even
elderly gathering.
It works because it's in\nsitu, in a collective space.
But can you imagine\nfuture delivery systems,
maybe when they become\neconomical, where
a collective production of\nfood could be delivered rather
than eaten in situ, could\nbe delivered and have
positive impact?
Did that ever maybe\nin the Japanese case
or in the more wealthy\ncases, did things like that
ever come up?
Actually, that there was quite a\ndiscussion in the 19th century,
here in New York.
Oh, is that, right?
Yeah.
For the hotels?
Yeah, for the hotels.
And honestly, it was a time when\nthe pneumatic tube came out,
as well as the\nelectric [? card. ?]
So all the newspapers\nwere talking
about how to use that\nin order to transport
deliveries, and especially\nalso cook and grow food.
So yeah, they tried\neven to ship soups,
to see if the tubes\nwere sealed enough
and the soups were\narriving properly heated.
So yeah, that happened.
Questions, comments for Anna?
Yeah, Andrew.
So I'm sort of intrigued\nby this last [inaudible]..
Hi.
Good to see you.
Oh, great, a microphone.
So I'm interested\nin following up
on Michael's line of thinking,\nin an admittedly somewhat
perverse way.
So forgive me, but\nall of your examples
are sort of\nbeautifully bottom-up,
and sort of community-driven.
And there is this incredibly\norganic conviviality.
Like, very close to\nthat, if we pursue
Michael's line of\nthinking, is actually
the idea of sort of mealtime\nconviviality as a service, that
could potentially be penetrated\nby capitalist inclinations.
And so I'm wondering if\nyou ever saw, in addition
to these sort of\nbottom-up community
spaces, its corporate other.
Is this also coming soon?
The case, the Chinese\ncase that I brought,
I brought it for that.
So my goal was also to show\nthat I'm aware of that reality.
And it's a double-sided coin.
It's really complicated\nto figure out,
because it is a discussion\nthat is on the table,
and it's really hard.
There's too many things,\nand it's really difficult
to understand.
But it's clear that\nthe use of language,
they appropriate\ncertain vocabulary
from certain policies\nin order to operate
in a different manner.
I was shocked by the\nfact that, for instance,
all the workers of the\ncompany live there.
So they work 24 hours, 24/7.
And that shocked me.
But what actually\nreally shocked me,
is that they were really proud.
Of course, the owners of\nthe company, I met the CEOs,
and they don't live there.
So yeah, there's a lot of risk.
And it's better to say\nit in between lines.
One more.
It's a long way away.\n[? it's not ready. ?] I
wondered if you had considered\nin this review the kibbutz
collective of the '50s\nand '60s in Israel,
and its evolution to today, as\na model for some of the things
that you've shown here.
Yeah, I have left out of\nthe scope a lot of cases,
that I guess I will continue.
I mean, it's been too much.
I promise I have to do this.
It has been the most difficult\nlecture I've done in my life.
I was really nervous,\nas you might have seen.
Basically, because it\nhas been really hard,
not only to try to sum\nup all that I have seen,
but also being\naware that there is
a lot that I haven't included.
Of course, I didn't\ninclude, for instance,
all of the European cases.
Like in Sweden, thanks to also\nthe visibility of the awards,
that also was actually\nreally helpful.
I rechanged all my\ninitial proposals,
because I started receiving a\nlot of emails of people that
actually live in\nthose topologies,
and they were inviting me to go.
And I avoid the European\ncases, because they
are much more studied.
And I focus more on those cases\nthat are not that well known.
I would say that, yeah,\nBangkok and Singapore are
the exception, but I just was\ncurious about the consequences
of street food, basically.
And because I tried\nat that moment
to establish a connection\nbetween recipes and shared
kitchens.
So to understand which\ncultures actually
have a culinary culture\nthat can just happen
if you share the kitchen.
And that's, for instance,\nin Senegal and the southeast
of Asia, but I\ndidn't talk about it
because there was too few time.
And I am aware of the kibbutz.
It might be a field of\nresearch for the close future.
Last question here.
Hi.
I was just wondering\nthat, after coming
back from all of this\nresearch to your practice
as an architect, particularly\nin a Western context
with certain--
I mean, I don't know if\nit's in Spain as entrenched
as it is here, but entrenched\nideas about private property,
and entrenched ideas about\nhow housing is to be built,
have you have you had any\nsuccess, strategically
as a practitioner, trying\nto like to implement some
of these more collective ideas?
And speaking to an\naudience of people
who are either practitioners\nof architecture
or are endeavoring to be so,\ndo you have any advice in terms
of how to maybe even sell it?
I really appreciate\nthat question,
because I'm going to come\nback to the floor plan.
I definitely was not\nclear enough before.
My fascination for this floor\nplan has many, many reasons.
And mainly, as I was\nstarting to introduce before,
it's because the idea\nthat generic is there.
So it was really\ndifficult for me
to understand how people live,\nbecause actually the space
was not clear, and also their\nculture was not clear for me.
So the combination of both,\nit was really confusing.
So I understood how a space can\nbe generic in the sense that,
due to its form and speciality,\nand even materiality,
you cannot even\ndistinguish its program.
And I thought that that was\nreally powerful in housing.
And it's something\nthat, before going to--
I actually traveled to Senegal\nbecause a former student
emailed me.
"Anna, what you\'re\ntalking is here."
So I went.
And she was totally right.
So this idea of\nthe generic space
was already there on the table\nas an interest in the office.
And we're still pushing it.
For instance, now I'm\npushing it farther.
So it's not only\nabout building spaces
that are generic\nin program, going
beyond the idea of equal rooms.
We know that, but\npushing that farther.
But also how to raise\ncollective spaces
that might not look\nlike collective
and produce collectivity.
So for instance,\nin Mexico, we're
building now a\nsocial housing block,
alongside with other architects,\nthat HHF is teaching here
this semester.
So HHF is also building\nwith us, and [inaudible],,
and [? dogma. ?] And thanks\nto the Tatiana Bilbao.
Well, a big group.
We're designing a\nlot of housing there.
And our block is placed\nin a neighborhood
that deals with drugs.
It's a quite violent\nneighborhood.
Even if they don't consider\nit, I do consider it.
To the point that you cannot\nhave a car in the street.
And we do know that they're\ngoing to fence our open spaces,
but we're designing\nthem in order
to force that to happen,\nto force a discussion
and a dialogue\nbetween neighbors.
So there are huge terraces\nin front of generic rooms.
And those terraces are generic\nin the sense that exactly it's
difficult to tell if they are\ncollective or private, if they
are individual or for one\nfamily or for two families.
So we hope that that's going\nto force them, actually,
to an active dialogue.
And we'll see the consequences.
We're really lucky,\nbecause the government
is allowing us to try.
Sometimes it's really\ndifficult to do that.
I'm just impressed at how\nthe original proposal really
focused on kitchens.
And housing, of course,\nhas to be there,
but it was a kind of corollary.
It was really about kitchens.
And now it's amazing\nto me, the way even
the stress on where the raw\nmaterial food comes from,
how close is it, or how is\nit delivered to the place,
how community space, how\nages from the children
to the elderly,\nhow the community
space deals with all these.
The kibbutz example\nis a good one,
insofar as there has to\nbe a kind of totalizing
analysis of all these factors.
When it really started with,\nlet's say, just the kitchen,
it ends up with an entire city\nsector, if not a city itself.
And I think that systematicity\nthat you uncovered
was really, really helpful.
So thank you, Anna.
Thanks for coming back.
Thank you.
[applause]
