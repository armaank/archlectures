Good evening.
I'm just going to make\na few brief remarks.
Michael Hayes is\nreally the person
who will be introducing\nKen Frampton.
So, according to him,\nI'm the warm up act.
So I would be just like\nliterally a couple of minutes
to welcome you all.
It's really wonderful\nto see everyone here.
And it's, of course, incredible\nand a very happy occasion
to be able to welcome\nboth Ken and Silvia.
This week, Ken Frampton\nand Silvia Kolbowski
are the Senior Loeb Visiting\nLoeb Fellows here at the GSD.
As you know, it's\nbeen a few years
since we established\nthe Senior Loeb program.
And during this time, we've had\npeople, including Ulrich Beck,
Arjun Appadurai, Richard\nSennett, and Saskia Sasses,
David Harvey, Catherine Boo,\nTod Williams and Billy Tsien,
Richard and Ruthie Rogers,\nincluded in this program.
And it's been a really fantastic\nopportunity for the school
to have scholars\ncome and spend a week
and participate in\ndifferent events.
So getting both Ken and\nSilvia is a special treat.
While they're here\nthey're both going
to participate in\na number of events.
In fact, Silvia will give a\ntalk tomorrow at 1 o'clock,
which will be in\nthe Gropius room.
This talk is entitled\n"Monument Which Is Not One."
And both John\nPeterson, who has been
a co-host during this\ntime together with Michael
Hayes, Silvia Benedito, and with\ngreat support from Sally Young,
they're all going\nto be participating.
But tomorrow, I think,\nJohn and Silvia Benedito
will also engage Silvia\nKolbowski in discussion
after her talk in\nthe Gropius room L08.
Also there will be other\ndiscussions and collaborations
with the art design and public\ndomain cohorts here at the GSD,
as well as meetings\nthat Ken will
have on Thursday with the\nthird semester corps with Eric
Haller and others.
And probably, an event also with\nJohn May and the [inaudible]
students from the history\nand philosophy of design,
as well as other sessions,\nI think, that will be held.
And of course, the Loeb's are\nat the center stage for this.
Some of them are here\nsitting behind Ken.
And they will be the\nbeneficiaries of conversations,
dinners, and things like that\nthat will take place also
during the week.
So please welcome\nProfessor Michael Hayes,
who will introduce\nour speaker tonight.
Thank you.
[applause]
Thanks, Moshem.
This is a real honor.
And in some ways it's very\neasy, at least part of it,
because I've been following\nKenneth Frampton's work, not as
long as I can remember but as\nlong as I can remember well.
And it was very\nimportant, very formative
for a lot of us\nof my generation.
It all seemed so\nclear with hindsight.
The journal Oppositions\nbegan publication in 1973.
And in the first few\nissues each of its editors
issued a brief\nposition-taking proposal
that would be for both\ntheir interpretive agenda
but also for design\npractices that each of them
would support in\nsubsequent issues.
So for example, there were\nonly three main editors then.
Mario Gandelsonas offered.
It was kind of an amazing essay.
Mario's too offered a kind of\nsemiotic triangle of the three
dominant design\ntrends at that moment.
One of the first so-called\nsemiotic analyses
of architecture.
Peter Eisenman followed\ncharacteristically
with a corrective to Mario\nof how to understand his way.
Singular, right.
But before that, in actually\nthe first editorial,
Kenneth had offered a reading,\nthe now famous reading
of Heidegger's building,\ndwelling, thinking essay.
And it was that essay that,\nagain, with hindsight, we now
know inaugurated a career along\nwith just a few others, Alan
Calhoun, Mario, a few\nothers, defined what we still
call contemporary theory,\ncontemporary architecture
theory.
And for that, we thank him.
Actually, I thank him\nbecause, in fact, I
wouldn't get a paycheck had\nhe not written that essay.
I'm the professor of\narchitecture theory.
The point is to claim for\nhim that inaugural moment.
Now it was a decade later,\nin this amazing collection
by Hal Foster, the\nanti aesthetic,
this was where Craig\nOwens published
"Feminism and Postmodernism."
It was the first feminist\ntheoretical critiques.
Frederick Jameson\npublished the first version
of what became the famous\npostmodernism essay.
And Kenneth published\nwhat many regarded
for a very long time\nas his masterwork,
an essay entitled "Towards\na Critical Regionalism,
Six Points for an\nArchitecture of Resistance."
Kenneth called\ncritical regionalism
a category oriented towards\ncertain common features that
were already in place.
That is to say, it was supposed\nto be a descriptive essay,
or that was the claim.
But at the same time, in\npractice and influence,
critical regionalism was\nvery much an aesthetic if not
an outright movement,\nwhich is to say
it had a dimension\nthat was not only
descriptive but\ncourageously prescriptive.
And I emphasized that\nbecause since that essay
no theorist of subsequent\ngenerations, my own included,
have really been so prescriptive\nas that essay turned out to be.
I find that very interesting.
It was like the very modernist\navant-garde movements
that Kenneth presumably\nwas turning against.
The essay was explicitly--\nthis is not my word,
it\'s Kenneth\'s-- "rear guard."
it was deliberately\nretrogressive
but future oriented.
And that dialectic, for\nme, is an important one.
I think it might come back a\nlittle bit in the discussion
tonight.
That is, it sought to be\ndescriptive of features
of certain, what he regarded as\nauthentic works of architecture
as they already existed.
But then went on to suggest,\nbased on those parameters,
for the production\nof future work.
And this to me as was the\nremarkable critical method.
And it's something that many\nof us, I would say most of us,
have attempted again\nand again ever since.
But then by the\n1990s, and I would
say probably for most\nof the students here,
the idea of an architecture\nof resistance came finally--
and in some ways, the\nsuccess of the essay
in terms of its influence on\npractice was also, in some way,
began a kind of flattening.
As it got more popular it\nalso got more flattened.
The idea of an\narchitecture of resistance
came to be regarded not\nonly as old fashioned,
this is 1990, sort of\nnot dot.com enough.
It was too anti-capitalist.
It was too leftist.
But more seriously, an\narchitecture of resistance
came to be regarded\nas impossible.
That the desire for resistance\nwas regarded as just a symptom.
No longer it could\nbe a prescription,
it was just a symptom\nthat reflected
the pathos of a moment in which\nit seemed we would no longer be
able to come up with\nalternative practices,
progressive practices,\npractices of resistance.
So all of this, and\nthis is coming now
for what, to me,\nwas the crux, as I
was thinking about tonight.
All this was in\nthe back of my mind
when Black in Design Conference\nwas launched just a couple
of weeks ago.
Black in Design announced\nits themes for this year,
designing resistance,\nbuilding coalitions.
That really struck me.
I immediately\nthought of the essay.
I wonder if the organizers\nor the people who
came up with the conference\nknew about the essay.
What I saw in Black in Design--
I'm still watching\nthe videotapes--
it was an amazing--
in the face of the\nsituation we're
in, the enormous\nstruggle we're in,
there was an\noptimism and a desire
to hope in the Black\nin Design Conference
that, for me, given\nthe legacy of a kind
of critical negative thinking,\nhas put Kenneth's essay
in a very different light.
Kenneth taught us ways to think\nin architecture of resistance.
But it occurred to me, as I put\nthese two instances together,
that Kenneth also taught\nus something that we
didn't recognize at that\nmoment that maybe we're
recognizing now.
That architecture's\nrelation to the world
must not only be resistant,\nsubversive, adversarial,
although, at moments\nit has to be that too.
But architecture is\nactually quite generous.
It can also amplify, replenish\nour desire to get things right,
amplify the attempt to\ndesign in an actively
liberatory and\ntransformational way.
And that's a part\nof that early essay
that I think we\nweren't cognizant of.
We couldn't see it\nthat way at the time.
Design can be quite generous.
It offers a more capacious\nvision of our world that
might be able to do better\njustice to what I think
is the enthusiasm and the\nenergies that actually bring
our students here in the\nfirst place to architecture
and design.
And for that, we thank Kenneth.
Welcome.
[applause]
Thank you.
Amazing.
I want to thank a few people.
Of course, [inaudible]\nDean Mostafavi,
who invited jointly\nSilvia Kolbowski
and myself to be\nSenior Loeb Fellows.
And then I should also think\nJohn Peterson and Sally Young,
who are inseparable from\nthe Loeb Fellowship,
and who organized our stay\nhere, and all of the logistics,
et cetera, and welcomed\nus this afternoon.
And finally, I would\nlike to, of course,
thank Michael, an old colleague,\nfor his very, what can I say?
rich presentation\nof my past sins.
And also this challenge\nto address this evening
the idea that\narchitecture can be
transformational and liberative\nas well as resistant.
And I will try and honor\nthis angle, so to speak.
Yes, well, I'm well aware\nthat here at the GSD
I am on hallowed ground\nin more ways than one.
For this was the cradle\nof urban design, I think.
[inaudible] Jose Luis Sert.
And it's also, in a\nsense, the birthplace
of landscape architecture.
If I'm not mistaken,\nthe first degree
in landscape architecture\nin the States
was inaugurated here by\nFrederick Law Olmsted.
More recently, it's\nalso been the cradle
of landscape urbanism.
And by virtue of the work of\nCharles Waldheim, conceived,
I think, as a mediatory\necological strategy,
which has been variously pursued\nin the States and elsewhere
since, I suppose, the mid-'90s.
As it's fairly well known, this\nlast has its ultimate origin,
I believe, in the\nteachings of Ian McHarg
in the University\nof Pennsylvania.
Waldheim, having been,\nif I recall correctly,
the pupil of James Corner.
And Corner, in his turn, having\nbeen the pupil of [inaudible]
My theme this evening,\n"Megaform as Urban Landscape"
has something of its origin\nhalf a century ago when
my initial experience, for\nthe first time, I think,
of the urbanized region of\nthe scale of the Boston,
Washington corridor was\nimpressed upon my mind
by actually taking a helicopter\nfrom Newark Airport at 5:00
on a summer's evening,\nor early fall evening,
and back to Kennedy Airport\nto go fly back to London.
And I'd never seen so\nmuch electrical power--
this is mid-'60s-- or gasoline\nburning before my eyes as one
of those sublime panoramas that\nyou are never likely to forget.
There are two things, actually,\nthat coincided at this time.
One was this experience\nof the urbanized region.
And the other was Hannah\nArendt's book, The Human
Condition, which first\nappeared in '58, 1958,
and for which I will, I\nthink, never really recover
in terms of the\nway she influenced
my total attitude to\narchitecture and to life
in general, I think.
Where the first, the\nurbanized region,
made me aware of the process\nof continuous, never-ending
urbanization, the\ncontinual assembly
of totally unrelated\nfreestanding objects.
The other introduced me to the\nprovocative phrase, "the space
of human appearance," with\nall the political and cultural
connotations that this implies.
And thus, I first became\npreoccupied with something
that has haunted me ever since.
Namely, that by what\nmeans, both as a society
and as a profession,\nwhere may we
hope to be able to maintain\nspaces of human appearance
within an exceptionally\nprivatized and highly
commodified process of\nunending urbanization.
In which, as Mies van der\nRohe once put it laconically
in the mid-\'50s, I quote, "That\nis why we can\'t build cities
anymore.
All cities, planned cities.
It goes on like a\nforest, and we shall
have to learn how to\nlive in the jungle
and even do well be that."
This is the mid-'50s.
Coming here on the plane, I\nhappened to have it with me
for obvious cribbing reasons,\nCharles Waldheim's 2006
Landscape Urbanism Reader.
And I opened the page at\nGrahame Shane's pithy essay,
which carried this image\nby Cedric Price, one
of Price's typical\nwitty legacies,
with three states of urbanism\nrepresented by a boiled egg,
in terms of the antique and\nmedieval city surrounded
by a wall.
Of course, that's a bit\ntoo three-dimensional
for the other two.
But in any case,\nthe wall, of course,
being the shell of\nthe egg, boiled.
Then, of course, the fried egg\nbeing 17th to 19th centuries.
And then scrambled eggs\nbeing the 20th century,
and, of course, also\nthe 21st century.
And the fried egg obtaining for\nthe 17th and 19th centuries,
as you can clearly read.
I'm going to give\nyou an account of how
I came to get involved with\nthis question of megaform
as urban landscape, which is,\nof course, coinage of my own
and which needs a certain\nelaboration, I think.
So it's tough for me.
In 1978 the history for\narchitecture and urban study
is that no kind of unbelievable\noffbeat, miraculous place
founded by Peter Eisenman\nin '78 with Stanford
Addison as an\neditor, the Institute
produced a book called\nOn the Streets, published
by MIT Press.
And various characters\nhanging around the Institute,
and some also here in\nCambridge contributed articles
to that anthology, in a way.
Rather large anthology.
And I contributed a piece\ncalled "The Street As Continuous
Built Form."
And when I thought about\npresenting this issue
this evening, "Megaform as\nUrban Landscape," I thought,
maybe I should step back and\ntalk just briefly, very briefly
about the continuous\nstreet as built form.
And this, of course, is\nthe Smithson's Golden Lane,
montage down to\nbombed out Coventry.
It's 1952, when\nGarden Lane first
were premiered in the gardening\ncompetition for housing
in London.
And here, of course, is supplied\nto Coventry as literally that,
as a continuous built form.
And it also contains a street.
In '61, almost\ndecades later, they
would do this London Road study.
And here one notices,\nit's not a street
but it is a spine which\nhas a auto route in it,
and designated bus lanes,\nand parking underneath,
and also a kind\nof shopping mall.
And of course, they would even\ncoin the term "land castles."
This thing, of course, produced\nland castles almost by itself
because it would divide\ncertain sectors of the city
from the next.
But this preoccupation\nwith roads and streets,
I think, and it\nhas an old history.
And I will try and show it\nvery briefly during the course
of this discussion\nabout megaform.
When architects, I think--
well, of course, I am\nthinking of Le Corbusier
at the end of the 1920s--
began to think that the\nonly, what can I say?
modern, reliable civic\nwork that would actually
mark the landscape and\ndefine it was in fact,
the auto route, which\nbegins, of course,
with his Plan Obus of 1929.
And at one scale, that was\nSmithson's preoccupation.
There's another scale.
It was the street as the\nelevated street, which
they also, I think with\nconsiderable naivete,
thought to compare to the\nstreet, the traditional street,
the traditional\ndouble-sided street.
And this clearly was not\nthe traditional double-sided
street.
And also because it was\ntotally disconnected
from the urban fabric.
Of the same\ngeneration, of course,
this is work by Shadrach Woods.
This is in fact, Shadrach\nWoods' Karlsruhe.
And there, of\ncourse, he's trying
to come to terms with the\nreal problem for all streets.
Once the automobile\narrives, is how do you
accommodate both\npedestrian movement
and the space of appearance\nin the street charged
with automobiles.
Of course, in the\nearly '50s, streets
were not so charged with\nautomobiles as they are now.
But this project in Karlsruhe,\nwhich is somewhat later,
where he tries to put parking\nbehind the whole urban
development, which is really\naddressing this linear street
in the center of Karlsruhe.
And he would develop\nthat further.
Here you see that this is the\npoint of the active street
with residences on the street\nand the quiet perimeter block
interior to which cars\nwould be attached.
Sorry, by implication, of\ncourse, automobile-free.
In theory, of\ncourse, never built.
But he would develop\nit into another project
that I think is more interesting\nfor Hamburg's steel soup.
There again, this is a street\nas continuous built form
with parking garages\nbrought in behind it.
Also, not realized.
And will go on with\nthings not realized.
But in terms of continuous built\nform the, street as continuous
built form realized, of course,\nthere is the much more concrete
and realized, also\npre-automobile, of course.
This is a 1917 plan\nby Bell [inaudible]
for Amsterdam south,\nwill get built out.
This is, I think,\nAmsterdam south in 1934,
where the perimeter blocks,\nof course, create streets.
And again, the mass\nenergy of the automobile
at that date in [inaudible]\nsimply doesn't exist.
And this led me to be interested\nin a project like this,
for example.
Also part of the same idea\nof the street as continuous
built form, which is Barton\nMyers and Jack Diamond's
building for the University\nof Alberta in Edmonton, where
the Galleria as a\ncontinuous internal street
is adapted to\nstudent residences.
Sorry.
And this is a section.
And of course, the\nodd thing about that
is that typologically,\nthe Galleria
is a parasitical type\nthat's woven interstitially
into the urban fabric.
But here they are\nborrowing the type
and making it into a\nfreestanding building.
So this is not only the street\nas a continuous built form,
of course, pedestrian\nstreet only,
but a building, it produces its\nown kind of unique building.
The greatest thing\nabout it, of course,
is it discontinuous from the\nrest of the university campus.
So that was a sort\nof prologue for me.
And I thought I\nwould indulge in it
here just to show you that I\nhave been nursing something
like this in my head\nfor quite some time.
This, of course, is Reyner\nBanham's Megastructure.
And of course, it\nbrings up the issue,
what is the difference between\nmegastructure and a megaform?
In fact, on the front\ncover of this book
is Archigram's plug-in city.
And of course, I think\nthe main issue, of course,
is that Banham is stressing the\nstructure rather than the form.
The avant-garde as\nstructure, one might say.
And this is edgy.
Banham's Megastructure\ncomes out in '76.
And a big feature early on\nin the rather elaborate text
in that book is Paul Rudolph's\nLower Manhattan Expressway
project, 1970, which never\ngets to be built, fortunately.
One of Robert Moses last\nmasterpieces, I suppose.
But more interesting\nfor me is this,
Hans Hollein's 1964\naircraft carrier,
which is very definitely\na megaform, in my opinion.
And also, one of the\nattributes of a megaform
is, of course, its landscape\npotential, I think.
In putting this\nargument forward,
I think, is important to--
there's a great remark made\nby Francoise Choay, where
she says, the auto route\nsystem, if it were not
for graphic signs, would\nnot be negotiable at all,
which is a self-evident truth.
But unlike the traditional\ncity or the medieval city,
where you could, of course,\nnegotiate through landmarks,
and I think this question of\nthat aspect of the megaform
to function as a landmark is\nperhaps one of its virtues.
And you see that part\nof the accommodation
is very interesting in the\ndouble way he shows it.
He kind of sinks\nthe aircraft carrier
into the ground and the actual\nbody of the building itself
is subterranean.
Fumihiko Maki is\nvery much involved
with the idea of megastructure.
He publishes a text with Gyorgy\nKepes, a project for Shinjuku,
where the megaform is\nin fact, of course,
a vast podium on which you can\nbuild virtually everything.
And needless to say,\nthe Rockefeller Center
is also a megaform.
Well, perhaps one of the\nmost remarkable megaforms
in relation to a piece of\nhistorical fabric by then,
in relation to\nthe greatest city.
It has this relationship\nto the greatest city.
The extraordinary\nthing is the breakdown
of the form to the\nscale of Fifth Avenue.
And there are earlier examples.
And I've often nursed\nthe idea of trying
to make a comparison between\nthe tale of the Palais-Royale
at the end, let's say, most\ncomplete, as we know it
now by the end of the first\nquarter of the 19th century
in the center of Paris.
Definitely a city in miniature.
Much more a city in\nminiature, in fact,
than the Rockefeller\nCenter would ever
be because nobody actually ever\nlived in Rockefeller Center,
where, in the case\nof Palais-Royale
people lived on the perimeter.
In fact, the Palais-Royale\nwas developed twice
because it was first this\nenclosure and then there
was a second layer\nbuilt. It was first
built by Cardinal Richelieu\nin the 17th century.
And within the\nPalais-Royale, of course,
there is then the\nGalerie d'Orleans,
which is the idealized arcade,\nthe intel street that we
see here.
The internal street\nmarketing not for goods.
But the Palais-Royale\nwas also something else.
It was a free port inside the\ncity, a kind of free trade
center, basically.
And also a political center.
It was a place of subversive\njournalism, conversation.
As someone once said,\nit was the place
in which anything under\nthe rubric of commerce
could be conducted, including,\nof course, prostitution.
And also, the\nrevolution begins there
with Camille Desmoulins in 1789.
Shown here urging the\nrebellious populace of Paris
to revolt, to start\nthe revolution.
And here, 1815, other\nkinds of commerce.
Just at the moment,\nNapoleon is about to be
defeated at Waterloo.
But the idea of a perimeter\nblock as a kind of enclave
is one way of interpreting\nthe idea of megaform.
And here, Fernand\nPouillon in '57, I think,
produces his block in\nAlgiers called [? demille ?]
[? cologne ?] is his nickname.
He immediately creates a\nplace against the chaos
that surrounds it.
Some of which, of course,\nis also designed by him.
Or this, which is 1917.
Hans Poelzig.
It's a House of Friendship\ncompetition for Istanbul
to be paid for by the\nGerman government.
In fact, never built.
But here, the idea\nof megaform, I think,
it may be even kind of\nshocking since it's obviously
competing with the\nminarets of major Mosques.
And you see it here.
You could say it\nis also by Poelzig,
an example of German\nexpressionism, which clearly
was not only just\nbecause of the site
but you look at other work of\nPoelzig at this time influence
by Arabic or you could\nsay Islamic architecture.
And then, I have\nalready alluded to this,
or I began to allude to it.
Which is the 1929 project of Le\nCorbusier for Rio de Janeiro,
which is where he posits the\nidea that the congestion of Rio
is such that the only way of\nliberating this congestion is
to actually build an\nauto route that know
irrigates the entire complex.
And you put the\nautomobiles on top
of the building and stack\napartments beneath it.
And another version of the same.
And then, of course, it\nbecomes the inspiration
for Plan Obus for\nAlgiers of 1930,
where, in fact,\nthe auto route now
is again on top of the\nlong, snaking block
entering into the\ncenter of the complex.
And then in the middle of\nthe adapted [inaudible]
blocks here.
That's the point, I\nsuppose, about megaform
is that he's actually\nturning it into a landscape
really, into an urban landscape.
And something of\nthe same will be
played with by Jacob\nBakema in his project
for Tel Aviv, where he will\nreally adapt the Corbusier
notion to create a new\ncenter for Tel Aviv
at the port of Jafa.
This is actually the\nexisting Dizengoff Circle,
slightly augmented.
And also bringing auto\nroute into the whole system,
multilevel auto route.
This is the famous\nWhite City of Tel Aviv.
Five-story walk up, white\ncubic houses, mostly designed
by German emigre architects.
[inaudible] keep it like\nthat in [inaudible]..
And here you see the attempt\nto the argument about scale,
trying to relate the auto route.
And again, to consider\nthe auto route
the most generative element.
But not to stand by itself but\nto energize a total complex .
And he will, a few years\nlater, apply the same thing
to Amsterdam,\nso-called Pampas Plan.
Never built, of course.
You could compare it certainly\nto the metropolis in Japan,
building on the water.
Above all, Kikutake.
But also to Tange's\nTokyo Bay of 1960.
Perhaps that's the\nimportant thing.
Tokyo Bay, as it\nwere, has the nerve
to build out into the water.
And it's clear\nfrom Kansai Airport
that the Japanese do know how\nto build out into the water.
Artificial ground,\nof course, which
is what Maki had been\nproposing for Shinjuku.
There, of course, on dry land.
In the case of the Kansai\nAirport, Renzo Piano.
Actually, the reason why\nthe Japanese built out
there, that's very interesting\nin terms of public opinion
is because the pressure\nnot to have jets taking off
in the middle of\nthe Kansai District
was such that they\nwere forced, in fact,
to build the new airport\nout in the water.
And there, technical\nproblems include
having to jack up the\nbuildings all the time
because the [inaudible]\nof ground is, in a sense,
always sinking.
God knows what happens with\nthe current emerging climate
change and the airport.
Not probably no longer\nadvisable as a technique.
This is also Pampas plan.
It shows the\nrelationship, of course,
with the existing Amsterdam\nand the way in which he would
have carried out the expansion.
Definitely a megastructure,\nyou could say.
But I think it's the\nform that intrigues
me, the continuity, the\nhorizontal continuity
of the form.
And then there are\nbuilding types.
And I will come back\nto this at the end.
I think there are certain kinds\nof programs, singular programs,
or anyway hybrid programs\nthat lend themselves
to this strategy, in a way.
Because as soon as I do,\nI am putting it forward
as a hypothetical\nstrategy for overcoming
the problem the [? apparia, ?]\nso to speak, of urban design
and urban planning.
Now I remember being\nin this building.
No, maybe in the old one.
It's a long time ago.
Listening to Jose\nSaletan say, well,
what will become of the surgery\nif it's never practiced?
This was a conference\non urban design.
Jose Luis Sert was able to\nachieve some remarkable pieces
of [inaudible]
That's the important\nthing, I think.
They were always\nurban interventions.
And I'm playing around with\nthis megaform as urban landscape
idea.
Also, with the idea\nof intervention.
The real option is to intervene\nin the unending megalopolis
of chaotic freestanding\nobjects, none of which
are related to any other object.
So that's what's\nlying behind this.
I think I have to admit\nit's some kind of obsession
in a way.
But then I think, there\nare certain types.
For example, above\nall stadia, which
lend themselves\nto being rendered
as though they are landmarks.
And this one in\nparticular, which is 1953,
Vogelweidplatz in Vienna, by\nAlvar Aalto, where the building
itself takes on the character\nof a kind of escarpment or mini
mountain.
And that thing is formed,\nof course, by the--
well, here you see it--
is formed by the structure,\nthe catenary structure
designed, as a matter of\nfact, by his engineer's son.
I think it wins the competition.
But, of course, it never gets\nbuilt, as is often the case.
Here, the space of\nappearance, by the way,
is not only inside the arena,\nbut also in the forecourt here
and, of course,\nin all the other--
it's a kind of mini\nOlympic intervention.
Another program is, of course,\nthe roadworks themselves
or parking in the\ncenter of the city.
And this is about the same date\nas the project for Helsinki
for the Tulu area in Helsinki\nnext to the railroad entry
into Helsinki and into\nEllis [inaudible] terminal.
He makes make this into a\nkind of total landscape,
the auto route entering\ninto this terraced operation
here is concentrated parking\nmade into a landscape.
You can see it's here.
Actually, if you\nknow the city, that's
the National History Museum.
And here is the Saarin terminal.
And this is the auto route\nentering into the thing.
The rails are here.
And these are the terraced\nmass parking garages.
More of the same.
This is the existing lake,\nrails, auto route coming in.
This is the National Museum.
That's the Parliament.
And the only one building\nhe built of this, of course,
has been [inaudible],,\nthe concert hall.
Otherwise, none of this\nwas carried through.
But the idea was, of course,\na kind of cultural band
looking out over the water.
So we come to Arthur\nErickson, Vancouver.
The university just\noutside Vancouver,
the Simon Fraser\nUniversity, which
is built on a kind of natural\nacropolis outside Vancouver
and which he handles as\nthough it is an acropolis.
So now, of course, we\ncome to the university
as a potential\nprogram for megaform.
And you see it very much here.
Here, of course, my famous\nspace of public appearance.
And there's faculty buildings\ncreating another space
at a higher level.
And you see how the whole\ncomplex, of course, also
including parking\nclimbs up the site
to this ultimate\nmonumental courtyard.
This is the section in\nthe other direction.
So it's built on a kind\nof natural acropolis,
the character of\nwhich it amplifies.
A kind of gallery\nof space almost.
And you're inside,\nunderneath the space frame
roof, which you saw.
Which was sketched out\nhere and built out here.
It's an architect that I\nthink has never been realized.
I think he has never\nbeen given his due.
I'll come back to him,\nI think, a little later,
also in Vancouver.
Then we come to--
well, here we are.
Robson's Square, which is\nin this case, the program
is a law courts\nand a municipality
made into a new synthesis with\na landscape that is literally
implanted on top of it,\nincluding these two waterfalls
and this stepped walkway.
In fact, the uncomfortable\ncoinage is the word "stramps,"
combining ramp and\nsteps together.
And the landscape designed by\ncourt Cornelia Oberlander, who
is the third woman to graduate\nfrom the Landscape Architecture
Department in the GSD,\nalong with Dan Kiley
and Garrett [inaudible],,\nand somebody's name.
I think Rogers [inaudible]\nThree males and one woman.
And she has always worked with--
well, he's no longer\nalive-- but until his death,
she collaborated with Erickson.
And I value this\nthing enormously
because, in fact, it creates\na new spine for Vancouver.
It almost functions, I\nthink, in the intensity
to develop Vancouver--
this is '86, some time ago--
as a kind of new spine in\nperforming a function not
unlike that of Rockefeller\nCenter, I think, in New York.
And here you see the space\nframe roof over the--
these are the law\ncourts, in fact, here.
This is a common public foyer.
And then underneath\nis the municipality.
And the municipality,\nof course, extends out.
The whole thing ending in an\nexisting Beaux-Arts building
here, finally stepping\ndown to this building.
A plan of the same thing.
Here's the Beaux-Arts\ncomplex and here are
the stramps coming down.
And you can see how this\nwhole thing is landscaped.
Yeah, these are\nthe stepped ramps.
More of the same.
And in Switzerland we\nencounter something similar.
This is Luigi Snozzi\nand Mario Botta.
I think this is 1972.
It's a project for the main\nrail terminus in Zurich.
At the time, it only consisted\nof the old 19th century
building and these\ncovered platforms.
But they, or rather,\nyeah, I think
we could say they\nproposed building
this new facilities for the rail\nand some side development here,
[inaudible] writes.
And it's interesting\nthat this rail thing
comes in to the\nterminals and breaks this
or goes over this small\ntributary to the [inaudible]
And then they\nbuild this building
and they put trees on\ntop, somewhat naive also,
to echo the line of trees\non either side of this
to create a kind of landscape\nlink to repair in a way
that the rail cutting by\nputting a bridge over it.
Of course, I'm showing you\nthings that were both built
and unbuilt. This perhaps, not\nsurprisingly, was not built.
The interesting thing,\nnot self-evident,
is that this is a parking\ngarage here in relation
to this new office facility.
So it unites the 20th century\ninfrastructure of automobile
with the rail infrastructure.
The Swiss are very good at this.
I've never seen anything\nmore ingenious and brilliant
than the link between\nKloten Airport
in Zurich and the totals\nSwiss railway system.
It's an extraordinary\nconnection,
which also depends on an\nextraordinary Swiss invention,
which is a luggage cart that\nwill clip onto an escalator.
No one else has copied it.
I find it unbelievable,\nbut that's a fact.
Somehow I suppose the\npatent rights are too heavy.
I don't know.
Well, here you see the parking\ngarage [inaudible] clearly,
I think.
And the existing cover platforms\nthe rail system entering.
And then two years\nlater, they do
this for Perugia, which is\na regional administration
building.
To build a building as\na viaduct, actually.
It's an office building.
But of course with courtyards,\nit's definitely a megaform.
And at the end of the\nmegaform, these parking silos
and the teleferico leads\nyou up to the hill town.
And in a way, this long\nviaduct block creates a--
that's the other\npoint about it--
a kind of order within the chaos\nof interrelated freestanding
objects that surround\nthe foothills of Perugio.
Here we see the idea, which also\nis rated to a major auto route.
This, in this case, built\nthe northern zone, from which
it gets the term "zen."
Zen block by Vittorio Gregotti\nand Franco Perini in Palermo
And here we have\nmegaforms in the term
in the form of\nresidential blocks
that layer, that create a\nnew texture in the landscape
entirely.
You see the blocks here.
They, in fact,\ncreate a new domain.
A landmark, in fact, you\ncould say against the chaos
of the development of Palermo.
And I think it's\none of the finest--
I think it's suffered\nfrom bad maintenance
but I think it's one of\nthe finest housing schemes
that Gregotti Associati\nwould produce.
And Perini, at this date, is\nclosely connected to Gregotti.
And the two of them together\ndesigned this project
for the University of Florence.
But it's the same\nidea, of course.
It's only now it's not housing,\nit's faculty buildings.
And they, of course,\nestablish a new landscape.
And our kind of, in\nmy view, megaforms.
And you see the idea in this\nmodel, I think, rather clearly.
And this will lead\nto this built work.
And here, oh, this\nis something--
I personally think Vittorio\nGregotti is, well, it's
very tragic really.
Because almost all of his\nwriting is only in Italian.
And the very important\nbook he wrote
in 1966 called The\nTerritory of Architecture,
has only been translated, as\nfar as I know, into French.
It certainly doesn't\nexist in English.
And it's really a\ngreat loss, I think.
There, in that book, he,\nGregotti, re-discovers
this German geographer,\nFriedrich Ratzel,
who coins the term\n"anthrogeographic,"
and makes his argument\nthat, in fact,
of course, species being\nhas transformed the surface
of the earth all the time.
And produces a kind of\nanthrogeographic pattern out
of it.
And I think this idea, that,\nof course, leads to the title
The Territory of Architecture.
And it leads to this project\nfor the University of Cosenza.
I think this is like\n6,000 meters long.
Well, what it is,\nin fact, of course,
is a continuous walkway that\nlinks all these lecture halls
and faculty buildings across\nthis valley to a rail link here
and a road link here.
And it cuts across\nthis mountain chain.
So that's a model of it here.
There's the rail link.
This is a road link.
One wonders, it's a long walk.
Of course, it's full of\nthe virile young people,
but maybe, if one had\nmore money perhaps
we introduced a travel\n[? agent. ?] But, in any case,
he got it built finally,\nthis kind of megaform.
And it brings me\nto this work, which
is by Weiss Manfredi for the\nsculpture park in Portland.
Well, what they\nhad to do there is
to deal with an existing road\nsystem and an existing rail
system.
And of course, disused land\nbetween them, absolutely cut
off, ruined.
And of course, the\nremoteness of the water.
So they devised this\nvery ingenious--
it's a megaform but also\nit's a land form, in a way.
And I'm thinking now of a book\npublished by Staten Island
and [? hasham ?] [? sarcass ?]\nwith that title, Landform.
And it is what it was meant\nto be, a sculpture park.
And also allows-- that's\nthe important thing-- allows
the public to enter\nfrom the land side.
And gradually, through\na series of ramps,
come down to have this kind\nof relationship to the water
while still keeping the\nfreight rail underneath
and the auto route\npassing underneath.
That's an urban\nintervention for sure.
We see the ingenuity\ninvolved in order
to create this\nurban intervention.
The fact that one has to create\na kind of artificial ground,
really.
All these sections make it\nquite clear what the game is.
And here you see, well, it's\nthe thing in action, basically.
The auto route, of\ncourse, is emerging here.
The rail is going under here.
And we're coming down.
By this bridge, you go\ndown to the river here.
Seattle.
And this is a work by MMBB, a\nyoung Brazilian team that was
at some point led\nby Angelo Butti,
and in collaboration with\n[? menteta ?] [? russia. ?]
[? menteta ?] [? russia ?]\nprobably should feature much
more strongly in this account\nthan he does because this is
the so-called Dom\nPedro Bus Station.
Unfortunately, I should\nhave images of it.
It is very beautifully\ndesigned in detail.
But here, I think, just even\nan element of this order
has a kind of\nlandscape character,
urban landscape\ncharacter in relation
to the auto route in the center\nof the incredible chaos of Sao
Paolo.
More interestingly, I think,\nis this project of 2008
by [? menteta ?]\n[? russia ?] for Paris,
which was part of the Olympic\nbid by Paris for the 2012
Olympics, which it did not get.
But part of its bid was\nthis sports boulevard,
designed by [? menteta ?]\n[? russia, ?] now acting alone,
with all these stadia and\narenas of different kinds on top
of this podium platform, with\na major arena off to one side,
playing with the existing water,\nwhich is always something which
he, as the son of a\nhydraulic engineer,
was constantly involved with.
But maybe, the\nreal thing is this.
What I find encouraging is--
well, this is the outer\nperiphery, basically.
And this is the chaos that\ninterrelated freestanding
objects ad infinitum\nthat surround
the Haussmannian core of Paris.
And this is the famous canal.
And here, he inserts this thing.
It's an other.
It is a kind of\nlandmark, a intervention,
which gives a point of\nregister in what is otherwise
the totally chaotic\nurbanized region.
I don't know how many\nof you have recently
traveled from the center of\nLondon to London City Airport.
But if one wants to see a total\nand utter irrational nightmare
produced by, what can we say?\nby the market, that's it.
This work has always\nfascinated me.
And of course, again,\nanother program.
In the case of [? menteta ?]\n[? russia, ?] it was a sports
facility.
Or in another instance,\na bus terminal.
Or now, a ferry terminal plus\nactually a brilliant project.
I don't know whether\neither of the two
authors of this project,\nAlexander Zaera-Polo
and Farshid Moussavi,\nwho actually entered
this competition when they were\nboth studying at [inaudible]
They were doing postgraduate\nstudies at the [inaudible],,
I think.
And they won the competition.
And it was built.
And I really wonder whether\nthey will ever again
equal this work, the\nYokohama ferry terminal.
And the amazing thing is\nthat the Japanese built it,
of course.
And it's very interesting.
It was largely built by\nJapanese ship industry, in fact.
Much of it is made\nout of folded plate,
welded folded plate steel.
But it combines.
It is also a hybrid building.
I think that what\nis another aspect
of this kind of fictive\nidea of mine, a megaform,
is that the program can\nsometimes be hybrid.
So in this building, it's\nnot only a ferry terminal
but it's also, again, a\npark, a kind of belvedere,
and a theater.
All these things are synthesized\ninto the same building.
Actually, it reminds me\nof the apocryphal aphorism
of Le Corbusier, which is,\nto design you need talent,
to program you need genius.
And I think, who\ndreamt up this program?
is the question.
One can ask the same thing about\nRobson's Square in Vancouver.
Who dreamt up that program?
Or for that matter, Rockefeller\nCenter, in its original form
was certainly a\ncity in miniature,
from a cultural point of view.
Still is, I think.
And the other thing that I\nthink is also somewhat unique,
since we've all passed\nthrough, maybe still continues,
the morphology moment--
what I'm thinking\nof Zahar, of course.
But I could think of others,\nlike Frank Gehry, of course.
They produced a\nlittle book, which
was very much related to D'Arcy\nThompson's Growth and Form.
They produced a book\nwhere they tried
to create a typology in relation\nto certain building types that
will give them, as it were,\na kind of biological format.
And here, what I think\nis extraordinary,
is the way in which the\nstructure transforms itself.
The welded steel folded plate\nstructure transforms itself
according to the synthetic\ncontent of the program within.
And we see it here.
Of course, computer\naided design, how else
could they have done this?
It is breathtaking,\nthis wooden deck
and what they do with\nthis wooden deck.
And of course, this\nsomewhat sparse green roof.
Maybe it's more of a\nbelvedere than it is a park.
But nevertheless, it's\nstill a great pleasure.
Here you get the full weight\nof the Japanese ingeniousness
is right here with this\nfolded plate construction.
I remember going to an\nexhibition of this building
before it was built in the\nInstitute of Contemporary
Arts in London.
And part of the\nexhibition, there
was a huge pile of drawings\nabout this high bound
with raffia, very elegantly\nbound with raffia.
And each section in\na brown paper cover.
And this was the\nworking drawings
that the Japanese had produced.
Because once they'd received the\nexecutive drawings from the--
which also happened in the\ncase of Rafael Vinoly's--
which is also a\nmegaform, by the way--
Tokyo [inaudible]\nthe Odyssey building
in the center of Tokyo.
Exactly the same thing.
The Japanese took\nthe information
and then redrew the\nwhole thing the way
they wanted to build it.
Of course, Stephen Hall's hybrid\nbuilding, now acknowledging
its character, built-- that's\nthe astonishing thing--
and built by private developers.
This is hard to believe.
Who would actually\nsink geothermal wells
in the ground 100 feet?
I can't imagine-- where\nis the American developer
is going to do that, I wonder?
And it houses 7,000 people\nin 2,500 apartments, I think.
The flat [inaudible]\nfamous flying bridges
contain exercise rooms and\nother kinds of amenities.
And something of\nthe same, of course,
is also the Vanke so-called\nhorizontal skyscraper
that he built in Chengdu.
No, Shenzhen, rather.
And which looks back to\nthe mountains on one side
and looks out to\nsea on the other.
And looks like this.
Has this idea of\nproviding shaded space.
I don't find this\nmegaform as convincing
as the hybrid building.
I want to end with a work\nby Fumihiko Maki, which
is this polytechnic made outside\nof Singapore in an area called
Woodland, which consists of--
it's called the Republic\nPolytechnic, I think--
it consists of a disk, a green\ndisk, which is elevated--
an earthwork, in fact,\nelevated above the--
it's a kind of\nartificial ground.
And on this artificial ground\nare these 11-story teaching
blocks.
There's a major\nassembly hall here,
which is also accessible to\nthe public, and administration,
and so on, and\nparking, and staff
residential facilities\nhere, gymnasium.
But the building, this shows\nyou how it is developed.
These are the faculty\nbuildings, in fact,
with specialized faculty here.
Gymnasium, residences, main\nadministration building.
And this is the upper plan\nshowing the greensward
and the way these classrooms,\nthey're little teaching towers,
in fact, that are\nabove this disk.
And so this section shows\nyou the disk like this,
which has its own incline.
And this colored area here is\nall the public space underneath
but lit from above.
So the public space\nis here in yellow.
The space of public\nappearance, if you like.
With here a pool.
Now there are different\ncourtyards that are let down
and give light, of\ncourse, and air.
The little green\nthings are all courts
let into the disk on top.
So this is the\ngreen disk on top.
Staff residents in the rear.
And this is the upper\nlevel looking down
into the courtyards.
This is the courtyard itself\npartly with an ornamental pool,
partly planked in wood.
Or the view from the\nlibrary onto the courtyard.
And the dining hall with\na large window opening
to the courtyard.
And, I think, a\ngymnasium beneath.
Which brings me to\nthe end, as you'll
be happy to hear perhaps.
I want to say, well, this\nwhole idea of megaform
as urban landscape begins\nwith this building, in fact.
Which is in, I think,\n1990, early 1990
by Rafael Moneo and the\nlate Manuel de Sola-Morales.
Very prominent Catalan urbanist.
I think there are\ntwo main figures.
One is Busquets,\nwho teaches here.
And Manuel de Sola-Morales,\nwho is no longer alive,
unfortunately.
And actually, Manuel published\nan amazing magazine called
[? oure. ?] He is also\none of the, in some ways,
innovators of landscape\nurbanism, I think.
Maybe it's more\nimportant to associate
his theoretical approach\nwith acupuncture.
I love this idea.
Urban acupuncture.
With the notion that\nstrategically placed
intervention can have\na catalytic effect
upon the surroundings,\napart from asserting itself
as a world in itself, as a\nkind of world in miniature.
And this block on the\nAvenida Diagonal, shown here,
is this famous Ila block.
And actually, in this\nvery room, I think,
I meant Raffa Monea with a tiny\nlittle model of this block.
Where the character of the block\ndepends on its serrated top.
The character of the block\nis a landmark, that is.
And then the other thing that\nintrigues me is that, in a way,
it is open to reuse because\ninstead curtain wall
you have pierced windows.
So you could, in fact, turn\nwhat is an office building
into an apartment\nbuilding, I think,
without too much difficulty.
Unlike many curtain\nwall monsters,
which will not allow\nthemselves too easily
be transformed in this way.
But the other interesting\nthing, and it's very hard
to see in this rather\nbad image, there
is an existing shopping frontage\nhere on the Avenida Diagonal.
And inside this building--
this shows you the--\nit's very schematic,
but this shows you the outer\nlimits of the [inaudible]
of the 19th century.
And the ease with\nwhich one can get
either on foot or by public\ntransport to this building.
It doesn't really show\nyou the shopping frontage
of the Avenida Diagonal.
But that it is certainly there.
This is this shopping frontage\nof the Avenida Diagonal.
And inside there is\nthis shopping mall.
And underneath, very important,\nis this enormous provision
of parking so that\npeople can drive
into this center, this point\nof urban acupuncture, and park
and take elevators up and\nshop in the shopping mall--
this is the shopping mall--
also in the Avenida Diagonal.
What impresses me\nabout this, you
could say, all these\nAmerican provincial towns
where the suburban shopping\ncenter is built outside.
And of course, the Main\nStreet is totally destroyed.
That's what's happened in\ncountless American provincial
cities surrounded by suburbs.
And not only American\nprovincial cities.
It's also happened in the UK.
This same unfortunate\nphenomenon.
So it's also a programmed thing.
It's not only the form,\nand the form is important--
this is my point about the\nlandscape, the landmark,
I mean.
The chaos of-- this is a\nbull ring in Barcelona--
but the chaos of\nthe surrounding--
Norman Foster-- chaos of\nthe surrounding suburbs
are right there.
And I think that's the\nlast image, isn't it?
No, not quite.
This is in Agadir.
It's by Vittorio Gregotti.
I could, of course, show\nRenzo Piano's San Nicola
Stadium in Bari.
This is a more recent\nwork in Agadir.
It surely is a megaform.
Parking is arranged\nvery similar, actually,
to Renzo Piano's\nSan Nicola Stadium.
But the entrances are\na bit more cryptic.
The whole thing is\ndecidedly more monumental.
Again, we come back to a sports\nfacility as stadium, and so on.
I think, probably, I've\nalmost come to the end.
But not quite.
I haven't given this\nlecture very often.
In fact, I think this is the\nsecond time I've given it.
I gave it in the\nUniversity of Illinois,
Champaign Urbana when I was\ninvited to be the [? plim ?]
professor there.
But one of the deals is that\nevery [? plim ?] professor
has to give a lecture, and it\nhas to be made into a book.
So I have, in fact.
I've already published\nthe damn book.
But it's a bit thin as\nthis lecture is a bit thin.
And so what?
There's always the\nembarrassing thing.
Why don't I read this.
"Since 1960, when the French\ngeographer Jean Gottmann first
coined the term "megalopolis,"\nautomotive regional
urbanization has become the\nuniversal land settlement
pattern of late capitalism.
Stimulated by the mass ownership\nof the automobile, megalopoli
coming into being\nall over the world
today, accommodating\npopulations around 20 million
apiece in the developing\nworld, and five million
or so in many North\nAmerican conurbations.
With regard to this\nlast, we may note
that some three million\nacres of agricultural land
are lost each year in the\nUS through suburbanization,
with little or no provision\nfor public transport.
That reminds me of Wendell\nBerry's Unsettling of America,
where he points out\nthat agrobusiness--
what a term that is--
cheap food with the combination\nof artificial fertilizers,
and genetic modifications,\nand pesticides
is gradually losing the\ntopsoil of the United States
into the rivers and\nout of the sea."
This is book argument made\nby Wendell Berry already
in the mid-'60s.
"The net effect is\nthe proliferation
of the non-place urban realm\nas celebrated by Melvin
Weber in his book Explorations\nand Urban Structures in 1963.
It's interesting that Melvin\nWeber was in the backroom
of the [inaudible]\nWeeks and Bore--
Martin Bore being the planner--
when they designed Milton\nKeynes inaugurated in 1972,
the last British new town."
And I suppose,\naround the same time,
Reston is the last pathetic\nattempt in the States
to do a new town.
"There was, in fact,\na decade before,
a new town projected for\nHampshire amazing town
of Hook," which was very\nbeautifully-- it wouldn\'t
pass muster with Jose Luis\nSert's idea of urban design,
I think.
But that was not\nbuilt. What was built
instead Milton Keynes, which\nwas like an instant Los Angeles,
suburbanized, in the end,\nsuperimposed, distorted
one kilometer grid over the\nprevious undulating agrarian
land of Buckinghamshire.
My second point is, "under these\ncircumstances, the stratagem
of the time-honored master\nplan as an instrument
of urban design would\nseem to be untenable,
particularly given the\nrelatively limited resources
available for public\nintervention at a civic scale,
along with the volatile\nrate of spontaneous growth
and change in most urban areas."
In other words, master plans\nare already out of date
as soon as they are--
other than in the case\nof infrastructures.
But even then, I think.
"Third point is, the\nde facto emergence
of megalopolitan patents\nof land settlement
present us with two\nalternative strategies,
as far as future\ndevelopment is concerned.
A, the current ad\nhoc proliferation
that there are related\nrelatively isolated
freestanding objects.
Or B, place creating counter\ntheses of megaform integrated
into a site as a\ndiscontinuous exception
to the otherwise\nundifferentiated, hated
urban cacophony."
It should be clear from\nthe"-- this is point four--
"from the wide range of\nmegaform cited in the foregoing,
that a megaform may come into\nbeing at quite different scales
and thereby assume distinctly\ndifferent place creating
potential, depending not\nonly on the scale but also
on the programmatic complexities\nof form in each instance."
Even, of course, low\nrise, high density,
now no longer fashionable\nwent towards a kind
of megaform transformation\nof the environment.
The fifth point is, megaform\ncan also be landscape itself,
as in the case of an Enrique\n[? mariason ?] [inaudible]
[? binos ?] in [inaudible]\ncemetery in Barcelona of 1992.
Or the Olympic Park, Seattle,\n2000 by Manfredi and Weiss.
Six was definition.
"By definition, a megaform\nis restricted in its extent,
and it may thus be realized by\nthe society in a limited time
period."
I think that's important\nbecause otherwise, of course,
nothing gets done.
Seventh point is, I\nsuppose, I made a comparison
to the 19th century arcade.
"The megaform has the capacity\nof providing a public domain."
Ah, this is it.
"The space the public\nappearance in what
is otherwise totally\nprivatized processal
commodified environment."
Eight.
"Within the space endlessness of\nthe megalopolis, characterized
by Marc Auge," in a wonderful\nbook called [french],,
Non Place, a megaform may\nalso serve as a landmark,
should, I think,\nmust serve, in a way,
as a landmark, such as Poelzig\'s\nHouse of Friendship, 1917."
Nine.
"It would seem that certain\ncontemporary building programs
lend themselves to this idea.
Of course, hospitals,\nuniversities,
maybe air terminals,\nrailway stations,
shopping centers, cemeteries,\nsports facilities,
convention centers."
And 10.
Well, you it just\nsays, "The world
megaforms primary thought\nof as interventions
in the megalopolis.
Clearly, Rockefeller\nCenter being an example,
can also be applied\nto a historic fabric."
Thanks.
[applause]
[inaudible] for a\nlittle discussion?
Yeah, sure, of course.
Of course, yes, of course.
So Kenneth has agreed\nto take some discussion.
Maybe I could just almost\nstart with your 10 points
and thinking about\nthe public issue.
Because one of the\nthings, you know
that in Boston Amazon\nis looking for a place
to build Amazon 2, a giant--
does anyone know the numbers?
I can't remember.
Amazon is proposing to\nbuild either near Boston
in the peri-urban area or\neven further out in some
of the suburbs this\ngiant, new headquarters.
You mentioned, of\ncourse, that most
of the projects that you list in\nthe programmatic way or either
infrastructural or giant\npublic gatherings like stadia,
or terminals, or things like\nthat, which in the States
right now aren't getting built.
But what will get built, at\nleast in the near future,
it seems, are these major\nprivate corporations, but not
even Rockefeller Center, of a\nscale that's even much bigger.
In your examples, do\nyou recall, is there
a way we could hope\nfor something other
than a purely\nexclusive megaform that
might result from something\nlike the Amazon project,
in so far as everybody in that\ncomplex would both be working
for Amazon and,\nI suppose, they'd
also be living in kind\nof a town near Amazon,
which means they're all more\nor less the same bandwidth
of economics--
of income, and things like that?
Is there any is there any\nhope of a more diverse--
could the sheer\nsize of these things
also encourage a diversity\nof public in terms of income,
or other vocation,\nor other ways?
Is there any\nindication for that?
Like Yokohama, obviously,\neverybody, in a way,
has to go through there\nbecause it's an exchange point.
But in something like Amazon,\nthe private developers,
seems to me, the danger\nis a kind of exclusivity.
I have one comment.
I was thinking about Amazon\nas I put this together.
Of course, I've thought\nabout it before.
Well, if you think that\nthe thing that set me off
was Ila block in\nBarcelona, there's
also a hotel, schools,\nmainly offices,
and this shopping\nmall, which keeps
alive the traditional shopping\nfrontage of the avenida.
Which could have be done,\nof course, on a small scale
in many other places.
But it is interesting.
I was thinking about Amazon and\nI've thought a lot about Amazon
recently.
The aim, of course, is to get\nrid of shopping altogether.
So that the pseudo\npublic realm of shopping
will be eliminated\nbecause everything
will be delivered by--
that's the project, basically.
That's the project.
And the warehouses\nin which this stuff
is put together for shipment\nare certainly not public at all.
They're just, in a way,\nthey're kind of sweatshops.
Yeah, well, that's a\npretty black picture.
I totally concede, it's\na totally black picture.
But it's interesting how,\nin effect, at the end
I cite the Ila\nblock in Barcelona.
But Ila block in Barcelona, if\nAmazon is given its full scope,
will be destroyed, of course.
Its function went up [inaudible]
I don't know if the sheer size--
as soon as you start saying, OK,\nthey're going to need a hotel,
they have to have family visit.
It's [inaudible] interesting\nthat Amazon bought Whole Foods.
So they are aware of\na food industry that's
not the one you described.
It's a different\nkind of agribusiness.
It's still agribusiness but\nit's certainly different.
But maybe the sheer\nsize means that there
have to be other functions in\nadjacencies that would bring
in different classes,\ndifferent colors, different,
I don't know.
But you need someone\nwith a brain,
like Olivetti, Adrianos\nOlivetti Communitas.
The whole project\nof Andria Olivetti
before the Second World War\nand immediately after in
[? avria. ?] That was\na San Simonean idea.
There's no indication that\n[? besart ?] has a San Simonean
bone in his body.
Italian industrialists,\nyou could
say that Olivetti\nwas anachronistic.
It's not an accident that we're\ncomparing him to San Simone.
He's almost like a 19th\ncentury figure that ends up
in the 20th century creating\nthis magazine, Communitas,
the wholly [inaudible]\nof business.
And therefore, a\ntotal community.
it's a concept of a--
But I don't see [? besart ?]\ngetting around to that, do you?
Take this opportunity to\nask him questions, comments.
Layne.
[inaudible]
Thank you.
I would like to put in\ncomparison the idea of megaform
with another idea, which\nis popular in the school,
about the archipelago, which\ncertainly has a long history
but has been most recently\nelaborated by [inaudible] If we
understand the megaform as being\ncritical because of its scale
and its singularity against\nthe logic of urbanization
in order to make place\nand give potential
for landscape, that sort of\nthing, it's at the same time,
also a product of neoliberal\naccumulation at a vast scale.
So I wonder how this idea\nof the archipelago, which
seems to me like\nirreconcilable with the scale
nature of megaform,\nthe archipelago
tries to or is seen as, because\nof its fragmented nature,
establish an agonistic\nlife in the city.
But I wonder what you think\nabout the fragmentary, small
scale potential\nof the archipelago
to resist urbanization as\nsomething which obviously has
to operate in a very different\nway from the large scale
of the megaform.
Yeah.
That's a very good question.
I think that the\nquestion is, how do you
activate the\npolitical constitution
of these fragmentary\nparts of an archipelago?
I am someone who\nis very admiring
of Spanish architecture\nafter the demise of Franco.
And I think the quality\nof this architecture
dependent upon the vitality\nof the Spanish city-state,
both as a political\nand cultural entity.
know
They didn't going into\nbuilding megaforms too much.
Well, they built a\nfew stadia, but if I
understood what you implied\nby the term archipelago.
I think that if you\ncan't constitute
the space of appearance\nyou can't really
develop a culture that has\nreal political strength
and identity, I don't think.
In some ways, critical\nregionalism was about that,
I think.
Anyway, the way the kind\nof twist that, if you like.
Or the way in which I adapted\nit from the [? sonas ?]
[? lefrebre ?] original\nformulation of the term
"critical regionalism."
One of the things which\nis always left out, not
by Friedrich\nJameson, by the way,
who wrote a critique of it,\nactually, a brilliant critique,
is the cultural,\npolitical implications.
He wrote a critique from a\nvery hard Marxist standpoint,
which threw doubt on the\ncultural, political viability
of such entities.
And that's really\nwhy I introduced
the idea of city-state,\nwhich, of course,
we don't have city-states.
And it is interesting that\nMargaret Thatcher, neoliberal,
coming to power in UK, would\ndestroy the physical power also
of British provincial cities\nto concentrate all the power
in London and to\nweaken them as any kind
of political opposition\nor cultural and political
independence.
Attempts have been\nmade to repair that.
But that was the game clearly.
Someone else?
Could we get it right\nhere in the middle?
Thank you for your talk.
My question is rather simple.
I'm curious if you\nhave anything to say
about accidental megastructures\nversus these structures that
have plenty of authorship\nand thought embedded in them?
Can you give me an example?
For example, Kowloon\nWalled City in China.
Or perhaps one could consider\nurban sprawl happening
in underprivileged areas as\nmegastructural accumulations,
or neighborhoods where\nthe authorship doesn't
seem to have a direct source.
There's still the same type\nof social coherency existing
inside them.
Well, maybe that, of\ncourse, for me anyway,
at this moment,\nclearer formulation
of the idea of archipelago.
But of course, you don't really\nneed architects for that,
in fact.
It's interesting that\nRudofsky's Architecture
Without Architects, is 1964.
Happens to be very close to the\ndate of Chermayeff Alexander's
Community and Privacy.
This kind of vernacular was\nin the way [? bariatta ?]
[? favela, ?]\nspontaneous housing,
is a kind of vernacular\ndoesn't need architects at all.
People build their\nown environments.
So fashion has no--
what do architects do?
John Turner's book\nmakes it clear
that architects should\nonly be involved
in adding or somehow\nadministering
the provision of sewerage or\nelectrical power or something.
But part of that,\nI mean, forget it.
The people know you can't\nintervene, really, basically.
And authorship's a funny word\nbecause something of that size
is going to be a\nhuge collaboration
of different dimensions of\narchitecture, engineering,
different kinds of planning.
Gregotti is an author in\nthe sense you're using it.
But Amazon, it's not\nclear yet if they're
going to use architects.
They have their own designers.
And it won't be\nauthored in that sense.
Because-- a continuation\non that question
on this concept of authorship.
Whether it's a state\nor a private entity,
like Amazon, there's\na certain organization
within that structure\nthat's required to initiate
a project of a megaform.
So I think that that could be\na whole other lecture maybe
about what are the organizations\nrequired to execute
those types of projects?
Can I just say something\nabout what the--
I don't know exactly what\nthe archipelago idea is.
But the one thing I would ask\nthe two of you to comment on,
or the students, is the\nquestion of disconnect.
Because I think what\nKen was talking about,
in fact, is about connection.
It's about taking\nfragmentation and connecting it
to something that's more\nembedded, let's say, in a city
in the different\ndimensions of a city.
When you have these structures\nthat are built, not by design,
they are often\nquite disconnected.
So I don't know if we should be\nglorifying that disconnection,
or maybe we're overly\nglorifying the connection.
I think, in a way, they are\nconnected because people,
at that level of survival,\ndepend on each other
and build their houses like\nalmost on top of each other,
I think.
[inaudible]
There's a question in\nhere, and then Ben next.
Sorry.
It was kind of related.
Going off of this sort of\nconnection and disconnection.
If we're talking about\nmegaform as a landscape,
as something that\ncan begin to connect
all these diverse\nentities, how can we
begin to think of\nmegaform as a kind
of perceptual or\nincremental construction
rather than this huge,\nlarge scale capitalist
entity, something carried\nout by such a huge entity.
Or if it's not carried out by\nthis capitalist entity does it
not necessarily make\nit a megaform anymore?
The whole thing is, what can you\ndo under capitalism, basically?
Because I'm someone who\nthinks as someone said,
it's easier to imagine\nthe end of the world
than to imagine the\nend of capitalism.
you Architecture is a bourgeois\nprofession, in the end.
It is.
The profession is at the\nservice of capitalism
because we don't live\nin a socialist society.
I am interested in this kind\nof large scale intervention
as providing some\nindicator of a place,
both in terms of its\nlandmark qualities
but also in terms of the\nkind of space of appearance
that it provides inside it.
And at different scales.
As a compensation for a\nplacelessness and no space
of appearance, basically.
A privatized, commoditized\nsociety under capitalism.
I think it is like that.
Ben, maybe, has the last one.
Well, this is totally related\nto [inaudible] This is related
to the last couple questions.
And it's just a\ncomment, basically.
I think the most powerful\nnotion that you put forward
is that precisely all of\nthese architectural projects
operate as totally discontinuous\nfrom the urban fabric.
How something which\nasserts itself
as a autonomous\nfigural iconic object
is in fact perhaps the\nmost urbanistically
instrumentalization\nat that scale.
I think one of the earliest\nideas of an urban project
was to unify Rome\nwith these obelisks.
And they are in\nfact not immediately
productive in terms\nof the spatial scale
that we normally consider\nin terms of architecture.
But they're extremely\nproductive as this sort
of processional experience\nthrough the city.
And that relates back\nto your original comment
about freeways being completely\nuseless without signs.
That's just a comment.
No, I think you got it.
I think that's the case.
The idea is this.
The idea of intervention.
Intervention is a\nkind of compensation
for what is otherwise absent.
The placelessness impact.
Of course, I know\nwithin the placelessness
you can find little corners\nhere and there which have
a kind of unique character.
But the general drive in terms\nof these 20 million cities
that I cited, is a production\nwhich is indifferent, really,
to any idea of the urban.
And your comment about\nobelisk made me think of--
Argan, wrote a little book\ncalled The Renaissance City.
And he begins the book by saying\nwe can't say the Renaissance
city never existed.
What existed was a medieval\ncity into which were inserted
Renaissance monumental pieces.
He gives Florence as a classic\nexample of this, Brunelleschi,
et cetera, et cetera.
I suppose that notion, we\ncan't say that the Renaissance
city didn't exist.
It relates for me to\nMies' comment, that's
why we can't do cities anymore.
We can't do planned cities,\net cetera, et cetera.
It goes on like a forest.
But we can do the monuments.
We can do the obelisks.
Yes, you can do interventions.
The question is, what\nis the intervention?
To borrow Manuel de\nSolar-Morales' metaphor,
what kind of urban acupuncture,\nwhat kind of project
can one imagine and also\nlaunch somehow or other
in a society like this?
It's of course problematic.
I know it's problematic.
But the lecture has this\nparticular character
because I am somehow preoccupied\nwith this question of where
is the public realm?
How does any kind of public\nrealm come into being?
Just one quick thing.
I was thinking about\nthese last few questions.
The thing you\nemphasized that might
go some way of answering the\nincremental question as well
as the archipelago question.
The dominance of\nthe ground plane
and the need for a\ncontinuous ground plane,
even if the buildings are\naggregates, the ground plane
itself somehow needs\nto be continuous for
a proper megaform to emerge.
And I think there's beginning\nof some kind of answer.
It's also going back to\nthe landscape urbanism
relationship.
That that provides a continuity\neven when the buildings
aren't continuous.
That seemed to be important.
One last comment, which\nis that the Golden Lanes
I showed at the beginning,\nthe street in the air
is obviously a huge problem\nbecause it's not a street.
It's totally\ndisconnected already
from any kind of\ncontinuous fabric.
So I heard the rudiments of\nat least six thesis projects
there.
One of the great things\nabout Kenneth's work,
again, is inspiring\nin very different ways
either to go against and\nrefute it or to learn from it.
So that was so valuable for us.
And thank you very\nmuch for coming.
[inaudible] Thank you.
