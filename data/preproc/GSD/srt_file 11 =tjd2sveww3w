I'm Chris Herbert.
I'm the managing director\nof the Joint Center
for Housing Studies.
And on behalf of\nthe Joint Center,
it's my privilege to welcome\ndistinguished faculty
and guests, students, and the\nbroader Cambridge community
to the 18th John\nT. Dunlop lecture.
Each year, the Dunlop\nlecture provides us
with an opportunity\nto recall and pay
tribute to Professor Dunlop\nfor his many important
contributions to the worlds of\nacademia, policy, and industry.
John was a remarkable\nman, marked
by a tremendous intellect,\na shrewd vision,
unflagging energy, and an\nimpatience to get things done,
which I experienced a\nbit as a grad student
watching him deal with Jim\nBrown of the Joint Center.
He applied these skills in a\nlong and distinguished career
over the span of many decades as\na scholar, a dean, a mediator,
a labor secretary,\nand an advisor
to presidents of both\nthe US and of Harvard.
But among his many\naccomplishments,
Professor Dunlop was\nalso instrumental
in providing support and\nguidance for the Joint Center
from its founding in\n1959 through the end
of his life in 2003.
Professor Dunlop\nrecognized the importance
of having a center at Harvard\nthat keeps a consistent focus
on housing, given\nthe fundamental role
that decent, affordable\nhomes play as a foundation
for the well-being of\nfamilies and individuals,
as a critical element of\nhealthy and vital communities,
and as an engine\nof economic growth.
It's not an exaggeration to say\nthat without Professor Dunlop's
unwavering vision and\npersistent efforts on behalf
of the center, we probably\nwouldn't be here today.
And so this lecture is a\nsmall but important way
of marking our gratitude\nfor all that he
did to help the center pursue\nour mission of advancing
the understanding of\nhousing and forming policy
and training the next\ngeneration of housing leaders.
Over its history,\nthe Dunlop lecture
has featured a variety\nof perspectives
on critical housing\nissues, offering
a platform for distinguished\nleaders from academia,
from homebuilding, from finance,\nfrom advocacy, and policy.
And looking over the\nlist of past lectures
provides a portrait\nof the housing issues
that have been most\nsalient since the start
of this century, when\nthe lecture series began.
And while the housing\nchallenges facing
the country are\nunfortunately numerous,
in planning this year's\nlecture, the choice
of theme to\nhighlight was obvious
given the timing of\nthe lecture, which
coincides with the anniversary\nof the enactment of the Fair
Housing Act, signed into law\nexactly 50 years ago tomorrow
by President Lyndon Johnson\non April 11, 1968, one
week after Martin Luther King\nJr. was killed in Memphis.
Over the last\nhalf-century, there's
been some progress\nin breaking down
barriers to more integrated\ncommunities, as evidenced
by what could be described as\nmodest declines in segregation
across much of the country.
But nonetheless, racial\nand ethnic segregation
remains quite high,\nparticularly in urban areas
in the Northeast and Midwest.
And importantly,\nsegregation is associated
with a significant\nconcentration of poor minorities
in areas of\nconcentrated poverty.
A growing body of\nsocial science research
has found that these patterns\nhave significant repercussions
for the well-being\nand life chances
of those who live in\nthese communities.
In addition, there's\ngood evidence
that a lack of\ninteraction between
racial and ethnic\ngroups contributes
to prejudice and mistrust.
In short, segregation\nmatters for individuals
affected by this and\nfor the broader society.
However, the forces\nproducing segregation
by race and ethnicity and income\nare arguably different today
than they were 50 years ago.
As studies by HUD have\nfound, overt discrimination
is much less evident.
But the historical legacy\nof past discrimination
lives on in today's\nresidential patterns,
in economic inequality,\nand how choices
are made about where to live.
As a result, if we're to\nhave meaningful improvement
in reducing segregation,\nit'll take more
than simply removing\ndiscriminatory barriers.
It will require\naffirmative steps
to promote integration, which is\nsomething the Fair Housing Act
itself recognized when\nenacted 50 years ago.
So as we considered\nwho to invite
to reflect on the past,\nthe present, and the future
of fair housing, our\nthoughts turned immediately
to Raphael Bostic, president\nof the Federal Reserve
Bank of Atlanta.
Raphael's an obvious choice\nto deliver the Dunlop lecture
in part because his own career\nmirrors Professor Dunlop's
distinguished contributions to\nthe worlds of academia, policy,
and practice.
Until his appointment last year\nas president of the Atlanta
Fed, Raphael was Judith\nand John Bedrosian Chair
in Governance and\nPublic Enterprise
at the Sol Price School of\nPublic Policy at the University
of Southern California.
He's also a Harvard\nundergrad, so we probably
like to take credit\nfor everything
he's done since then.
Through his academic\ncareer, his research
has spanned many fields,\nincluding homeownership,
housing finance, neighborhood\nchange, and the roles
of institutions in shaping\npolicy effectiveness,
all of which have\nstrong connections
to the questions related to\nfair housing and integration.
He also served as Assistant\nSecretary to Policy Development
and Research at HUD\nunder Shaun Donovan,
who we're very pleased to have\nwith us here tonight, as well,
an old friend and a\nJoint Center alum.
And importantly, while serving\nas assistant secretary,
Raphael played a key role\nin developing regulations
for communities receiving HUD\nfunding regarding steps needed
to make good on the Fair\nHousing Act's mandate
to firmly further fair housing.
And in his leadership role\nnow at the Atlanta Fed,
which includes serving on the\nFederal Open Market Committee,
he now wields\nsignificant influence
over the direction of\nfederal financial policy
and how it can serve all\nthe nation's communities.
And for those of us who\nknow him and his work,
we're grateful to have\nsomeone of his intellect,
his perspective, and his\njudgment in that role.
There's no doubt that\nProfessor Dunlop would
have been tremendously\ngratified to have President
Bostic delivering\ntoday's lecture
to help remember his\nlegacy and to speak to such
an important policy issue.
So it's with great honor and\npleasure I introduce to you
Raphael Bostic to deliver\nthis year's lecture.
[applause]
Thank you, Chris, for a\nvery kind introduction.
Good evening, everyone.
Good evening.
So this is one thing I do now.
I'm in the South, so\nwe try to be friendly.
So good evening, everyone.
Good evening.
It's good to be here.
I want to thank the\nJoint Center for inviting
me to speak here tonight.
This is quite an honor to get\noffered to give this lecture.
On the back of the\nprogram, there's
a list of previous speakers,\nand it's quite a list.
Jonathan Reckford,\nhe's on my board
right now at the bank,\na definite leader.
Jonathan Rose, I serve with\nhim on a board at Enterprise
Community Partners.
And he's an innovator in the\nfield of affordable housing.
My former boss, Shaun, is here.
So to have my name on this\nlist is really quite an honor.
It's also very nice to be--
so this is also another\nway for me to feel at home.
Technology always seems to mess\nup when I'm standing behind it.
So we'll just keep going.
This is also very nice\nto be back on campus.
I've always had a warm spot\nin my heart for Harvard.
It's a place that gave me access\nto a life and a trajectory
I wouldn't have had otherwise.
And so it's always good to come\nback, support the institution,
and do all that I can\nto really make sure
that this place continues\nto be a leader in thought
and in policy around\nthe things that
are important for our society.
We should try to move\nthis lecture to June.
So I've lived in\nLA for a long time.
And then going to\nAtlanta, this is
kind of a shock to the system,\nthe drizzle and the gray.
But--
You know Harvard's closed.
Huh?
You know Harvard's closed.
Yeah, we're going to open it up.
You have pull here,\nso make it happen.
And then there's some irony\nto me giving this talk
on this topic, in\nthe sense that there
are many people in\nthis room who have
worked on this subject\nfor a very long time.
And so for me to be\ngiving this talk,
I feel like I should\nbe in the audience
and learning from others.
But I will do my best,\nand we'll see how it goes.
So tonight, my topic\nis fair housing.
It's something that I have\nworked on for a while.
And most notably,\nin recent years,
I spent a fair amount\nof time working
on the reform of the\nAffirmatively Furthering Fair
Housing rule.
I'm going to talk a bit more\nabout that in a little bit.
But I've also been involved\nin some of the enforcement
activities, as well.
So Fair Housing Act\nstarted in 1968.
It really was an outgrowth of\na lot of civil rights energy
and activity.
And it's not an accident\nthat it passed on April 11.
This was a direct response\nto the assassination
of Martin Luther King,\nJr. And that impetus
was actually quite\nimportant, getting us
over the finish line.
Now, it was necessary because\nmarkets were not working,
and free markets\nwere not working
for a large number of people.
And the act really charged\nHUD, the new Department
of Housing and\nUrban Development,
with taking a\nleading role to try
to get markets to work a\nlittle better, get housing
to be more accessible\nand more easily attained
for the full range of\nthe American public.
It charged HUD with\ndoing two things.
First was affirmatively\nfurthering fair housing,
and the second was\neliminating discrimination
by enforcing\nanti-discrimination laws.
And it's an interesting and\nimportant juxtaposition.
One was the enforcement.
We were trying to\nstop activities
from happening that\nwere preventing people
to have access.
But the other was actually\nto be affirmative,
to be positive in the\nspace and to take actions
to make sure and ensure\nthat every American had
true access to\nsafe, high-quality,
and affordable housing.
And so today, what\nI want to do is
spend a fair amount\nof time talking
about how we've done\nin both those spaces,
how have we done where\nenforcement is concerned,
and then what's happening\non the affirmative side.
And I do think that\nit's important for me--
Shawn asked me to do this\naffirmatively furthering thing,
and I didn't really understand\nwhat I was getting into.
It was quite a wrestling\nmatch inside the building
because affirmatively\nacting is inherently
a non-compliant activity.
You're trying to get\npeople to do things
because they want to do it.
If you drag people into things\nand you force them to do it,
which is an enforcement\nmindset, they're
going to ultimately\nwant to do less.
They want to engage\nless, and you're
going to make less progress.
So this second\npiece is something
that is quite important as we\nthink about making progress
in basically all of our\ndiscrimination and equal access
issues.
All right.
So I'm going to talk hopefully\nnot too long tonight.
But I'm going to\nuse as a foundation
a number of things that\ncame out of an article
that I coauthored\nwith Arthur Acolin.
He was a grad student\nof mine at University
of Southern California.
We got asked by the\nJoint Center here
to write a book chapter on\naffirmatively furthering
fair housing.
And so I'm going to use that as\na frame for a lot of what I'm
going to talk about tonight.
Now, when we wrote\nthe chapter, it
was really before the election.
And so a lot has\nhappened since then.
And it's really allowed\nme to be able to step back
and say, OK, there were a\nbunch of things in there
that I thought we\nneeded to pay attention
to when we're thinking about\nwhat success would look like
and whether we would\nachieve success
in the context of affirmatively\nfurthering fair housing.
But now we're in a\nreally different place.
And the pathways that might have\nseemed reasonable or even easy
now seem quite challenging.
And so I want us to\nthink moving forward
about what does that mean for us\nand how should we move forward.
All right.
So that's the title.
I think I was supposed\nto flip to that,
but you had a nicer\ntitle than I did.
So this is actually an\ninteresting day today
because I actually\nmade the slides.
And I'm kind of out of\npractice with that now.
I have staff that does that.
They do a great job.
So this is decidedly\nlow-tech, I'm
going to tell you right\nnow, no movies, no nothing.
There are going to be a lot\nof words and a couple tables,
and we'll kind of\nmove through that.
But what I wanted to do is\njust start with the close
and really give an overview\nof how I see things right now.
Clearly, I just talked about\nwhat the Fair Housing Act is,
and it has these two components.
In terms of enforcement,\nwhat we've seen
is enforcement has been\nconsistently applied
through the life of\nthe Fair Housing Act.
And some of that has\nhappened by the government,
and some of that has\nhappened to the government
by community groups and\nothers who really challenge
the government in saying that\nyou're not taking enforcement
seriously.
You need to do better.
I think that I was hopeful\nwhen I left HUD, actually,
and after working on the\nAffirmatively Furthering
program that we'd see a\nbalance between the attention
to enforcement and the\nattention to being affirmative.
And I think that we may\nnot be in that space.
So enforcement over\nthe next few years
may be the key avenue\nand the key channel
by which we're going to see\nprogress in fair housing.
And that's something\nthat is disappointing,
but it may be where we are.
And then I feel like\nthe reform that we
did in terms of affirmatively\nfurthering fair housing was
actually quite promising.
It was intellectually creative.
It did a lot to try\nto build some buy-in
and democratize the\nparticipation in the planning
processes.
And people felt like\nthey could understand it.
We did a lot of work in the\nfield talking to people,
and governments were like, I\nget this, and this is possible.
But now, I think that\nthere are real questions
as to how much of\nthis we're actually
going to see in\nplace moving forward
and how broadly should we expect\nto see the new regulations
implemented.
Now, on balance, I'm\ntrying to be optimistic.
So I know at these\ntalks, if everyone
left with a cloud, that\nwouldn't be so good.
So I really want people\nto leave thinking
that there is a lot of\npositive that is possible
and that we should expect to\nsee in the next few years.
And in part, it's\nbecause I think
that one of the things\nthat we worked towards very
significantly is trying to\nbroaden the notion of what
fair housing is.
And with that\nbroadening, I think
it increases the\nlikelihood that there
are new allies in the\nfair housing pursuit
and that the coalition\nto engage in this
is actually going to be much\nmore significant than it
has been in the past.
And then there are\nsome markers that we've
created through the reform\neffort that are now well-known.
They're understood.
And once they're out there,\nwe have a new data tool.
Those sorts of things, they're\nnot going to be pulled back.
And so that will create\nopportunities for others
to move forward, even if the\nfederal government is not
out in front as the champion.
And so one of the punchlines\nI think for all of us
in thinking about the era\nthat we're currently in
is that we may be back\ndown to the grassroots.
This may be an era where we\nhave to turn to ourselves
at the local level in community\ngroups and in local governments
to be the change and to\nmake the change happen
to advance the things that\nwe value as a society.
All right.
So that's the summary.
What I want to do is start with\nthe foundation of all of this
and why we still need\na Fair Housing Act.
Now, I assume if you\ncame here, you already
know a lot of the history.
So I'm not going to go\nthrough a lot of that
to say that this is an issue.
But I did want to\njust talk about this
in a more broader\ncontext by starting
with the notion of\neconomic mobility.
So economic mobility is\nthe idea that if you're
born in a certain\nstation in life,
through hard work and effort\nand building yourself up,
you can get to a\ndifferent station.
And this is something that\nI actually talk about a lot
now as the president\nof the Atlanta Fed.
I think it shocks people\nsometimes that I'm
talking about economic mobility\nas an important aspect of what
we do, but one of our mandates\nis maximizing employment.
And the definition or\ndefining what that means
depends on how many people\nare actually employable.
And so to the extent that\npeople are not employable,
that there are barriers that are\npreventing them from achieving
wages and the human capital\ndevelopment that is necessary,
then our benchmark for\nwhat full employment
looks like or\nmaximized employment
is lower than it should be.
And so it's very important\nto me and to our institution
that we reach out\nand engage and try
to identify the\nbarriers to maximize
the number of employable\npeople in the workplace.
And we don't always have\nthe tools at the Fed,
but we do have a podium to stand\non and yell from and with that,
try to convince people\nthat this is something that
is important for all of us.
And it really does\nhelp everyone really
believe in the American dream\nand believe it applies to them.
And if we can get\neveryone to believe that,
I think we wind up in a\nmuch more productive place
as a country.
And so we talk about\nthat all the time.
And I think that fair\nhousing is at its heart
about economic mobility\nbecause Shaun often
said housing determines\nso many things.
Where your house is\ndetermines what school system
you go to, what\njobs are accessible,
whether you can spend\ntime out on the streets
because they're\nsafe or not safe.
And if your house is not in a\nplace where those amenities are
positive, then your ability\nto have real economic mobility
is limited and constrained\npretty significantly.
And so segregation\nand discrimination,
the things that the Fair Housing\nAct really tried to attack,
were constraints to prevent\nAfrican-Americans and people
of other protected classes to be\nable to have housing in places
where the foundational elements,\nthe schools and the like,
would give them true\naccess to opportunity.
So there's a large literature\non the history of discrimination
in this country.
If you saw the New York Times\narticle or the editorial that
came out on Sunday about\ninstitutionalized segregation,
a lot of those policies\nwere discriminatory policies
explicitly, the racial\ncovenants and the like.
And the Mortgage\nBankers Association--
actually, this is a funny place\nI wouldn't have expected it,
actually.
Dave Stevens doing\nsome good things--
has a nice history of the\norigins of the Fair Housing Act
and how it was a 40- and\n50-year struggle to get to that.
And that was quite important.
I would say that I had\nthe pleasure of overseeing
the conduct of the decennial\nantidiscrimination study
that HUD does as Assistant\nSecretary of Policy Development
and Research--
still trying to\nquantify and understand
the ways that discrimination\nhappens in housing markets
so that way, we can then\nstart to craft responses.
And so there's still a lot\nof work to be done there,
but there has also been quite\na lot of progress because
of the work that a lot\nof researchers have done
and a lot of brave\ncitizens to stand up
and say that these\nthings are not right.
Segregation is also\na major impediment.
And I'm not going to\nsay a lot more on this,
except to say that\nsegregation in and of itself
would not be a problem if\nall the amenities that I've
been talking about\nwere evenly distributed
across the population because\nthen the location of where
you were would not matter.
But as we all know,\nthat's not really real.
And so to the extent\nthat those things are not
evenly distributed\nacross our space,
then place actually matters\nin a significant way.
And then segregation\nbecomes really
the equivalent of\nlimiting economic mobility
and limiting people's ability\nto pursue the American dream.
So when we think about\nfair housing, for me,
it's not just the housing.
It's actually the context in\nwhich that housing operates
and is located.
And so when we talk\nabout fair housing--
and this is what we did, and\nI think it was important--
it's important to really\nspend a lot of time
telling people and explaining\nwhy fair housing is important.
And it's important for those\neconomic mobility reasons.
And to the extent\nthat we are not
seeing that economic\nmobility, that
imposes costs for the\nfamilies themselves.
But ultimately, it\nimposes costs for society.
And in a world that is\nincreasingly competitive,
we should try to not have those\ncosts, to the extent that we
possibly can.
So everyone should leave here\nand start talking fair housing
as an economic development issue\nand as a personal and community
development issue because\nultimately, that's what it is.
All right.
So with that\ncommercial, so I like
to give homework in my talk.
So that's part of your homework\ntoday, to go tell people,
did you know fair housing's\nabout economic development?
So anyway, for the rest of\nthe talk, what I'd like to do
is really chronicle where we've\nbeen in terms of fair housing
and then where\nwe're likely to go.
And it's really going to\nfocus on the two areas,
affirmatively furthering fair\nhousing and on the enforcement.
Now, I'm going to start\nwith affirmatively
furthering fair housing.
I spent a lot of time on this.
And whenever I start writing\non fair housing issues,
I naturally gravitate\nto this because just
I got pulled in so deeply that\nit's hard to not start there.
So when we think about\naffirmatively furthering,
it was actually in the act.
And the first HUD\nSecretary, George Romney,
tried to actually\ndo it, and he tried
to have communities\nbe engaged in taking
affirmative steps to reduce\nand eliminate segregation.
The communities complained\nto the White House,
and President Nixon\ntold George to stop
and ultimately forced\nhim out of office.
And so that was the\nfirst experience
with affirmatively\nfurthering fair housing.
And so for years after that,\nHUD tiptoed in the space
because they knew that\nthere were political issues.
And it really did\nintroduce this challenge
between the federal government\nand local government
and who gets to decide what\nhappens at that local level.
Ultimately, there was a\nframework that was developed,
and this should be the\nconsolidated plan, not
the comprehensive plan.
And they announced a framework\naround consolidated planning
where, as part of\nthe planning process,
communities would have\nto do something called
an "analysis of impediments."
And the Analysis of\nImpediments, which
you may hear people\ntalk about the AI,
was really designed to\nincentivize jurisdictions
to identify all the\nimpediments to fair housing,
like what are the things\nthat are not working locally
in the fair housing\nspace, and then
to start to craft some\nsolutions around this.
Now, it turns out that while\nthis was nice in concept,
it actually didn't\nwork in practice.
And it didn't work for\na couple of reasons.
First, HUD did not put\ntogether a lot of resources,
did not devote a\nlot of resources
to be a meaningful monitor to\nmake sure that these AIs were
done and then reviewed.
So there were lots of\nAIs that came to HUD,
and HUD would take six,\neight years to review them.
And at that point, they\nwere kind of moot, right?
And so the GAO did an\nanalysis of this process.
And in the analysis,\nthey took a survey of AIs
that were on the shelves at HUD.
40% of them were\nolder than five years.
Now, the reg said\nyou're supposed
to do them every five years.
So 40% of them were\nolder than that.
11% were older than 10 years.
And it gives you a sense of\nhow HUD was engaging in this.
And once communities understood\nthat, they were clearly going
to do as little as necessary.
Just get a report\nup there, and then
do whatever you want to do.
So there really\nwasn't a commitment
to fair housing in\nan affirmative way.
So we come to 2008.
There's an election.
President Obama is\nelected, and Shaun Donovan
gets named and confirmed\nas the Secretary
of the Department of Housing\nand Urban Development.
And one of the things\nthat he committed us to do
was revisit this whole process,\nthis affirmatively furthering
function.
Now, it turned out to\nbe quite difficult.
And in part, it\nwas because there
was tension between the\nfair housing advocates
and the community\ndevelopment advocates
because the notion\nof fair housing
was far narrower than how\nI've been talking about it.
And it caused the\nconversation to not
go to constructive places.
So one of the things that we\nactually did that was, I think,
quite innovative was to\nexplicitly articulate
fair housing in a broader way.
And then it took a couple\nyears to get everyone
into the same tent\nand understand that.
But ultimately, it\nunleashed us to really
have a unified approach to\nthinking about fair housing.
So it worked.
All right.
So the goal of fair\nhousing is equal access
to economic opportunity.
That's another way to say\nmaximizing the potential
for economic mobility.
And that was actually quite\ninnovative and revolutionary.
I can't take credit for it.
That was written, and it was\nin long before I got there.
But I was put in\nthe place of trying
to convince everyone that we\nwere really going to do this.
And so I can't say it was\nfun, but it was a learning
experience in a lot of ways.
A second thing that emerged\nfrom this new framework
was a focus on racially and\nethnically concentrated areas
of poverty.
And one of the\nthings that we wanted
to do as part of\nthe rule was really
try to give some guideposts\nas to what the most
important problems were, that if\nyou had these kind of problems,
then these are things you\nshould really pay attention
to because in\nprevious iterations,
there was not really a lot of\ndiscussion about what the most
pernicious issues were.
We pointed to this because\nthere's a huge body of evidence
which shows that those\nconcentrations of poverty
are a big problem in\nand of themselves.
You think about the large public\nhousing projects and the issues
that emerged out of that.
And then you overlay\nrace on top of that,
and it's sort of a double\ndoozy until those places become
extremely costly,\nextremely isolated,
and they impose extra\ncosts on society.
So we wanted to call\nthat out and really start
to socialize everyone\non the ideas of how
we are distributing our people\nhas real implications for how
well we're going to work.
And to the extent that we can\nget people to understand that,
that's important.
A third innovation\nthat we started
to put in place\nthrough the new format
was to try to have HUD\nbe viewed as a partner
at the local level.
Now, I talked about enforcement\nand affirmatively furthering.
HUD got the enforcement down,\nand many local communities
didn't like to talk to HUD\nbecause the only conversations
that they ever had were\nin the context of you're
not doing something right.
We're going to sanction you.
We're going to hold your money.
We're going to do all\nthese sorts of things.
And so it was very difficult\nto get many jurisdictions
to want to talk about\nfair housing at all
because in their view, the only\nthing that fair housing did
was bring them\ncloser to a lawsuit,
and they didn't want to do that.
So what we wanted\nto try to emphasize
is that we have as a mandate to\nhelp you affirmatively further.
So we want to be helpful as\nopposed to rapping people
on their knuckles with a ruler.
The fourth innovation,\nwhich I think
is perhaps going to be the\nmost important of all of these,
is the introduction of\na new geospatial tool.
So I'm expecting\nmany of you have
been to a planning commission\nmeeting or a city council
meeting where you've seen a\nbusiness representative get up
with a table of data and\nstart dazzling people.
And the community is at a loss.
They don't have the same\namount of information,
so the conversation\nis imbalanced.
It's out of balance at\ndecision making times.
So what we wanted to do and\ndid quite effectively was say,
OK, we're going to\ndemocratize data.
We're going make it\neasy for everybody
to do the same analyses so\nthat when someone gets up
and they present their\ndata, you can get up
and present the data\nin a different way
to make a different point and\nhave the conversation really
get to a place where we weren't\ndebating about the data,
and everyone had the same data.
So it was a level playing\nfield so that there
can be a shared and unified\nappreciation for what
the challenges are in\nthe local community.
And then the fifth\ninnovation was a new tool.
So we replaced the\nAI with something
we called an "assessment\nof fair housing."
And the assessment of fair\nhousing had a lot of elements.
So I know there are a lot of\nwords on this table, so don't
read the words.
Just know that the fact that\nthere are a lot of words
should be instructive, in the\nsense that our initial goal was
to try to make this as simple\nas possible for jurisdictions.
We have six areas.
The summary is long.
The data analysis is long.
The assessment of\nthe issues is long.
So we wound up\ncreating something
that I think touched on all\nthe elements that we think
are important but in a\nway that ultimately I
think was not as user-friendly\nas we might have hoped.
What we were hoping for was that\njurisdictions would actually
do this on their own.
So in the AI world, what\ntypically happened was
your years came up.
You knew you had to do an AI.
You put out a contract.
You hired a consultant.
They did the whole thing.
They knew what the\nstandard was, and they
would come to the city council.
Maybe they'd read it.
Maybe they wouldn't read it.
But they knew they had to\nget it in, so they got it in.
And we wanted to change that.
We wanted to have fair\nhousing be something
that was understood and\nembraced and wrestled
with by all members\nof the community.
So our goal was really\nto have a product that
was easy to do because that\nease would then mean that people
would not be afraid.
They wouldn't be intimidated,\nand they could instead really
go to the meetings and\ntalk to people about things
that are really important.
All right.
So that was the framework.
That was sort of the innovation.
Now, in our chapter,\nwe talked about what
are the risks for this working.
And if this framework is\ngoing to work, what will we
need to see to have this work?
And we identified eight areas\nthat would be important.
Now, I want to talk\nthrough the eight,
and then I'll talk\nabout how we're doing
in each of these categories.
So the first is that HUD must\nhave sufficient capacity.
So in order to do this, this is\nactually a change in approach.
We wanted to make HUD\naccountable to itself
and to jurisdictions.
So that would mean that\nwhen the AFHs came in,
they actually had to\nbe read and reviewed.
And a decision needed to be\nmade in a fixed amount of time
so this wasn't hanging\nout there over the head
of a jurisdiction.
There needed to be\nopportunities for jurisdictions
to ask questions and\nto talk with people
and to bounce ideas off of\nthem and to understand what
the department was thinking.
And this was just\ngoing to change really
in a fundamental way the\nallocation of resources
inside HUD.
And so HUD needed\nto make sure it
had the capacity to\ndeliver on all the demands
that we were putting on it.
The second is that HUD had to\nhelp increase local capacity.
So in many local\ngovernments, they
don't have a lot of resources.
They're not in a position to\ntake on a new responsibility.
And if we're really serious\nabout having them do it,
we need to put resources in\nplace to make it easy for them.
And so HUD needed to do that\nby either doing it themselves,
developing courses,\nproviding guidance, or hiring
intermediaries to\nprovide those services.
The third is the\nprinciple of local primacy
must be honored and respected.
The one thing that\njurisdictions worried about more
than anything else\nin this framework
was that the federal\ngovernment was
going to tell them what\nto do, that no matter
what they thought\nwas a good idea,
there was going to be\nsome bureaucrat that
was going to come to\ntown and say, oh no,
this is the right answer.
And there would be no\nnotion that their experience
and their time and their\nknowledge of their community
would be able to credibly\nbe brought to bear.
And so we told our staff\nrepeatedly, if there is a plan
and it's credible and we're\nlooking to argue about
whether it's credible or not,\nwe're going with the plan
because we need to have\nlocals believe that they
get to use their\nbrains to figure out
what a good approach\nand good strategy is.
And if there's participation at\nthe community level in the way
that we expect, it should\nbe a collective decision.
This won't be two people in\na room making a decision.
So we should honor that\ncollective very significantly.
The third is that if\nwe're going to have
the principle of local\nprimacy, then the locals
have got to really take it\nseriously and do it well.
They've got to send\ntheir staff to meetings.
They've got to have\nmeetings with communities.
They've got to produce the\ndata and wrestle with it
and work and really have\na good faith effort.
And I will tell you that\ninside of the building
when I was at HUD, this\nwas one that HUD people had
a big problem with.
They did not actually believe\nthat most jurisdictions would
put a good faith\neffort together.
The way I describe\nis there are really
three types of\njurisdictions notionally.
There are the ones who\nare the super achievers.
They want to do\neverything great.
So they're going to\ntake this, and they're
going to do it excellently.
Then there are going\nto be the folks that
aren't going to do this\nunder any circumstances.
They don't believe in this,\nand they're going to say,
I'm not going to advance for\nhousing because I'm against it.
And then there's\neveryone else, the people
in the middle who they don't\nfeel that strongly about it.
But they're not going to go\nright out in front of it.
And the debate and what we\nall have to ask ourselves
is, what's the distribution\nof cities across those three
categories?
Is it that most are\nin the bad category?
Is it most are in\nthe good category?
Is it mostly in the middle?
And your prior about what the\ndistribution of communities is
has a real implication\nfor how you
want to design the regulation.
If you think\neveryone's a bad actor,
then you want to be\nmuch more prescriptive.
You want to be much more\nin an enforcement space
to make people do things.
But if you think everyone\nis in the good side,
then you just need to be\nsubjective and throw up
some ideas, and\nthey'll get it done.
And so we had a lot\nof debate about this.
And people were colored\nfrom their experiences
in enforcement activities,\nin fair housing activities,
and just general\nconversation, the conferences,
about what that answer was.
And that issue became\na huge barrier for us
in building consensus\ninstitutionally.
The fifth area is attention\nhas to be regional,
and we've got to\ngo beyond housing.
So I've talked a lot about\nthe go beyond housing already.
The regional is important\nbecause ultimately, economies
don't respect\njurisdictional boundaries.
And all of our metro areas\nare economic engines,
fundamentally.
They produce things, and we come\ntogether to do those things.
And so if you think at a very\njurisdictional level, the job
location or the school that you\nwant to access or the training
program, if it's not\nin your jurisdiction,
then it's outside\nof your purview.
So only by thinking regionally,\nby thinking collectively
about where are all\nof our amenities,
can we get a plan that's\nlikely to be positive in all
those dimensions.
And so the regional aspect\nwas actually quite important.
The data must be leveraged\nto give everyone a voice.
So we really wanted to make\nsure that this data tool got
in the hands of\nregular people and got
in the hands of newspaper\nreporters and people
outside of the usual\nprocess to try to say,
OK, you have as much\ninformation as everybody else.
You should not be intimidated\nto go to these meetings.
You should not be intimidated\nto have an opinion.
And if you do that, then\nthe community will be
your community as well\nas everybody else's.
That's a very important\nmessage that I
don't think many had\nheard very often,
and we hadn't really\ngiven them tools
to have a hope of\nreally believing that.
The next to last one's\nfoundations and nonprofits.
They've got to monitor\nand be partners,
be partners with the communities\nbut also be partners with HUD.
And in many instances,\nparticularly
in the nonprofit space,\nthey were adversaries.
They spent most of their\ntime arguing and fighting
with each other to try to get\na few extra resources here
and there, and those are\nnot constructive contexts
to be doing long-term planning.
You all have had\narguments with people,
and you don't want\nto sit down and then
be nice to them an hour later--
at least, me, an hour.
It takes me a little\nlonger than an hour.
And so if you've had\nyears of bad experiences
or negative,\ncombative experiences,
the idea that all\nof a sudden, you're
all going to get\ntogether has got
to be something that\nhas got to be purposeful
because it's not just\ngoing to happen on its own.
So we needed to have\neveryone position themselves
as partners.
And then the last one is that\nthe political risk must not
be fatal.
At the time we wrote\nthis, there were a number
of proposals in the\nCongress to really gut
the whole notion of the\naffirmative furthering
regulation and,\nas a consequence,
really make it impossible\nto do the things that we had
worked to try to put in place.
So those were the eight\nthings that we called out
as the preconditions for\nsuccess, if you will.
And so the question naturally\nis, where are we today?
And so I have my view,\nand I've put those here.
So the first is I talked about\nHUD having sufficient capacity.
HUD didn't add any capacity.
And in fact, HUD\nwent the other way
and said, because we\ndidn't add any capacity,
we're going to waive everybody.
So no one actually\nhas to do the AFH.
They can go back to the\nAI framework if they want.
So we didn't do very well here.
In terms of the second,\nincreasing local capacity,
I think there has\nbeen progress here.
In the appropriations\nfor the department,
HUD set aside a fair amount\nof money for third parties--
Enterprise Community Partners,\nassociates, and others--
to be available to provide\ntechnical assistance
and training for\nlocal governments.
And some have actually\ntaken advantage of it.
And so I think\nthere's progress here,
and that knowledge that\nthat exists in the space
will not go away.
That expertise will be there.
And so there's an\nopportunity for good things
to happen there.
In terms of principle\nof local primacy,
there's been progress\nhere, as well.
I have to say I'm pleased\nto be able to say this.
Many locals actually stepped\nup with interesting ideas that
may not have\ninitially been viewed
as in the purview of\nfair housing, really,
and HUD let them go\nthrough, which was good.
So example is Los Angeles.
Part of the AFH planning\nprocess resulted
in a new understanding between\nthe police and the transgender
community and how they interact.
There was creativity in terms of\nthe LA Unified School District
and their use of vacant land\nnear high-performing schools.
These are all things that\nwere not really being
suggested in an old framework.
So there was a lot\nof promise that
emerged out of the experience.
The locals must make\na good faith effort.
I think here, there's\nbeen some progress.
It's not as great as\nI would have hoped,
in part, I think,\nbecause of HUD's issues.
So many of the\ncommunities would ask
HUD for technical assistance\nand HUD was actually
quite slow in making those\nresources available, such
that by the time\nthe resources came,
the clock had ticked a lot.
And so we were just in a\nrush to get something in,
which means that the good faith\neffort that we had conceived of
is really going to be cut\nshort pretty considerably.
But I think that\nthat can be remedied.
In terms of the attention\nbeing regional, extending
beyond housing, we saw a\nnumber of jurisdictions
in the early rounds really\nembrace the regional notion.
From Chicago to Denver to New\nYork City, all of these places
were places that\nreally tried to think
about this in a regional way.
And I think they were getting\nit in a pretty significant way.
Very much a significant\namount of progress
in terms of data leveraging--
there is quite a lot\nof infrastructure
that was put in\nplace, and people
made themselves use of it.
One of the things that\nwas learned through some
of the early rounds\nis that for people
who are not used to working\nwith data, who haven't had
the opportunity to wrestle\nwith things and play around,
they need space before\nthe meetings just
to figure out what to do.
So creating opportunities-- and\nthis is a role for foundations,
I think, to provide--
is some safe time and\nspace where they just
come, wrestle with the\ndata, and try to figure out
what it means for themselves.
And so if they can do that,\nwhen the meeting happens
at the community level,\nthey're in a position
to be articulate about\nexactly what they think.
And it should give\nmore confidence
that that voice will\nbe taken seriously,
and I think that's something\nthat we should hope for.
And then in terms of the\nfoundations and nonprofits
being monitors and\npartners, I think
there's been a fair\namount of progress here.
And for me, I talked with some\nfolks who monitored the process
in a number of these cities.
And what they said\nwas they were struck
by how many nonprofits\ncame to the table
believing they understood\nwhat it meant to try
to run a city department.
And then they got in\nthe room and started
making their demands, and the\ncities told them, well, we only
have a third of the money\nthat you think we have.
And those constraints then\nchanged the calculus around
what's possible, how do\nwe do prioritization,
how do we engage long-run, and\nI think it brought the groups
closer together because in many\ninstances, I got a sense that--
actually, I experienced this.
Nonprofits would\ntalk to me and say,
you're just being difficult\nto be difficult. I was like,
no, we're being difficult\nbecause this is hard.
We don't have a lot of\nresources to do these things.
And so we need to\nbe extra creative.
There are many things\nthat seem like good ideas
that we don't have\nthe resources to do.
And by making it\nreal, I think there
was tremendous value in that.
And then the political\nrisk, it remains.
It probably remains\nfor different reasons,
but there are some\nreal challenges
to think about in\nterms of whether
the political\nenvironment that we're in
is going to be conducive to a\nreal embrace of affirmatively
furthering fair housing, of\nbeing positive in fair housing
to try to create equal access to\nopportunity and to communities.
All right.
So that's where we are.
Now, I've already\nsaid I'm pretty
optimistic that many of\nthe elements that we've
put in place can be positive.
I wanted to say a few\nwords on enforcement,
and then I'll wrap up.
So enforcement has always been\na prominent aspect of the act,
and it was trying to\nmake progress where
fair housing is concerned.
Many instances, it\nwas HUD officials
doing the enforcement.
And in many other\ncircumstances, it
was communities and\nnonprofits suing
HUD to do the enforcement.
And at one point,\nwhen we came in,
there were a ton of\noutstanding lawsuits
that had not been resolved.
And with Shaun's leadership,\nwe resolved all of them.
I think by the time we\nwere done, I got to do one.
Was mine the last one?
I think it was close to the end.
So I got a lot of gray hair.
About a third of it was from\nthat working on that project,
but it was because\nin many instances,
these issues are\nchallenging the way
that the HUD programs operate.
HUD is a conduit for resources,\nand then the decisions
get made somewhere else.
And so in that kind of\ndistributed context,
there's a real question\nabout who is accountable
and who should be accountable.
And there's a lot of\nwrestling that happens
within the government\nabout that,
within the courts about\nthat, and among communities.
And many of the\nresolution issues
are really centered on this\nquestion of accountability.
Most recently, there was\nthe disparate impact ruling
that the Supreme\nCourt made in 2015.
This was something\nthat had been I
think long dreaded by the\nfair housing community
and an expectation\nthat this would not
be viewed as positive or\npossible or even legal.
But the Supreme Court found\nsomething quite different,
which was interesting.
I think that it will be\nuseful moving forward
in affecting the types of things\nthat will receive scrutiny
from a practice perspective\nand hopefully will
eliminate a number of the\nbarriers that currently exist.
Now, the last thing\nI wanted to say
is I don't expect\nthat we're going
to see a lot of creativity\non the affirming side,
on the positive side, on\nthe partnership side, given
the steps that we've seen\nin the Department of Housing
and Urban Development\nin the last year or so.
So it may be the case\nthat moving forward,
this is going to be where\na lot of the action is.
And as I said, this\ndoes not make me happy,
in the sense that I'd\nrather have people
do the things because\nthey want to do them,
because they understand the\nvalue in doing them, rather
than dragging them and forcing\nthem to do things because that
creates a relationship that\nis less likely to be positive
and embracing over\nthe longer run.
So if we can try to return\nto some level of balance,
I think we will be\nin a better place.
All right.
So to wrap up, this is\nthe Fair Housing Act.
It's a landmark\npiece of legislation.
Tomorrow, it becomes\n50 years old.
And it really did\ncreate a sea change
in terms of how we should\nthink about housing markets
and what works for\npeople and what
we should expect people\nto experience as they
engage in housing markets.
It has not solved\nall the problems.
We still have a fair\nnumber of problems.
But it did create\na framework that
allowed us to start\nto attack them
and to try to make progress\nand make points that reduce
the number of people\nwho are constrained
in their pursuit of the American\ndream for housing reasons.
There are maybe other issues,\nbut in the housing space,
we definitely have\nmade progress.
I'm actually quite\noptimistic moving forward,
and I would say that\nin today's world,
I think there are\nmany people who
understand that economic\nmobility is at risk.
So I spend a lot of time flying\naround the country talking
to regular people, business\npeople, community folks.
And all of them see\nthe tremendous change
that's happening in the\neconomy and understand
that the expectations about\nwhere they're going to be
and where their\nchildren are going to be
are quite different than\nthey were 20 or 30 years ago.
And so this notion\nthat we should
be trying to do all\nthe things that we
can to maximize the likelihood\nof having every person have
access to economic mobility\nis something that I'm finding
resonates with people.
And so this may be a\ntime to really start
to talk about the notion\nthat fair housing is
just part and parcel of all the\nthings you're thinking about.
And it can be part\nof the solution
as we move forward to make\nsure that the next generation
and the generation after that\nare living in an America that
really does work and provides\naccess to the American dream.
So I will stop there.
And I guess there's\ntime for question,
so I'm happy to do that.
Thank you.
[applause]
Just if you have a question,\nplease identify yourself.
And as David Luberoff\nis want to say,
"A question does end\nin a question mark."
But raise your hand.
We have microphones\non the sides.
Was a question over there?
Yeah.
Right behind you.
Yeah.
Bill Carlson-- retired.
I'm interested in how Dodd-Frank\nhas affected the availability
of funding for housing.
So that's a\ncomplicated question.
So this is a very\ncomplicated question,
so bear with me because\nthere's a little history
I have to do to get there.
So everyone knows we had a\nhousing crisis in the 2000s,
right?
And that housing crisis\nhad as its origins a lot
of challenges in the flows\nof capital and credit,
such that people were\nable to get access
to a whole lot more capital\nin much more risky contexts
than they probably\nshould have been.
Dodd-Frank was a response\nto that and to say,
we're going to get rid of all\nof the ability for the Wild West
to prevail in an\nenvironment where
there was no accountability\nfor long-run performance
of the mortgage.
And so on one level,\nDodd-Frank was
designed to limit the\navailability of credit, to say,
if you're going to get credit,\nyou have to be credit-worthy,
you have to have\nan ability to pay,
and you need to understand\nthe risks associated
with that mortgage product.
And so while it has limited\naccess to capital on one level,
I think as a proportion of\nthe capital that's flowing,
it's increased the\namount of capital
that's going to\nsustainable mortgages
and to sustainable\nhomeownership.
So we're not seeing\nthe same sort of chaos
that we were seeing before.
So it depends on your\ndefinition of what access is.
For me, our administration\nwas the first presidential
administration I\nthink in 70 years
to not say homeownership\nwas a goal.
But rather, sustainable\nhousing was a goal.
Our people need to\nbe housed stably
in a way that makes sense,\nand I think Dodd-Frank
was constructive in that way.
Hi.
I'm Aaliyah Batia.
I'm a native Atlanta resident\nand a master in public policy
student.
My question is, for those of us\nwho work in additional related
areas-- like education,\nworkforce development,
politics, organizing--
what are the things\nthat we can do
to be allies in those\nspaces for fair housing?
So a very good question,\nand I'm loving Atlanta.
So I'll bring a hello\nback home for you.
A lot of things-- so\none is just find out
who your housing people are.
I've been amazed at\nwhen I go to a city
and I'm sitting with\nhousing people, I'm like,
do you know the\ntransportation people?
Do you know what\nbuilding they're in?
Just basic relationships\ndon't exist.
And you can't find\ncreative solutions
if you actually don't\ntalk to the other people
that you need to\nbe creative with.
So that's the first thing.
Just find out who they are.
Talk to them.
Take them to coffee or whatever.
A second is to really be mindful\nof where assets are located.
So to the extent that\nyou're in education,
where are your flagship schools?
Where are your\ntraining programs?
Do you have after-school\nstuff, and are they
close to the places of\nneed in your community?
And try to make sure\nthat you understand
the flows that go together.
And then a third thing is talk\nto people in your community
and really try to understand\nthe things that they
see as barriers and\nunderstand how people actually
live in the community\non a day to day basis
because a lot of\ntimes, I'll have
an idea of what a problem is.
But I can be totally\nwrong because I
don't have the same\nappreciation as people
who are trying to\nlive with challenges
that are unfamiliar to me.
So talk to people, and that\ncould give you directions
on who else you need to know.
Is it the housing people?
Is it the health people?
Is it the transportation people?
And the other thing,\nthe fourth thing--
I keep adding things now--
is figure out who actually has\nmoney because they're the folks
you want to be friends with.
And if you can do\nthat and convince them
that they have an interest in\nworking with you to advance
things, then you now have\na partner with resources
that can help you craft things.
Sometimes, it's foundations,\nbut you can look at hospitals.
You can look at the\ntransportation money
because there's a lot\nof transportation money.
So thinking about who\nyour allies should be
is something that's\nquite important.
Yeah.
Identify yourself, please.
Yeah.
I'm George McCarthy from\nthe Lincoln Institute
of Land Policy.
So Raphael, the\nway you set this up
was that fair housing was a\nresponse to a systemic problem
in the housing market.
The market actually\nwasn't working.
And the problem with the\nkind of enforcement--
we're doing litigation\nas enforcement--
is that litigation\nin piecemeal fashion
doesn't lead to a systemic\nresponse to a systemic problem.
And I'm wondering why is\nit the way we do litigation
doesn't lead to some signature\nprecedent-setting case that
then fuels a movement, something\nlike Brown versus Board
or something--
I don't know-- some\nmajor case that says,
now we empower everybody\nto go out and make
some kind of\nmeaningful challenge
that then leads to\na systemic response?
So that's a good question.
I think this is complicated.
And it has to do with\nthe will to enforce.
So you guys should\nread the MBA thing.
It was actually\nquite interesting,
as they chronicle the evolution\nof the antidiscrimination laws
in housing.
The first antidiscrimination\nlaw in housing
was passed in the '40s,\nbut the will to enforce
wasn't there to make it clear\nthat every person needed
to do this.
If you're a landlord,\nyou need to do this.
And so people just didn't do\nit, and there was no will.
And the difference-- now, this\nis actually quite interesting
because I was listening to\na podcast on desegregation
during the Civil Rights Act.
And the guy who\nwas talking, he was
one of the people\nwho just would go
sit in a store\nthat was segregated
and sit and want to get served.
And they wouldn't serve him.
And then the police would\ncome, and they'd walk him out.
And then when the Civil\nRights Act passed,
they came right back to\nthe same store, sat down,
and they served them.
And it was actually\nquite interesting.
And so there was a\npsychology around this.
They actually talked\nto the store owner.
I think this was\nmaybe an NPR thing.
I don't know if\nanyone has heard this.
And the store owner\nsaid, we think
discrimination's horrible.
The store owner said this.
But we would have kept\ndiscriminating because that's
just what we did,\nand we didn't want
people to tell us what to do.
And so it is very\ncomplicated, and it's
embedded in psychology and\nsociology and tribalism.
And it requires, I think,\na deep sustained engagement
and enough social profile.
So we don't have in housing\nthe equivalent of Selma.
We don't have that\nvisual thing that
links every person\nin the room and says,
oh, this is really bad.
And maybe until we get that--
but I'm hopeful we\ndon't have to get that.
This is why the affirmatively\nfurthering stuff is stuff
that I'm super hopeful about.
For those of you who\nare doing research,
any research you can do to show\nthat diverse places do better--
they're more resilient,\nand they grow faster,
all those sorts of things--
that is incredibly powerful.
It'd be incredibly helpful.
Now, we may not report\nyour paper directly.
We may fold it into a narrative.
But that's the\ntype of information
that we need to get so people\nunderstand that by doing this,
their interests are advanced.
And if that becomes\nthe general mindset,
I think we can get to\na more positive place.
But it's a very hard issue.
Hi there.
My name is John Griffith.
I most recently was at\nEnterprise Community Partners.
It's good to see you.
I know who you are, yes.
I'm now at the Kennedy School.
So you rightly said that the\nbig issue in fair housing
is connecting folks to\nareas with good schools
and other opportunities.
And there's two sides\nto that, obviously.
There's getting people to the\nneighborhoods that already have
that, and then there's\nmaking the investments
into the neighborhoods\nthat don't have that
and making sure that\nthey're not abandoned.
I'm wondering whether, either\nin your time at the Fed
or in your time\nearlier, whether you've
seen examples of cities that\nare doing the latter well
and whether you see any\nopportunities on the horizon,
either through opportunity\nzones or other kind
of federal issues,\nto help make sure
that we're not\nabandoning neighborhoods
of concentrated\npoverty that have
a deep history of disinvestment.
So it's a very good\nquestion, and I'll answer it
with a story to start.
So I was doing this AFFH work.
That's what we call the\naffirmative furthering.
And we started going\naround to cities.
I would do little road\ntours, the roadshows
to see if cities were OK\nwith what we were proposing.
And at a couple of the cities,\nthey were medium-sized.
It wasn't New York or Chicago.
They said, we don't actually\nreally like to do this,
but we have no idea\nwhat success looks like.
Can you tell us or show us a\ncity that actually does it?
And I didn't have a city\non my mind at the time,
so I was like, no,\nI'll get back to you.
And then I started going\naround and talking to advocates
and community folks.
And no one had that canon of\nplaces that was the success.
And it was kind of shocking.
And to me, it made me say, well,\nit's kind of almost not fair
that we're asking people to do\nthings that are under-resourced
and we're not given\nthem any hints
as to what a successful\nstrategy might look like.
So we actually started a project\nwhen I left to try to do this.
Now, we picked three\ncities, Portland, Seattle,
and San Diego.
And we are now going\nthrough and looking
at a number of the\nprojects and efforts that
have happened in those\nplaces to see if any of them
actually should make the list.
Our report is due in May, so we\nshould have some answers then.
But it is actually an incredibly\nimportant question that
should be on all of our minds.
Where is that success because\nit's not something that's
in the collective psyche.
So without that, we've\ngot a bunch of people
who are walking in the dark.
They're trying to feel\naround and figure out things,
and we need to do better\nto help that succeed.
In terms of policy, we'll\nsee how it plays out.
Things like opportunity zones,\nwe've tried those in the past.
They have not been\ntransformative
in almost all instances.
So I'm happy to be\noptimistic, but I
think we need to also be\nvery thoughtful about,
are we seeing success anywhere?
And if so, how many people\nare we telling about
it to get that word out because\nthat's very sorely needed.
Roger Herzog-- so you're\nat the Federal Reserve.
Our Fed here in Boston\ndid a very powerful report
within the last\ncouple years that
demonstrated the very severe\nincome inequality and wealth
inequality in our region.
So just connecting\nyour work at the Fed
with the issue of fair housing,\nyour advice to this young woman
was find someone with\nresources and get to know them.
Do you see a role for the\nFederal Reserve System
in trying to address our\nfair housing challenges?
So absolutely.
And when I talk to\npeople, one thing
that is a continuous\ntakeaway for me
is that nobody actually knows\nwhat the Fed actually does.
They have no idea what we do.
So they know something\nabout interest rates,
but that's kind of\nas far as it goes.
We actually have a staff\nin every Reserve Bank
and at the board in DC\nthat works on community
common development.
And their job is actually to go\nout and work with communities
to make them places that work.
We have the head of the\ncommunity development group
here from Boston,\nPrabal Chakrabarti.
It's good to see you.
And he's a great host.
If you ever get a\nchance to go over there,
you should go sit with his team.
But we're working on this to try\nto help communities figure out
what they need to be\nsuccessful for their residents
and then connect\nthem to the extent
possible with experts and\nresources and the like
to help execute that.
So here, we have a\nWorking Cities Initiative
that's trying to work with\nsome of the older cities
that have had\nheydays in the past,
but they're not heydays now.
And in my district, we\nare doing the same thing.
We're trying to find out who\nhas the energy and the desire
to go out and make a difference.
And then what things\ndon't you have?
And we'll get you in touch\nwith as many of those things.
If we have them in-house,\nI'll send some folks
to go deal with that.
If not, we'll find who can.
Another thing we've\nactually been working on
is trying to figure out\nhow to get philanthropy
to engage more deeply in sort\nof nontraditional, suspect
places, which we're\nin the sixth district.
There's deep need in the South.
But if you look at the\nphilanthropic penetration,
particularly from\nnational organizations,
it's limited\nrelative to the need.
And so we're trying to figure\nout what kind of structure we
can put in place and what kind\nof relationships we can create
to try to turn that around\nbecause we believe--
and I actually\nbelieve this is true--
we need to make sure\nthat the resources that
are interested in being\ndeployed in these spaces
get deployed to greatest effect.
And in some instances,\nthat's capacity-building
and leadership.
In other instances, it's to\nhelp seed some entrepreneurship,
if necessary.
In others, it's to\nput in people who
can help with school programs\nor to help revamp or revise
a curriculum.
We're agnostic as to what we're\nwilling to help facilitate,
but we're there to do it.
So you and everyone in this room\nand everyone who's listening,
you should feel free\nto ask the Fed things.
Ask us to help.
And I'm pretty confident we'll\nbe there, and we'll do it.
So Raphael, help us to get it.
I think you got\nto take that one.
[laughter]
And I'm sorry, Chris.
Sorry, Chris, but I'm going to\nnot follow instructions here,
and I'm going to end my first\nsentence without a question
mark.
Then I'm going to\nhave a question.
But I just want to say in front\nof everybody here, Raphael,
congratulations for\nthe incredible work you
did on this at HUD.
For those who don't\nunderstand, this
wasn't going to get done\nuntil Raphael got involved.
The Assistant Secretary for\nPolicy Development and Research
doesn't do fair housing,\nbut Raphael did.
And I think the commitment\nyou hear in everything
he's talked about to\nwhat I would describe
as a truly democratic\nprocess of getting everyone
around the table,\nlistening to them,
and getting them to\na place none of them
thought they could get to,\nthat's what Raphael did.
And that's why we have,\nat least tenuously,
an affirmatively furthering\nfair housing regulation.
So thank you for doing that.
Thank you.
[applause]
I also want to go\nback to something
you said relatively quickly.
And I think you rightly\nsaid it was a big change,
but I think it's\nimportant enough
that it's worth going back to.
And I want to ask\nyou about that.
This shift from just thinking\nabout fair housing as
about whether blacks and whites\nor other protected classes
are living together to\nnot only focusing on areas
racially but also\neconomically concentrated,
particularly areas of\npoverty, was one piece of it.
But we also did\na lot of thinking
about measuring fair housing in\nterms of access to opportunity
very literally.
What's the quality of the\nschools in your neighborhood?
What's the quality\nof the health care
or the jobs or other things?
And that was a pretty\nrevolutionary thing
to do, as well.
You had a pretty good\nscorecard on the risks,
but I'd love to\nhear your scorecard
on whether that view of\nfair housing as something
different than the way people\nsaw it before is actually
taking hold or not among\ncommunities but also
among fair housing advocates\nand a range of others.
Yeah.
Well, first of\nall, I can only do
what I did because he gave\nme the cover to do it.
And these sort of big things\ndon't happen without leadership
that's really committed to it.
So you were a force that was\nthere to really make sure
that when people acted\nup, which was pretty
much every day, that\nI could say, well,
we're going to do this, anyway.
So you can either\nchoose to be here,
or you can choose to watch\nus from outside the room.
But we're moving forward.
And they always\nchose to participate
because this is important.
And one thing I would say is--
and this is what I tried to get\nour team to really understand--
no one works at HUD--
well, this is\nprobably too strong.
But most people\ndon't work at HUD
if they don't care\npassionately about the mission.
Everyone in the room, we're\nhere because we actually
believe that these\ncommunities should really
work for everybody\nand that there's
a role for the federal\ngovernment to play
to help facilitate that.
And we may have different\nideas about what
the most important\nbarrier is or what
the most important challenges\nor what a strategy is,
but if we lose sight of the\nfact that we're all here
trying to get to the same place,\nthings can break down pretty
considerably.
And where we were,\nthey had broken down
pretty bad to where people\njust went to the corners
and just started\nyelling at each other.
I think that we've actually\nmade a lot of progress
on this, in the sense that\nfor a good eight years,
the community, whether it\nbe community development
community or the\nfair housing people,
heard the same thing,\nthat you guys are
pointing in the same direction.
You guys should be\nworking together.
You guys should\nbe engaged to try
to find solutions that advance.
We're not in an either/or world.
We're in a both/and.
Everything is going\nto be necessary.
And I do think that there's\nbeen a lot of progress there.
I have concerns that\nunder more stress,
there's a predisposition to\nrevert back to where we were.
And we've got to\nfight that because I
think we're stronger\ncollectively as a community
in making progress\nin something that's
really important to our\nsocieties if we're together
and if our energies are\nall mutually supportive.
And so this job doesn't\ngive me an opportunity
to really talk to a lot of\nfolks like that anymore.
But I haven't heard the\npassing explosion that I
used to hear six years ago.
Did you hear what\nhappened in Minneapolis?
Did you hear what\nhappened in New Orleans?
Did you hear what\nhappened in Phoenix?
I think that's\nhappening far less,
and those explosions\nwere among the allies.
These are the people\nwho like each other.
And so if we're\nnot hearing that,
I think that's a sign\nthat we've made progress.
And now, it's just a\nquestion of figuring out
how are we going to\ntake this progress
and turn it into something real\nand make sure that we continue
to see progress in as many\ncommunities as we possibly can.
I would say start\nwith the willing ones.
And the ones who don't\nwant to do it at all,
that's enforcement space.
We should feel free to use our\nenforcement in those areas,
but let's bring\nalong as many people
as want to and really start\nto see positive change.
[inaudible]
Hi.
I don't like following\nShaun Donovan.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, sorry.
Excuse me.
I'm Megan Sandel from\nBoston Medical Center.
So my question is about the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and
whether or not there are ways\nin which to push that envelope
and perhaps bring\nin new sectors,
like hospitals and\nhealth care, to invest
and whether or\nnot you would ever
envision ways in which\nCommunity Reinvestment Act
regulations could encourage\nthat collaboration and alignment
and be able to bring new\nactors and new capital
into this space.
So CRA is an important tool.
Everyone knows what CRA is?
I just want to make sure.
There's a proposed\nrevision to CRA--
well, a framework for revision\nof the CRA that has been just
issued last week by the\nTreasury Department.
I would encourage\neveryone to read it
because the idea of\nthe CRA was initially
predicated in a world\nwhere banking institutions,
they operate out of\na branch network.
And they don't really\ndo that anymore.
How many people here\nhave been in a branch
in the last six months?
[laughter]
Really?
Even the 10% is surprising.
And so in a world where\nbranches have become far less
significant, having\nthe requirements
to engage with community based\non that just seems misplaced.
So we need to be rethinking\nwhat it means for a bank
to have a community\nand how should
they think about serving the\nbroad range of that community.
The other thing I\nwould say is just
like I think fair housing is a\nbroader economic development,
the CRA is, as well.
And so I think we need to\nbe creative in our thinking
about what kind of activities\nare actually advancing
functional communities that\nprovide real opportunities
for their residents.
And it's my sense that\nthe set of activities
that has counted\nto date is narrower
than the set of activities\nthat should count.
And now, hospitals are\na tremendous engine,
a potential for employment\nand for economic development
and as an anchor\nfor communities.
We should think about ways\nthat we can help hospitals be
a part of the solution on this.
And so I'm open.
These issues and these\nprocesses can be difficult
and can trigger a fair\namount of wrestling.
But I think that this\nis another one where
I think we should\ntry to be thoughtful
about those situations\nwhere we're all
pointing the same direction.
And it's really just\nabout the details
as opposed to those\nissues where we may not
be pointing the same direction.
Then we have to have a\ndifferent kind of conversation.
But I talked to\nthe Treasury folks
as they were putting\nthis together,
and the fundamental things\nabout the world has changed,
so the regulation should change.
I think that's right.
And so now with all these rates,\nthe devil's in the detail.
But I think we all should\ntry to work together and be
a voice of how\nmuch of this needs
to be included to really\nshow a lot of progress.
Unfortunately, I think we're\ngoing to have to call it there.
Raphael, I want to\nthank you in part
for making sure you brought\nto us a note of optimism.
Many of you have heard\nme say this before.
We\'re called the "Joint\nCenter for Gloom and Doom"
because what we do is call\nattention to the problems
that we face and many of\nwhich have been intractable.
And I think this\ncertainly is one
that would be up there in\nterms of intractable problems,
but I think there is\nreason for optimism.
And I think one of the\nreasons for optimism
is that when we make progress,\nthere may be some retreat,
but a lot of that\nground is held.
And I think that this\naffirmatively furthering
fair housing is progress.
And while we're maybe\nin a little retreat now,
there's a basis\nthere for, I think,
a process that's\nreally valuable.
And I think Mac talked\nabout enforcement.
I think the piece of\nthis that really strikes
me is the community engagement.
Now, you said this is that\nwe're going to have change,
it can't necessarily just\nbe forced in from outside.
It's got to come from within.
And I do think there's reason to\nthink that there is motivation.
People do want to further\nthese issues of integration.
And I think having the data,\nthe analysis, and the process--
and CRA is a good\nlesson here because I
think the reason why\nCRA has been effective
is because of that\ncommunity engagement.
We have to have data\nand information.
That could be the\nsunlight you need,
but that community\nengagement is important.
So that's just my little--
I guess I didn't end\nin a question, either.
But you're the host.
You don't have to.
Before you say\ngoodbye to everyone,
do follow me on Twitter.
So I'm trying to get my--
I'm concerning a competition\namong all the bank
presidents about who\nhas the most followers.
I'm behind right now.
So get on there because we're\ndoing some great things.
And I've really enjoyed this,\nso thank you all for coming out.
[applause]
The last thing I\nwant to say is when
I have people like\nRaphael standing up here,
I have to remind myself that\nhe's the president of a Federal
Reserve Bank, in part\nbecause you're knowledgeable,
you're thoughtful,\nand you're very
broad-ranging in\nterms of what you know
and what you bring to this.
I had the same feeling\nwith Shaun Donovan
was HUD Secretary.
Really, I'm just so\ngrateful to have you
in this position of\nreally significant power
and influence, given\nwhat you bring to it.
So thank you for\nyour public service,
and thank you for being\nwith us here tonight.
Thank you.
[applause]
