Good evening.
Hi, everybody.
I'm Diane Davis.
I'm the chair of the Department\nof Urban Planning and Design
here at the Graduate\nSchool of Design.
And it is my honor\nand extreme pleasure
to be able to introduce\nProfessor Kees Christiaanse
tonight, who will be speaking\non the subject of inversion
and subtraction in urban design.
His keynote is a capstone\nevent, the capstone event,
of a conference organized by\nour doctor of design students
today, structured around\nthe theme of urban form,
and counting on the\nparticipation of some
of today's leading architectural\ntheorists, landscape
architects, planners,\nurban designers,
and geographers of built form.
And they're here\nin the audience,
and I hope you'll get a\nchance to chat with them
after the presentation.
Kees is doing double\nduty for us tonight
as he has already shared\nhis reflections and thoughts
this afternoon on recent\nurban transformations,
has filtered through\nhis own deep knowledge
and professional practice\nover the last 30 plus years.
And so we're so thankful\nthat he has also
agreed to give us a\nspecial lecture tonight.
It would be banal,\neven if somewhat true,
to say that Kees Christiaanse\nneeds no introduction,
particularly to those of us\nhere at Harvard's Graduate
School of Design.
He is, after all, one of\nthe influential scholars
and practitioners\nof urbanism today.
But as a chair of\na department that
houses two programs, urban\nplanning and urban design,
it is especially important\nand meaningful to me,
personally, to be able\nto introduce Kees,
because he has built his\nsterling reputation not just
around his many important\nbuilt projects, teaching,
and scholarly\npublications, but also
through his own active\nengagement with both
the fields of urban\nplanning and urban design.
In his very persona,\nand of course,
with his built\nworks and writings,
he has embodied the creative\ntensions inherent in any effort
to synergize the\ninsights, sensitivities,
and skills of these two\nseparate, but intertwined,
disciplines.
The achievement\nof this synthesis
is considered by many to\nbe one of the holy grails
of the design disciplines.
One way that Kees has advanced\nthis synthesis in his projects
and writings is by developing\nnew action paradigms
and alternative\nconceptual frameworks
for guiding interventions\nin the built environment.
He is known, for\nexample, as someone
who thinks about the role that\nbuildings and neighborhoods
play as "socializing machines."
And given my own\nbackground in sociology,
this concept, and his own\nlongstanding commitment
to paying attention to the\nexperiential dimensions
of urban design\nprojects, all reveal
a remarkable, transdisciplinary\nintellectual breadth.
Likewise, commentators\nhave observed
that much of his\nbuilt work shows
the influence of urban\nplanners and social activists,
like Jane Jacobs.
And I might similarly note that\nin this afternoon's discussion
of new trends in\nurban design and city
building, Kees eloquently\nframed his views on the limits
and possibilities of good\nurban design in today's world
as being hamstrung\nby individualizing
cultural orientations\nand transformed
political practices,\nboth of which
have emerged with a\nvengeance, in the context
of neoliberalism-induced\ndeclining state
efforts to actively\ndiscipline market actors
and forces in the service\nof the public good.
With that type of grounded\npolitical, economic approach
to understanding the\nbarriers to creating
equitable and inclusive urban\nconditions in today's world,
I would say that Kees speaks\nnot just to urban designers,
but to all of us who have faith\nthat the design professions are
central to creating\nmore sustainable,
just, and human\nurban environments.
Before I turn the\nmicrophone over to Kees,
let me just give you a brief.
And it can't be too, too\nbrief, but an overview
of his extraordinary\ncareer so far.
Kees Christiaanse studied\narchitecture and urban planning
at TU Delft.
In 1980, he joined the Office\nfor Metropolitan Architecture,
OMA, and was appointed\na partner in 1983.
In 1989, he founded\nhis own company,
now called KCAP Architects\nand Planners in Rotterdam.
In these firms, Kees\nfocused much of his work
on urban assignments\nin complex situations
and on how to guide\nurban processes.
And he's an expert in the\ndevelopment of university
campuses and in\nthe revitalization
of former industrial\nrailway and harbor areas,
as well as a supervisor\nthrough those works
of several international\nurban developments.
Throughout his career,\nKees has always
combined teaching and research\nwith his professional work,
generating fruitful\ncross-fertilization in frames
of thinking and modes of action.
From 1996 until 2003,\nhe held a professorship
for architecture\nand urban planning
at the Technical\nUniversity of Berlin.
And from 2013 to 2018 has been\nchair of the Urban Planning
Institute of the Swiss Federal\nInstitute of Technology--
is that time-- yeah,\nthat time is correct--
just until 2018 in Zurich.
And since 2010, he has been\ninvolved in the Future Cities
Laboratory in Singapore.
In 2013, he was\nappointed chairperson
of the External Advisory Board\nof the Architecture and Design
Department of Singapore\nUniversity of Technology
and Design.
Kees is also author of\nmultiple books and essays
about architecture\nand urban planning,
and they include The\nCity as a Resource:
Concepts and Methods for Urban\nDesign, The Noise Landscape:
A Spatial Exploration of\nAirports and Cities, The Potato
Plan Collection: 40 Cities\nThrough the Lens of Patrick
Abercrombie, and City as Loft:\nAdaptive Reuse as a Resource
for Sustainable\nUrban Development.
He was a curator of the\nFourth International
Biennale in Rotterdam in 2009.
Just last year, he was\nawarded the ARC17 Oeuvre
Award in recognition of his\ninfluences in the field,
and just recently was announced\nas a speaker for the World
Architecture Festival,\nor was in 2018.
There's probably a lot\nmore that I missed,
but I think we are\ngoing to let his words
and his work speak\nfor themselves
in the rest of the evening.
And so without further ado, let\nme introduce Kees Christiaanse.
[applause]
That was too much honor.
I'm very honored to be here.
Thank you very much.
And I would call myself a\nrather pragmatic practitioner
teaching urban design.
I retired a month ago from\nATR, and we had a big party,
and I released two books.
The one is the textbook\non the left-hand side
with some nice sketches.
And the right hand is the\nPotato Plant Collection
that Diane mentioned, with\n40 Patrick Abercrombie
maps of world series made by\ndifferent architecture schools.
I am a child of\nnot of the 68-ers,
but I'm a child of\nthe 67-ers, which
are the Provos in Amsterdam, who\nwere a little bit older than me
and who were much more\nplayful, and maybe also
productive, constructive\nin the sense of urban
than the Paris 1968 people.
The Provo movement was\nalso rather coming forward
out of a relation with the\nflux movement in New York,
instead of having a very\nstrong link to Paris.
This guy here is Luud\nSchimmelpenninck.
He was the head\nProvo, so to say,
and they organized\nprotests, performances,
political rallies.
But moreover, or\nvery importantly,
they produced projects.
One of the projects, they were\nalways wearing white Wrangler
suits, as you can see,\nand one of the projects
were the white plans.
They had the white\nhousing plan, which
led to the squatter\nmovement and which
led to me being a\nsquatter for 10 years.
They had the white bicycle\nplan, which you see here.
They had the white car plan, and\nanother number of white plans.
The white bicycle plan\nconsisted of a very modern idea.
Namely, we take a\nthousand white bikes.
We sprayed them all white, and\nwe distributed across the city
without locking them.
And all the people in the\ncity can use them, share them,
and just put them back when\nthey don't need them anymore.
This, of course, was\nin the pre-digital age
and, therefore, the bicycles\nwere thrown into the canals.
They were repossessed\nand locked,
or they were demolished.
And it's interesting that\nnow we have the means
to deal with that.
He was also-- left\nin the car, he
is, with a famous photo model\nof that time and the prototype
of the white car.
This was a very\nrevolutionary thing
because there was this\nshared electric car, which
you could be a member of.
There were eight stations\nin the center of Amsterdam.
You see down below\none of the stations.
Of course, they had\nvery heavy batteries
that took 24 hours to charge,\nor something like that.
So it went all a\nlittle bit slow.
And both the bicycles\nand these electric cars
ended up, in the morning,\nat the central station.
And then they had\nto organize trucks
to redistribute them because\notherwise, the system didn't
work.
Here, you see, below right,\nyou see Luud Schimmelpenninck
today, and he is still\nhaving a consulting
firm on urban mobility.
He develops menus\nand apps and systems.
And one of his\nsystems is car2go,
which is a electric\ncar sharing thing.
And on the top, you see the\nZero bike, which you all know,
which are also thrown in\nthe canal in the meantime.
These white plans were\ndeveloped, more or less,
at the same time when Yoko and\nJong came to the Hilton Hotel
in Rotterdam for their\n"Bed Peace" performance.
They did that because\nof the provos,
and they got a bike also.
Their concept was also\nto be dressed in white,
to be in white sheets, and\nto talk about peaceful things
and receive people that all had\nto be doing something in white.
And they had an\nintensive relationship.
Even the queen passed\nby in white clothes.
I don't have a\npicture out of that.
I think Luud\nSchimmelpenninck was
instrumental for this\nculture of sharing devices
within urban mobility.
He was really a pioneer.
And it has led, like I said\nbefore, to all kinds of systems
that we benefit from now today,\nwhich are extremely useful
and which also prevent\nthings like stealing
and demolishment, et cetera.
I worked from 1980 at OMA.
That means we founded OMA.
OMA was consisting of\ntwo couples in London.
There's [inaudible]\nand the cool houses.
And on the moment that\nthe leaders in New York
arrived in the Netherlands,\nRem got a question
to do three projects.
Then he asked his students\nto set up the office,
to let it look like an office.
And so we hired a place\nand then OMA started.
We had a lot of\ntrouble, but in the end,
it became very\nsuccessful, as you know.
And in the end, everybody\nwho is not Rem has to leave,
which is good.
This project was called\n[inaudible] in Amsterdam North.
It was one of the first\nport conversion areas.
In the top part, you see more.
And it was in the times of\nheavy residents participation
and political left wing regime\nin the city of Amsterdam.
It was a period when the\ninvestors had nothing
to say at all, and that meant\nthat the whole development was
kind of geared by the residents\nof the dock workers that
were living there, whose dock\nwas going to be converted.
And therefore, there\nare 1,372 social houses.
There's only social housing,\nsome schools, some community
centers.
And one type is row\nhouse, which you can see,
which we designed in such a way\nthat every bedroom could look
across his garden to the water.
And the front part\nwas urban villas.
Actually, the\nurban villages were
selected after they rejected\nthat we wanted to build towers.
This is the very A1\nsite in Amsterdam.
So this would be Battery Park\nin New York, as a comparison.
And it's still incomprehensible\nthat it was built,
and it's even more\nincomprehensible
that it is still\nthere and not replaced
by some kind of\nlarge environment.
The urban villas were\ntransferred to the Netherlands
from Berlin, because we knew\nOswald Mathias Ungers very
well, who, on the\nright-hand side,
made a lot of very\ninteresting sketches
for urban villas in Berlin.
And on the left hand is\nhis famous Roosevelt Island
competition entry, with also\na kind of mini tower villa.
Of course, the Germans in\nBerlin were extremely romantic.
They weren't always\non holiday in Italy.
And of course, the urban\nvilla is, more or less,
an Italian product in\nthe kind of environment
of density than\na German product,
and not at all a Dutch product.
But this project triggered the\nintroduction of the urban villa
in the Netherlands.
Before, it didn't exist at all,\nand transformed into a kind
of low cost housing.
And the advantage\nwas, of course,
that it is kind of\nan oriented object.
People feel identified.
Most people have two corners or\nthree corners to look around.
They have a few people\non one access point,
et cetera, et cetera.
So 12 years later, we\ndesigned the GWL area
to form a water\nworks plant, where
we created a scheme with urban\nvillas, of which all the house
doors had to be on the\nground, preferably.
If that was not\npossible, there should
be another interesting\naccess system.
And all the apartments\nhad a garden.
That means the ground floor\nhad to have a direct garden
on their living room.
The top floor had a roof garden.
And the sandwich houses\nin apartments in between,
they had an allotment,\nwhich you can see here.
And this created an\nenormous amount of eyes
on the street and accessibility,\nwhich makes this neighborhood
still the most socially\nsafe and vandalismless place
of all housing\nneighborhoods in Amsterdam.
I had contact with Jane\nJacobs at that time.
This is in 1991.
I was very impressed by her.
You all know her so I don't\ngo very much more into it.
But she wrote a very funny\nbook, Economy of Cities,
which you may have seen.
It's more like a\nnarrative, and it
says that the city came first\nand then agriculture, instead
of the reverse.
It's a very beautiful story.
This whole way of\nthinking led, in 2009,
to me curating the Biennale\nof Architecture in Rotterdam.
And we called it Open City.
Also, at the same\ntime, Richard Sennett
had his article and\nsome lecturing going on.
A lot of ideas\nconverted into this idea
of Open City, which, actually,\nwas also an idea of the 1967
Provo movements that were also\nlinked to people like Herman
Hertzberger and\nFrank van Klingeren,
which were structuralist\narchitects that already worked
on such ideas in the 1950s.
And for us, Open City was mainly\nthat you created conditions
for coexistence by creating\nurban structures that were not
blocking an exchange\nbetween people,
but fostering exchange\nbetween people.
So this is the forum\nof that exhibition.
You see there a big chess\npiece of metal, Vriesendorp.
And you see here a\nparametrically developed
urban globe, and\nsome other things,
which was, more or less,\na replica of the Meerpaal
in Dronten, which was the only\nbuilding in the Netherlands
that became a superstar\nbecause of famous television
Christmas held there.
It consisted of a box\nby Frank van Klingeren,
and it contained a theater,\nthe council hall, market,
sports fields, and\neverything was-- a school,
a supermarket-- and everything\nwas not separated acoustically.
Everything was one in one space.
That was his idea\nof the Open Society.
There were also a lot of links\nto pauper, in that sense.
Of course, it didn't function.
So if you go there now,\nit's still a nice building,
but everything is closed\noff and has petition walls.
In those times, we developed\nthe idea of doing design
as simultaneous chess.
So simultaneous chess means that\nyou do not take all those work
streams-- like infantilization,\nanalysis, vision, development--
linear, past each other, but\nyou switch them parallel,
like in the red colored\npart of the diagram.
And then, by doing that, you\ntrigger the creative moment
and you get shortcuts and\nassociations, sheer by the fact
that you switch\ncertain investigations
and certain process streams\nparallel to each other,
instead of linear.
And you do that both\nat the technical level,
as well as on the stakeholder\nlevel, as on the design level.
And we process that\ninto our projects.
One of these projects\nwas the Mullerpier
in Rotterdam, which was a\nharbor pier, in which we
did the urban design.
And we started the\nurban design together
with a couple of architects.
And in the end, the\nurban design was,
more or less, not\narbitrary, but kind
of a composition of typologies\nthat were developed,
and then put on the model,\nand then shifted to each other
by different architects.
And the reason was\nthat we thought
that a kind of idiosyncratic\nform of architectural buildings
would connect to the culture,\nor to the presence of harbor
cranes and other\nscale-breaking elements,
along the river of the\nmaritime technology.
And this led, among others, to a\nkind of architectural sculpture
reality and an urbanistic\nway of working with buildings
and public space that we called\nflip-flop, in which you are not
in a perimeter block situation,\nwhere you have streets carved
out of blocks.
You are also not on\na chess board, where
the buildings are objects.
But it oscillates in between.
Of course, our process\nbackfired a lot.
So during the crisis,\nthese two building plots
were not constructed, and\nthey were immediately occupied
by the residents,\nturned into playgrounds,
and into allotments,\nand I don't know what.
And of course, we could\nonly be agreeing with that.
In the meantime, there has\nbeen a paradigm shift--
now we talk about\n10, 15 years later--
in housing.
And housing is\nincreasingly personalized
as a commodity, but also\narchitects still have
some influence in\nthe Netherlands,
also as a kind of culture,\nand due to the fact
that our building industry\nis very rationalized.
In the meantime, with the help,\nalso, of digital technology,
we can develop row houses, or\nbrownstones, or townhouses,
if you like, that have\ndifferent access systems
and different configurations\nfor the same building
costs as formerly a block\nwith one architect and one
contractor would do it for.
That's a very interesting\nand optimistic condition.
And here, you see the\nlast block that we finally
negotiated with the people\nto give the land back.
Of course, in favor\nof something, as
under construction.
So I am also not familiar\nwith the phenomenon
of starchitecture.
Or we also do not work as iconic\narchitects, being a man of war,
but we are more\nlike a fleet that
coordinates their movements\nin between each other,
and the stakeholders are\nalso part of the fleet.
Of course, in a social\ndemocratic market economy,
this may lead to\nsomething like this.
It is the kind of\nextreme condensation
of individual initiative within\nan institutional framework.
And you can criticize it or not.
I think it has some very\nbeautiful features about it.
Of course, this\ndemocracy also leads
to what we call railway\naccidents, which
means that traffic\ninfrastructures are built.
Then because of the\ntraffic infrastructure,
old country roads\nhave to be removed.
Then roundabouts have\nto be introduced.
Then the roundabout has\nto have a piece of art
because the local\ncouncil prescribes it.
Then the piece of art is\nbeing designed by an artist.
And another artist designs\nthis sound protection walls
that are completely in contrast\nto what this other artist
makes.
And the result is a\ncomplete cadavre exquis,
or let's say not exquis, a\nkind of very bad combination
of all kinds of elements\nthat are, let's say,
the bad side of this\nkind of condition.
We worked, as I said, a\nlot in former harbor areas
and in renovation sites.
And we produced three books,\nCity as Loft, State Build
State, and Urban Loopholes.
City as Loft is about\nthe creative and cultural
activities on former\nbrownstone and harboursides.
State beyond state\ndescribes Shenzhen
as a city where the real\ncity centers are neither
the villages, neither\nthe city center,
but the former industrial plants\nthat have been transformed.
And Urban Loopholes describes\nthe parallel reciprocal
influence of the settling\nof creative industries
in the French\nconcession in Shanghai,
and the upcoming\nheritage consciousness
with the authorities.
This is, for instance, a type\nof site where we work on,
a former port, shipyard.
And above is about 1970, and now\ntoday, it's what you see below.
And it is a kind\nof rich palette.
And the interesting\nthing of today
is that these are really\nincubators of a changing
economy and of a changing\nsocioeconomic relationship.
Because were these areas former,\neither invaded by developers
and then changed into\nsomething exclusive,
or they were occupied\nby people like us
and turned into squats, artist's\nstudios, and temporary uses.
Today, there is\na fusion going on
between these low-budget,\nhigh-culture and high-culture,
low-budget, if you like.
So on the left-hand\nside, you see
one of the holes, which is\nturned into a city where
different people, mainly\nartists, can build
their own workshop and studio.
And on the right-hand side, you\nsee a low-cost Hilton hotel.
Doubletree is a series\nof Hilton hotel,
which practices\na kind of mimicry
towards the surroundings, and\nwhich is heavily visited hotel
for a startup firms that\nstarted, like left up,
and then consequently\nbecame successful.
And so you have, also,\nthe sometimes a little bit
disagreeable situation,\nthat the neighbor is still
having social money,\nsocial benefit
money, and the other neighbor\nhas become a millionaire.
But this is quite interesting.
So we did a lot of\nthese kinds of project.
This is another one where\nwe renovated warehouses.
And the developer\nfirst wanted us
to make expensive penthouses\nand lawyer's offices, and so on.
And we convinced\nthem that we should
make a combination of social\nhousing, of artist work,
and of, also, expensive stuff.
And the result is that we\nhave, in the plinth of one
of the buildings, a\nrestaurant Fifteen,
which is a series\nfounded by Jamie
Oliver, in which ex-delinquent\ncriminal youth are serving
the managers of\nthe holdings that
are having their office\nin the new architecture.
And of course, the architecture\nis related, in that sense,
to this cultural form\nof harbor and shipyards,
and therefore, also, we have\nbuilt in these rusty fleck,
these rusty spots, in it.
This phenomenon of low-budget,\nhigh-culture, high-budget,
low-culture--
which now is fused, which\nbecomes a complimentary,
a very interesting\nforce, which is also
connected to the new atomizing\neconomy of small firms
that is appearing in cities--
is becoming really mainstream.
And it is the artist of the\nurban design to work with that
and to take care\nthat it is going
a little bit in the\nright direction.
This is the railway station\narea in Zurich on the other side
of the tracks that we designed.
It looks like a\nstupid office concept,
but it is, I think, in\nterms of public space,
it's quite unique and strong.
And it consists\nof a podium area,
and then you are allowed\nto do some towers on top.
Connects to all the\nstreets in the surrounding.
And here, this is one\nof the projects where
we do so-called subtraction\ntechniques, which are not
really very special\nbecause you fellas already
did it for New York.
We do not create urban design\nguidelines from zero to up,
but we go from a big mass down.
We create a big mass and then\nwe subtract the public space,
the shadow and sunlight\nrules, and the few lines
that we want to see, and\ncertain, also, form aspects
that we would like to see.
And then you have a framework\nin which developers architects
can make their buildings.
And this works very well.
We did that in Rotterdam.
And you see the result\nthat's already--
that was the first project,\nin that sense, we did.
And this is one of the\nbuildings in Switzerland.
Of course, these buildings\nare a little more
conservative and retro\nthan in the Netherlands.
But what is super interesting\nis that its an enormous mix of
uses.
And one of the\ndeveloper buildings
was invaded by\nCosmos, and Cosmos
is the most well-known\nfringe cultural institution,
or foundation, in\nZurich, that decided,
sheer by the spot\nand this basis,
to settle itself\nin this building,
with its cinemas, bookshop,\ncafes, restroom, et cetera.
And now it is a kind of\nhot spot for the people
who protested\nagainst this project.
It's the most popular\nplace for the people who
protest against this project as\na wrong capitalist development
by the Swiss Railway\nreal estate company.
And to everybody's surprise,\nGoogle rented something
like half of the buildings.
Everything that is blue was\nsuddenly rented by Google,
and Google is kind\nof transforming
the architecture of our\nfriends who build there
into more spaces like on the\nright, relating to public space
and creating a\ndedicated condition.
Of course, they have a\nsecurity problem now.
And this is very, very\ndifficult to bring into harmony
with their original\nconcept of openness.
But still, it's much\nbetter than this kind
of total hermetic stuff,\nwhich is also transcending
into the apps and\nthe operating system
in your phone,\nwhich allows nothing
else but the company\nthat is housed
in this car-friendly building.
In the meantime,\nwe're working on more
of those spots in Zurich, also.
And it's very\nunique that the rest
of the available land\nthat is still in Zurich
is allocated to industry.
Why?
Because there is an enormous\ndemand of apartments.
It's like in Manhattan.
But still, the city has\ndecided all the municipality
land that is still left\nis reserved for industry.
Why?
Because the city says a\ncity cannot consist only out
of residence, and certainly\nnot out of only university
residents and bankers.
The city should also have a\nvital component of industry.
It should also not\nhave only services
because you need something\nthat need to be serviced.
And so this is going to be\nindustry, these former railway
areas.
And of course, they are\ngoing to be boosted and have
multiple laps and\nproduction facilities.
It's the introduction\nof vertical,
of flatted production in Europe.
It Happens both in\nHamburg and in Zurich,
which didn't happen before.
You see just realized\na building, the Noer,
where you can buy--
they produce these ugly bags\nthat all architecture students
wear, Freitag, these clumsy\nthings that are produced there.
But they are a very\ninteresting startup firm that
really meets these criteria.
And it produces an\nenormous spin-off
in the form of\nsocial environment.
Now, we work also on this\nphenomenon in Hamburg.
In the north of the river,\nyou see the HafenCity,
which is, more or less,\nthe most famous waterfront
project on the\ncontinent in Europe,
which we made a master plan\nin 1999 after competition.
But in the meantime,\nthe HafenCity
is due to its success.
And it's the vision by\nthe people who manage it,
not necessarily me\nor us expanding.
And one of the\nexpenses is the jump
across the river, which you\nsee where the stadium is.
This is a project\nthat didn't go ahead.
We made a design for the\ncity for the Olympic games,
but it was canceled\nby a referendum.
And as a stakeholder manager\nand simultaneous chess person,
you must take that very sportly.
But basically, like in\nthe Olympic legacy project
in London that we\ndid, this project
was firstly geared to create\na quality new urban district.
And secondly, then,\nthe question was
how to accommodate the Olympic\ngames in it and not vise versa.
And in this area,\nvery interestingly,
on the south side, there\nare still port activity.
And the idea is to\nintroduce, or to integrate,
port activity into\nresidential neighborhoods,
the pre-work for sound and\nemission insulation legislation
has been made.
And these typologies are really\na little bit taken from Asia,
also from Singapore, where\nthey have, of course, due
to the space problem,\nflooded factories.
But flooded factories now are\nemerging in Europe, not only
because of the space problem--\nbecause in the periphery
there's often a lot of space--\nbut because of the high end
development of the\nenterprises that
are there that have urban and\nwell-educated workers that
do not produce\nemissions and sound,
and therefore want to be\nin the city, and therefore
they have to go vertical.
So it's a kind of\ncrucial moment, at least
in middle Europe, and also\na little bit in Amsterdam,
how this production\naspect is going to evolve
in these kind of environments.
Another example is the railway\nstation area of Eindhoven
in the Netherlands.
So the top part is\nthe existing situation
and the south part is the\nfuture master plan that we made.
And again, it doesn't consist\nof traditional perimeter blocks,
which you may think, but\nit consists of, let's say,
atomized new economy with\nworking and residential towers
on top.
Eindhoven has a\ngenius development,
economic development.
It was very in crisis.
Why?
Because Phillips, the big\nmultinational electronic
company from the\nNetherlands, originally
decided, in the wake\nof the globalization,
to put its headquarters\nin Amsterdam.
And Eindhoven didn't want it.
And then they made\na deal that Philips
gives away a lot of their\nbuildings for free to the city.
And it gives away all it's\nnot used patents, which is
an enormous amount of patents.
And these patents are allowed\nto be used by any startup
firm that has the condition to\nsettle in the city of Eindhoven
preferably.
In one of the old Phillips\nfactories that you see here,
this creates an enormous boom.
These are, by the way, by the\nRem Koolhaas' grandfather,
who was also an architect,\nMr. Roosevelt, Rosenburg.
And in it, you have the\nwell-known co-working spaces,
of course, which\nis very efficient.
This is the co-work space in\nShanghai, where our office is.
We would never want to go out of\nsuch a space, because you have
more benefit than\ndisadvantages, also, when
you have certain personnel.
And what is obviously\nalso the case is
that in these kind of\nareas where we work,
this is in Zurich, where we\nalso work on the master plan.
And these are two projects\nby Gramazio Kohler Robotics
and the ITA, the Institute\nfor Building Technology.
They did not make the\nobligatory competition
and started to make buildings,\nbut they formed a group
and handed in a research\nproposal to make a building.
Because the building is going\nto be a research instrument
during the time of its\nlife and, therefore,
we use, also, buildings\nas a research instruments,
as experiment, instead\nof just making buildings.
So I think this trend is\ngoing on all across the world.
This is the Create Campus of\nthe Future Cities Lab of ETH,
but also MIT, TU Munich,\nYale are all grouped together
to create a kind\nof critical mass,
also with certain\nstartup activities.
And you see also that you\ncan find it beautiful,
or less beautiful.
I find it not so\nbeautiful because I
lost the competition for this.
But it is a space that\nis working very well
as intermediate ideas and\nkind of producing space
in these conditions.
We do a research on the\nmoment in Future Cities, which
is called the Grand Projet, the\nbig project, or mega project.
And we research eight projects\nLa De France in Paris,
King's Cross in London,\n@22 in Barcelona,
HafenCity in Hamburg,\nKowloon Station in Hong Kong,
[inaudible] in Shanghai,\nand Tokyo Station in Tokyo,
Marunouchi.
And we didn't find a\nsuitable US project.
And during this research, the\ncompetition was written out
for the new innovation district\non the high speed railway
terminal in Singapore, which is\nthis one, which competition--
oh, sorry--
which competition we won.
And we brought further--
I say we never invent something.
We never do an innovation.
What is innovation in our work\nis taking urban types and kind
of bring them a step further,\nor develop them further.
In Singapore, there's a\nkind of culture going on
of buildings, high rises, on\npodia, where mostly shopping
malls are in, and so on.
And then there\nare towers on top,
which contain offices,\nor residential buildings,
or hotels.
And in between,\nthere are skyguard.
And so for this area, which\nhad the maximum height
of 135 meters due to\nsome air corridors,
we decided that we\ndidn't want to do
a kind of ridiculous dwarfed\nskyline of Dubai, which
most of the offices in\nthe competition did.
But we made obligatory to make\nall the buildings flat roof,
134 meters high with\na maximum surface
and an obligation to\ncreate roof terraces.
Then we also created\na podium level,
which would be permeable, and\nwhich would not so much contain
these shopping malls, but\nwould primarily also contain
university campuses, or\nproduction, flatted production,
or research, and of course,\nalso, other kinds of amenities.
There's a new kind\nof test rule, which
is called the 100% green\nreplacement rule, which
means that every footprint of\na new building that you make,
you have to recreate the\nfootprint and surface in green
somewhere else on the building.
And this is not only\nlooking nice green,
but it's water absorbing,\nhelping to cool,
and I don't know what.
And so we did that\nand we comprised the--
sorry-- we comprised\nthe footprint
of the whole neighborhood\nby freeing up the high speed
railway corridor that\nyou see in the middle,
as this sinusoid part and\nthe shell as the station
hall, which was also saving the\nproject about three months ago
because the high speed station\nline was canceled by Malaysia.
And then they have\na phasing problem,
and we created this\nproject in such a way
that it can incrementally phase,\nindependent of the traffic
and public space\ninfrastructure, public transport
infrastructure.
So you see here this kind\nof comprised footprint,
very dense, but\non the other hand,
it leaves an enormous\namount of green space open,
and the streets are\nvery, very closed.
It is part of a corridor\nsystem that we helped
develop, the local authorities.
They are changing from a\ncentral area as the center
to a polycentric condition where\nJurong Lake District-- that
is our district-- woodlands\nand dampeners near the airport
are being new centers.
The one connecting to\nthe high speed railway
line, the second connecting\nto Malaysia, and the third
with the airport.
And then there are\ncertain accents
of corridor, functional\ncorridors, around them.
The brown one is the\nknowledge corridors,
where, also, our universities\nand the NUS and NTU
are already there.
You see a couple\nof these corridors.
They vary from very\ntraditional campuses,
too much screen and\nno public orientation,
to have succeeded projects\nby Zaha Hadid to C sar Pelli,
creating a kind of strange\namalgamation of colonial
architecture and Americanism.
But let's say it's\ngoing to be interesting,
and you see an\nimage of the roofs
of these podia of this new\nneighborhood, or district.
It's about 3 and 1/2\nmillion square meters.
It is based, like I said,\nnot on an innovation by us,
but it is created out\nof a gradual genealogy
of building new building\ntypes that is specifically
emerging in Singapore.
And this is the\nway the podia look.
These podia, like\nI said, permeable.
There is a hole.
Here we used quite some\nbig data server in order
to create the conditions\nfor natural ventilation
against air conditioning\nin the building blocks.
And so this is a\ntypical test layout
with patios and gangways, which\nmay have something like this
to see, in which, like I said,\nentrepreneurial activity,
educational, and\nresearch activity
exists next to\ncommercial activity.
So the project is\napproved and is now fixed
and they are already\ndoing the ground works.
And in the meantime,\nthey have an agreement
about the high\nspeed railway line.
Another little bit of a\nmega project but also not,
that's why I show it.
Also tied to this, we're\nmaking, in the city,
is the Seun project\nthat we do in Seoul.
You see on the left-hand side\nis two kilometers long building.
It's quite famous.
It is, in the meantime,\nrebaptized making city.
There are a lot of new\neconomy activities there.
And we have worked on a\ncompetition for the right area,
which is an area\nthat is completely
atomized into small plots,\ncoming from the original plot
division, and\nowned by 60 owners.
So this is the kind\nof work that you see,
but also there are very low\nprofile things happening.
And this is the next project\nthat is going to be done.
And people in the\ncity, as well as
the 60 owners of\nall these sheds,
they want to prevent that these\nkind of Samsung buildings,
like you see there, are\ngoing to dominate the city.
Actually, the whole\nof Seoul is being
Samsungized by these kind of\ngiant blocks and is, of course,
not so very nice.
So we made quite a\nradical proposal,
which, amazingly, was\naccepted, by turning
these alleys of\nthe original plots
into a pedestrian access\nsystem for the new building
configuration.
And they also had a zoning\nlaw with height limitations
because there's a tomb\nthere of some kings,
and other limitations,\nthat made the building
necessary to slope, or to\ncut off, or to tear us.
This is the famous river that\nwas freed from the highway
viaduct that maybe you all know,\nsomething like 15 years ago,
and has become one of the\nmajor public spaces in Seoul.
And on the left hand,\nyou see the area
that we are planning now.
And on the left, you\nsee the original fabric.
Then you see the current fabric.
And then you see what\nwe try to preserve,
and we cannot\npreserve the plots.
But we preserve kind of\nimagining of the plots
in the form of\nstepped roof terraces
in the different building\nelements that are
between this pedestrian space.
And we are commissioned\nby the 60 owners,
so this is not a repossession\nproject, where a big developer
kind of skims the whole thing.
But this is a project\nthat is commissioned
by the 60 proprietors\nof these different sets
in the middle slides.
So it's highly unique.
So if you go to the second\nimage top on the left,
that's the condition\nthat it has now.
And normally, you would go to\nthe left, clear everything,
and then you would go down\nand put in a couple of Samsung
volumes on top of it.
But what we do is\ngoing to the right
and, let's say, make a kind\nof scale interpretation,
and use certain reminiscence\nstructures for the urban design
and also for the architecture.
So this is the\nresult. It consists
of something like 10\nbuildings, and they will all
be elaborated by architects.
We do also one of the buildings.
It steps down towards the tomb.
It has multiple terraces.
And it has three\nlayers, which is only
viable in Asia, ground floor\nlayer, an intermediate layer,
and a top layer, where there\nare also public activities.
And the ground floor\nlayer is very interesting
because it also is\ncalled memory ground.
There's a lot of archaeological\nstuff underneath the soil,
underneath these sheds.
And we open them\nup and [inaudible],,
and so it will be\npartly a museum
where you go through\nthe ground floor.
And we orient the space\nand the articulation
of the scale and the\nelements to the alleys
that are now in that area.
And of course, funny enough,\nlike the Meerpaal in Dronten,
this is, of course, a little\nbit also coming forward
out of my history with\nthe Herman Hertzberger
and Aldo van Eyck in the TU\nDelft in the 1970s, which,
of course, worked very much\nwith this scaling in a very
structuralist way.
This is the famous\nCentral Beheer
project by Herman Hertzberger.
So what about the landscape?
This is the landscape\nin the Netherlands.
It's called Oostvaardersplassen,\nand it is an area
that is inside a polder.
So it should be parceled\ncompletely rectangular,
in the sense that Vittorio\nsaid this afternoon.
But it didn't manage because\nthe civil engineers could not
get the so-called\n[inaudible] water out.
It is water that\ngoes under the dike
and then penetrates\ninto the polder.
So it was, more or less,\nlost, and it turned
into a natural reservation.
It was appointed a\nnational reservation,
and in the meantime,\nyou can say that it
is the only prehistoric\nlandscape in the Netherlands,
which is only 50 years old,\nwhich is a nice paradox.
And on top of that,\nkonic horses were
set out there, which is\na hybrid of the top horse
from the Eastern Europe plains\nand the aurochs, but not
a real one.
A kind of re-hybrid version\nof different wild cows
were set out in this\narea, and the horses,
they were very successful.
They grew and their herd\nwas split into 2 and 1/2.
The herd was transported to\nPoland, to the east of Poland,
and set out in their\noriginal habitat.
So it's a kind of nature\nengineering, which
I think is interesting,\nin relation
to the discussions about the\nAnthropocene, which you also
addressed this afternoon.
We have, as Dutchman\nwho have been grown up
in artificial conditions,\nwe have the approach
that due to the fact that it\nis too late, that the planet is
already on its way\nto be destroyed,
we have to be also active\nin designing evolution.
Well, that was a little\nbit over the top.
We also made the\ntwo urban extensions
on the sides of this\narea, where they
manage to dry up the polder.
And then we said to\nthe mayor of this city,
oh, mayor, we do not\nbelieve that you get your,
I don't know, 5,000\nor 7,000 housing units
there with all the amenities.
It will never happen.
So we made a design\nthat consists
of a spine in the middle, along\nwith the first construction
and the amenities.
And then on the\nright-hand side, we
created an extension\nof this water area,
or this wetland area.
And on the left-hand side,\nwe created Forest Park.
And so the trick was\nthat you were allowed
to build the spine, and after\nyou had built the spine,
only on the basis to a\ncertain degree of demand
you were allowed to invade\nthe forests with dwellings
or invade the water with\nislands we build for them.
And this is one of\nthe projects that we
call inversion in urban design.
We do not take a side.
And then we start to design\nsomething nice on it.
From the volume of the\nprogram that we get,
we look at how the\nprogram fits onto a site.
We say, let's look\nat the site, then
make a diagnose\nabout the qualities,
then consolidate what we\nthink are the qualities.
Consequently, we\ntell the authorities
how much we think that\nsuch a site can have.
So it's a kind of\ninverse approach
of protecting an area,\nmore than just let it go.
Of course, this is only possible\nin certain planning conditions.
And as I was, at that\ntime, also appointed
as the chief planner of Schiphol\nAirport, Amsterdam Airport,
we also worked on the\nmaster plan in Schiphol
from that perspective, which\nled to an enormous resonance,
also, at other airports.
And then we decided to\nmake a resource in a book
called The Noise\nLandscape, where
we looked at different airport\nurbanization conditions, which
was nice for me because in the\n1980s, when I was still at OMA,
I made this collage.
You see David [inaudible]\non the left-hand--
you can see his eyes--
in a farmer costume.
And you see he has an\nAmerican Express card,
and he earns so much money with\nhis farm next to the airport
that he can fly to Concorde.
You see all the\nproduction on the horizon.
You see that he\ndoesn't have a farm,
but he has more like\na Renaissance castle
and a Renaissance garden.
In this garden are not\nflowers, but his products
as an exhibition.
You see him with his father,\nshowing a model of his farm
in Nairobi, where the\nroses are growing better.
You see that they are\ngenetically experimenting.
And you see that they\nhave guest workers
in the underground\ninfrastructure helping them
to produce their products,\nwhich are then in the Harlem
which is seven meters below\nsea level, in which Amsterdam
Airport lies, being\nshipped to the airport.
And I can tell you, the\nreality is not very different
as this caricature that I made\nin 1987 for an exhibition.
This is the Schiphol\narea, and you
see it's a beautiful landscape.
And the motorway and the railway\nland in an island by tunnels.
And so the revolving landing\nstrips are, of course,
because of the very\nmany wind directions,
the planes can freely\nmove around this node.
And you see the original\npolar structure,
let's say the subdivision\nfor agricultural use
from the 19th\ncentury, very nicely,
and also some of\nthe farm strips.
So one of the\nacknowledgments that they
made as master\nplanners was always
a fight between the city of\nAmsterdam and the airport,
or the other surrounding areas.
And until we made this drawing\nwith the consequent diagrams--
this drawing shows the\nemission of sound contours.
And here, you see what,\nin our exaggerated vision,
would have happened when\nthe airport would not
have been there.
So on the left hand, you see the\nairport and its sound contour,
which leaves a lot of space\nopen and leaves Amsterdam
free from Haarlem\nand from Hoofddorp
and Liden and other cities.
And on the right\nhand, you see what
probably might have happened\nwhen the airport would not
have been there.
And so we convinced both the\ndirection of the airport,
as well as the city\ngovernment of the surrounding
municipalities, that you should\nconsider the airport as a park
landscape and that\nyou should be glad
that you have these nice\ncontours, because it creates
a hard edge for the\ncity and it does not
lead to a sprawled condition.
And so you see here,\nthis is a student project
that we did on the\nleft, which creates
this park out of the airport.
And you see here that\nthe airport park, which
is the second from the\nleft, is about the same
as other natural reservations\naround the city of Amsterdam.
And so in the wake\nof that, we also
tendered out park\nprojects that were kind
of consolidating this notion.
So this is the\nso-called sound part
by H&S Landscape\nArchitects, which
is a [inaudible] landscape that\nhas that distributes the noise
and, at the same time, is a very\nattractive park for leisure.
Of course, also\nfor spotters that
like to look at airplanes\nbecause probably
half of the population\ndoesn't mind to live
around airplane ports at all.
One of the features\nin many airports
that we researched and we talked\nto was also the golf course.
We made a golf course in\nSchiphol between the Amsterdam
forest on the south, on the\nlower part of the slide,
and the landscape\naround the airport.
And the golf course is\nnot simply a golf course.
If you go to Incheon, Incheon\nis an enormous airport,
which has two golf courses, boat\nracing things, dentist clinics,
et cetera.
They have the problem that they\nare so far from the cities,
and they have gained so\nmuch land from the sea,
that the airport\nis almost vanishing
in the middle of nowhere\nand they are forced
to produce new functions.
And the golf courses\nthat are around airports
are initially golf courses\nthat were given to a golf club
because the land was\nnot valuable at all.
But now, Incheon, for instance,\nexploits the two golf courses.
Schiphol Airport\nexploits the golf courses
because they have noticed\nthat the golf course is
a vital economic engine\nfor entrepreneurial shape
and aviation in the\nairport urbanization
area, which, of course, is\nit's kind of a brilliant idea.
These are birch trees planted\nby Adriaan Geuze from West 8
Architects that are specially\nbreeded birch trees that have
weak, venerable branches so\nthat birds cannot sit on them.
So as soon as a bird sits\non a branch, it flips down.
So it's a landscape\ndevice that tries
to prevent to have too many\nbirds in the airport that
then do not land into\nthe engine of the plane.
And here, you see a\ninstallation in which
we are recycling de-icing\nliquid with the help of algae.
There is a department\ncalled The Grounds, founded
in Schiphol Airport, that works\non sustainable complementary
technologies to make\nthe airport more sound.
And of course, we have\nall these enormous boxes
in and around the airport.
That's the flower auction in\none of the biggest buildings
in the Netherlands.
And we are now trying to see\nhow, with the different owners
and entrepreneurs, we can use\nthese roofs for multiple use,
specifically, also, for these\nsecondary economic activities
around the airport.
And the last project, in\nthat sense, that I show you
is a railway station in\nMontpellier in France.
This is the Mediterranean.
This is city center\nof Montpellier.
And here, you see the\nsite, the neighborhood,
of the new railway station,\nwhich, of course, shouldn't be,
but in France, they just\ndeliberately let the TGV lines
past the cities and\nsometimes put a station
in between cities.
You see the TGV line that\nis going to be there.
And here, you see the\nexisting motorway.
This is a bypass motorway.
It becomes the nice separation\nof a landscape corridor
between the city\nand the villages
around the lagoon\nand the airport.
It's completely threatening\nto be destroyed,
and we were selected\nbecause we did,
let's say, a kind\nof inverse approach,
which, finally, they swallowed.
So this line is being\nbuilt, and it's my fault
that this line is there.
So I have, by drawing\nthis, destroyed
the landscape on the one hand.
But on the other hand, this\nwould be only the railway,
and there would be another\none for the highway.
And we managed to\nput them together.
It needed seven\nmonths and, finally,
sitting at the desk\nof the Ministry
of Transport, Minister\nof Transport in Paris,
to lay them cold against each\nother, by which we could create
a railway square across that\nimmediately could connect
this area and this.
Then we decided\nthat everything that
was wetlands or stream and\ncreek and vineyard, and so on,
was going to be protected.
And the end is a\ngreen framework.
The result is a green framework.
So first, we have reduced\nthe infrastructure bundle.
Secondly, we have made\nintelligent crossings for them.
We have neutralized\nthe sound problem.
We have preserved the\nqualities of the landscape.
And then the\nresidual areas are--
this is an example\nof the station.
Of course, there has been a\ncompetition in the station
not so nice as we thought.
These neighborhoods,\nthey can be built,
but they can also not be built.\nThat doesn't really matter.
We have a framework in\nwhich in different orders
of development incrementally.
One can fill it up to a\ncertain degree of relationship
between the built\nand the unbuilt.
And so we always say\nnowadays, after this project,
urban design is like skiing.
It's the art of\nbreaking elegantly.
And the instruments that\nyou have for breaking
are different\nadministrative law.
Also, the first law in\nSwitzerland, for instance,
is an enormous problem\nfor some cities.
They also have a so-called\ndisaster food service law,
which means that\nthey have to have
a minimum agricultural service\nper resident in the country
in order to feed\nself-sufficiently
in times of crisis.
And so you have\nan enormous amount
of these kind of breaking\nfactors, if you like,
that make urban\ndesign like skiing.
And this is a list I\nshowed this afternoon.
I think that is a very\ninteresting list to look at it.
Because I can now say that\ninverse landscape urbanism
is something new, but\nit's nothing new at all.
It was already in Cities in\nEvolution by Patrick Geddes.
And Rem Koolhaas showed nothing,\nthat his countryside is now
the label for\nlandscape urbanism,
because there are\nsomething like 40 concepts
and ideas before him.
The idea of being an\nurbanist, an urban designer,
is not to be a unique\ninventor of ideas.
You are a cog wheel\nin a mechanism,
and you have to find\nout where you have
where you can have\nimpact and where not.
Thank you very much.
[applause]
Stay up here.
I think we have time for\nabout 13 minutes of questions,
or something like that.
So if you want to stay up here.
Questions?
Anybody have a question?
We'll have a microphone\ngoing around.
Please.
Hi.
Good evening.
Thank you for your talk.
I want to go back to the\nmaybe one unarchitecture slide
you showed of the fleet\nversus the one ship.
Oh yeah.
And how you think of your\nwork and working together.
And I noticed what\nyou focused on a lot
in this talk were sites\nthat were rather large
and you could work\na lot in them one.
The one that seemed very unique\nwas where the owners were more
your client and not\nthe big developers,
but you seem to\nalways work and push--
as you said, develop--\nthe idea beyond kind
of at all what people think\nis possible at the outset.
My question is,\nin the future, do
you think that there is\nenough land right now that
are these kinds of defunct\nsites on city edges
and coastlines to\nredevelop into something
that could accommodate the\namount of housing and urban
and built environment that we're\ngoing to need in the future?
Or do you think\nit's a place where
you need to look to\nother smaller forms,
more atomized, more\nspread apart maybe?
And I'll leave it at\nthat vague question mark.
That's almost impossible\nto answer that question,
but let's say I can\nsay something about it.
The fleet merely is an\norganization system,
in which I have installed\nboth in the university
as in our office, in which\nI immediately give away
the finances and the men and the\ncompany management to somebody
else so that I can\nwork on the content.
And this person is\nfully responsible.
I don't even know what the\nturnover of the office is.
I have no idea.
I have a salary, and\nwhen there's a profit,
I get something of the profit.
I also have, since\ntwo years, atomized
the property of the office.
So I only still have\nsomething like 12% ownership
in my office.
It appears that people\nget more motivated when
they are co-owners, and\nwe have a good mechanism
that people who are not really\nfunctioning after a while
can also fade out again.
It's very important to\ncreate a complimentary team
and that you create\na condition in which
this complimentary team can\nthen, let's say, subdivide,
if you like.
And I think this is a\nvery important requirement
because the urban design process\nin a city like Amsterdam,
or even in Singapore,\nworks in that way.
You have multiple people who\nall have a very independent say
and you have to\nbring into harmony
their different interests,\nor you have to at least go on
with the project.
The 60 clients in Korea, they\nhave organized themselves
in a certain way like that\nby delegating the project
management to a company.
And this company has to,\nlet's say, every time produce
a presentation of\nthe design the costs
the functional differences\nin the program,
et cetera, to the 60 owners.
So they are not\nindividuals, but they
are grouped into a\nkind of collective,
and the collective\nhas a management
body that communicates with\nus and the municipality.
And now, about urban\ndevelopment, let's say,
I think there are two\nmodels of urbanization
beyond the countryside.
The first is the compact city.
And of course, you can see that\neven mega cities in developing
countries, they are partly\nextremely unsustainable,
but at the same time, they have\na very low takeoff footprint.
And in general,\nfor all cities, you
can say that agglomeration\nleads to a better condition.
Also an economic sense.
If you read the\nbook Arrival Cities,
you know that after two\nor three generations,
people from the cities\nin the slums already
mostly have emancipated\ninto official society.
And then the second--
I always say in terms\nof concentration,
and attraction of concentration,\nand settling of forces,
and so on, the large city is,\nmore or less, on autopilot.
Of course, we have\nto govern them.
We have to improve them.
But let's say that's\nan autopilot process.
And then we have\nwhatever you call it,
the last slide, the\nurbanized landscape.
And the urbanized landscape--
houses maybe as many people\nas in all the cities--
I don't know.
I mean, I'm not a statistic.
But you could maybe say that\nif you look at the world
population map, you see\nthat the area in Java,
or along the Ganges, are\ncompletely populated,
the whole area\nsouth of Shanghai.
And if you look at the\nworld rice production map,
you see, more or less, the same.
So those areas are producing\nmost of the agriculture
production, and at the same time\nare the most populated areas.
So maybe half of the\nso-called urban people,
according to the UN report,\nare living in those areas.
Those areas are\noriginally rural,
but they are increasingly\nbecoming productive landscape.
Also because they\nhouse industry.
Think of all the\nmemory stick factories
along the river in Bangkok,\nand I don't know what.
So they become really\nindustrialized,
agriculturized,\nand also settled.
And they produce an\nenormous amount of mobility
and they get a proliferation\nof infrastructure.
So now the question is, is that\na future model of urbanization
that we should take seriously?
Or is it an intermediate\nstage in the full organization
of such a whole area?
And what does that mean?
You cannot now say I will\nmake a concept for that,
or I have an idea for that.
This is a kind of mixture\nbetween natural development,
between prosperity, between\nthe quality of governance,
et cetera, et cetera.
So thank you for your talk.
Though I don't study\nurban planning,
I do have a vested\ninterest in it.
So I was curious in the\ndevelopment of Schiphol
as an airport.
If the development\nof the runways,
for example, the\nPolderbaan and the fact
that it's so far away\nfrom the center terminal,
if the development of the\nrunways at the airport
substantially affected your\nplanning of the development.
There is one runway which is\ncalled the polder runway, which
lies is something\nlike six or seven
kilometers from the terminal.
So once a pilot made the\nremark when we landed,
ladies and gentlemen,\nwe have landed somewhere
between Zurich and Amsterdam\nand we are continuing our travel
on wheels.
That's a good question.
It is there because\nexactly of this kind
of negotiating\nmoment, where to lay
the runway in order not to\naffect houses and urban area.
So normally, it would\nhave been much closer,
but this was the only area\nwhere the degree of people that
would be affected by\nnoise and emissions
and by the calamity\nlegislation would be minimum.
And so this corridor\nstays free and is,
on this moment, in the\nprocess of creating
an edge of recreational sport\nfacilities, and creating, also,
quite a nice edge condition\nof urban area around it.
Yeah, quite OK.
I think we're going to\ntry to wrap it up here.
Many of the people\ninvolved in the conference
and been here all day\nand it's been a long day.
But I'd like to take one--
exploit my role here and\njust make one comment
about your the penultimate\nanswer to the question
about where are we going\nto fit all these people.
And your response, putting the\nidea of an urbanized landscape
on the table, I think is a\nvery powerful and important one
for us here at the GSD.
I'm sorry Charles is not here.
He was around this morning.
There are a lot of\nconcepts floating around.
There's landscape urbanism,\nurbanism as a landscape,
ecological urbanism.
I hear or read your phrasing\nof the issue urbanize landscape
in a very different way, as\nreally putting the built form
that we have associated\nwith cities out
in spaces that\nwere not associated
with cities, rural areas.
But they will become\nurbanized in the process,
and it's a different\nway of thinking
about the combination\nof landscape
architecture, urban planning,\nand urban design, I believe.
So next time you come\nback, maybe we'll
use that as the jumping off\npoint for a conversation,
because I do think\nthere's a paradigm
shift in that concept that\nhas implications for how we
organize our programs\nand our work,
and I think it's\nextremely important.
So thank you so\nmuch for leaving us
with that provocative\nphrase, and let's offer
another round of applause.
