Hi, good evening.
We're actually going\nto get started.
More or less on time,\nwhich is shocking.
I'm very pleased to host another\nevent in a series of lectures
and conversations\nhosted by the master
in his own engineering\nprogram, which, as you know,
is a collaborative\nendeavor between the GSD
and the Paulson School of\nEngineering and Applied
Science.
We are thrilled to have\nHarry West here tonight.
And I will introduce\nhim in a moment.
Let me just take a\nminute, initially,
to trace very briefly the\nhistory of a company that
has had a decisive\ninfluence in shaping many
of the early\ninteractions we've had
with various forms of\ntechnology from music
tapes to personal computers.
The history of frog is\nsomewhat representative
of the profound changes that\nthe field of product design
has undergone, from giving\nshape to functions and needs
to system-based\nconsultancy and strategy.
The formation of frog actually\ndates back indirectly to 1969--
most of you were not\naround then, I think--
when Hartmut Esslinger found\nEsslinger Design in the Black
Forest area in Germany.
The company was a\nproduct design company
in the traditional sense,\ngiving shape to products,
and excelled really in the\nconsumer electronics area.
The Sony Walkman was one of\nthe early signature products.
After meeting with\nSteve Jobs, the company
eventually relocated\nto California,
renamed itself of\nfrog design in 1984.
Now also working\nfor Apple oversea,
the early designs for\nthe Macintosh computers
were produced by frog design.
These early McIntosh\ncomputers are now
part of a permanent collection\nof the Whitney Museum of Art.
It was finally in 2005 that\nthe current company of frog
was formed, and Harry West\nhas been its CEO since 2015.
frog today focuses on\nglobal design and innovation
with an emphasis on user\nexperience in industries,
such as financial services;\ntelecommunications;
health care; enterprise\nsoftware; mobility;
financial services; I\nactually said already,
government services\nand consumer products.
Harry leads a talented group\nof designers, strategists,
researchers, technologists,\nand program managers
who strive to improve the\ndaily experiences of people
around the world.
Harry has degrees in engineering\nfrom Cambridge University,
in technology and\npolicy from MIT,
and a PhD in robotics\nfrom MIT as well.
He has led design and innovation\nat MIT, Continuum, and Prophet
before joining frog.
He's no stranger to the GSD.
He's been active on the external\nadvisory board of the NDE
Program.
He lives locally, and each week,\nworks from a different frog
studio in San Francisco, Austin,\nNew York, Boston, London,
Milano, Munich, and Shanghai.
He's flying out\ntomorrow, so we're
happy to have you here today.
And without much further ado,\nplease welcome Harry West.
[applause]
Thank you, Martin.
Very honored to be here.
I look forward to talking with\nyou for the next few quarters,
an hour or so about design,\nAI, and customer experience.
Servant or Svengali?
That is the question.
I do not know the answer, but\nI will share some thoughts
around that.
Please feel free to interrupt.
I'm told that you won't,\nbut I'm going to ask anyway.
So we are living in\nthe age of experiences,
magical experiences.
And I think that\nthis image captures
that sense of awe in her\nface, that little girl's face,
because she is about to meet\na princess or somebody who
knows a princess.
And this is the\nmoment that she's
been dreaming of for years.
And that princess\nknows her name,
and she is going to greet\nher by name on her birthday.
And that is a\nmemory that's going
to live with her for\nthe rest of her life.
Now that is all facilitated\nby its interesting technology
right there on\nher wrist that you
didn't notice until\nI pointed it out;
that enables Disney\nto know who she is
and to track her throughout\nDisney World and her parents;
and for Disney to let\nher in without hindrance
into this magical world; and for\nthe princess or the person who
knows the princess\nto greet her by name.
And that's magic.
And for that magic, her parents\nhave saved up for many years,
probably, to give\nthat their daughter
this extraordinary experience.
And the experience is going\nbe so wonderful for her
that they're going to try to\nsave up again to bring her back
next year.
And even if they don't\ndo that, their daughter
will remember this for\nthe rest of her life.
And when she has\nchildren, she will
want to bring them\nback to Disney World
as well to share that experience\nthat she remembers so fondly
from her childhood.
This is the age of experience.
Now, not all of us every day\nexperience something quite as
magical as that.
Or, we're not aware of it\nas we're experiencing it.
But in fact, every day-- in\nfact, I can see some of you
in the audience right\nnow using technology
in a very magical way.
And we're so oblivious to that.
We're so used to that.
And every day, we're enjoying\nthe products and services
of the companies\nthat we buy from.
And those experiences\nare extraordinary.
How did this happen?
Technology and design.
I think that probably the\nmost important technology
that most of us don't pay\nany attention to anymore
is the internet.
And when that became\npublic in around 1993
with the launch of Mosaic,\nthat unleashed the possibility
for the experiences that\nwe're enjoying today.
That was followed\nshortly thereafter
by the mobile phone and\nmobile communication.
It has changed a lot since then.
But this came out\naround 1999 and was
the first mobile communication\ntechnology or smart phone.
And then, followed\nquickly around 2002
by the first social\nnetwork, Friendster--
still big in\nMalaysia, I believe.
And that unleashed a revolution.
Because with the\npower of the internet
and mobile phones\nand social networks,
our opinions as\nindividual consumers
mattered more than ever.
And with a tweet, we\ncould bring down a brand.
Or with a tweet, we could\neven bring down a candidate,
as it's happening today.
And so, what happened was\nthat instead of the consumer
rotating around\nthe enterprise, we
went through a\nCopernican revolution.
And the enterprise began to\nrotate around the consumer
because each\nindividual consumer has
a power of communicating\nthrough social networks
with every other consumer.
And that opinion matters.
And it's that collective\nvoice of all of us
that determines the fate of\ncompanies, large and small.
And so, that today,\nevery company
is determined to deliver the\nvery best possible customer
experience.
Their future, their very\nexistence, depends on it.
And this is the revolution that\nhas happened over the last 20
years or so during our lifetime.
And so, today, we experience\nthese extraordinarily high
quality products and services.
And I'll just go through\nsome obvious examples
of extraordinary high quality,\nlike the BMW automobile
or your iPhone.
Or for some of us, for some\npeople, their automobile
insurance company--
extraordinarily high quality\nand a highly rated customer
experience.
On Netflix, how we\nchoose our movies.
Almost every product and\nservice that we interact
with today, the experience\nhas been very painstakingly
designed for our delight.
We are all like that little\ngirl greeting the princess.
These companies know\nus by name often,
and they've designed the\nexperience around us.
And we love it,\nand we pay for it.
And if we're ever disappointed,\nwe let everybody know.
And then, a new\ntechnology came along.
And I think that the first\npaper around deep learning
and backpropagation\ncame around 2006.
And that is just beginning\nto unleash a new revolution.
And we don't really know\nwhere that is going.
And so, what I want to do\ntoday is explore with you
where the revolution\nof AI and design
is going to take us, and think\nabout what good can come of it
and what traps there\nmay lie in our future.
So that's the question\nthat we want to address.
And before I do that,\nI'm going to share
a little bit about\nfrog because I would
like to show you some pictures\nabout some of the work
we have done.
Because I'm so proud of the\ncompany that I work for.
So, frog.
Rumor has it that frog stands\nfor Federal Republic of Germany
because Hartmut\ncame from Germany.
I don't know if\nthat's really true.
And Hartmut has\nsome other stories,
which I will not relay today.
But frog is in the business of\nadvancing the human experience.
We design customer experiences,\nand we're constantly
looking for ways to\nadvance those experiences,
to make them even\nbetter for people.
We started, as Martin described,\nback in the early '80s
when Steve Jobs was looking for\nthe best designer in the world
and found Hartmut\nEsslinger, and said,
Hartmut, I need you to\ndesign my computers.
And Hartmut said,\nSteve, I will do that.
But I will not work for you--
which is why he moved\nhis company to California
and set up right\nnext door to Apple
and designed most of Apple's\ncomputers in the early years,
including the first Macs, the\nApple 2 that is shown here.
And what you see\nhere is a revolution
because it is leading a company\nthrough a transformation
enabled by new technology and\nchanging customer expectations.
It's a revolution\nbecause she is smiling.
She is filled with happiness\nas she uses her computer.
Until this time, computers\nwere primarily work-related.
They were industrial products\nor military products.
And Steve Jobs and\nothers had the vision
to transform an industry from\nbeing a business to a consumer
product industry.
And as a result,\nit's now, perhaps,
the most valuable\ncompany in the world.
Technology is really not\nthat easily distinguishable
from magic.
And magic makes us\nsmile, whether it's
the computer or the experience\nthat this little boy.
Because boys like to\ngo to Disney World too,
being greeted by Mickey Mouse.
And the challenge today is\nhow do we deliver a better
experience for customers?
And the economic\nadvantage is in being
able to deliver that\nexperience in a way that
is cost effective.
So this is recent\nwork that we've just
launched or helped\nIkea launch, which
is their new line\nof smart lighting.
Smart lighting has existed\nfor several years now.
But the challenge was how to\nmake it so simple and seamless
that anybody could use\nit; and so low cost
that, as Ikea talks\nabout it, it is
designed for the many people.
So that anybody can use\nit in a Western society.
It's low cost.
It is very simple.
It is very secure.
It is lighting for anybody.
And of course, the measure of\nhow well you're doing today
is the Net Promoter Score.
And I trust that everybody here\nis familiar with Net Promoter
Score.
That is the ultimate\nmeasure for how good
your customer experience is.
And senior executives today are\nliving in fear of this score
because their compensation or\ntheir future in the company
will depend on how well they're\ndoing on their Net Promoter
Score.
It's a measure of, are your\ncustomers willing to promote
or say they will\npromote your product,
your brand, your\ncompany to other people?
If that is high, your\ncompany will grow.
If it is low, you'll\nprobably go out of business.
So the Net Promoter\nScore is super important.
And this is a service that we\ndesigned with Saudi Telecom
in Saudi Arabia.
It's called Jawwy.
It's a new telecom service.
And apparently,\naccording to the CEO,
it's now got the highest Net\nPromoter Score of any telecom
provider in the world.
So we're super proud of that.
And what Jawwy is\nan example of is
how design mediates technology.
Because what's on that\nscreen shown in the top right
is only possible\nbecause the technology--
the, about, 10 or 11\ntechnology providers
that are enabling that\nto appear on the screen.
And what design is doing, as\nshown in that orange layer
beneath the products,\nis we are mediating.
We're coordinating.
We're channeling all\nof that technology
so that that woman\nlooking at her phone
gets a single unified experience\nof all of those technologies.
And that's what makes\nit work for her.
So that's frog.
And we're about 400\npeople globally.
We're in these studios\nacross the world--
North America,\nEurope, India, China.
And now let's talk a little\nbit about the power of design.
Hartmut Eslinger talked\nabout form follows emotion.
That was a response to\nform follows function.
And Hartmut recognized\nthat it was in motion.
That was the goal of design.
Our job is to seduce.
That's what we do.
We are licensed to seduce.
We design, we create products\nand services that you want.
And there is, I'm\nsure, people here
who are lusting after the latest\niPhone, which we had nothing
to do with, but which\nfollows in the heritage
that frog and Hartmut helped\nto create some 40 years ago.
So design can seduce,\nand that that's
why we get paid to do our jobs.
That is my job.
Our job is to create good design\nthat improves our customers'
experience, that\nshape their behavior,
so that the business\nthat paid us grows.
It's mercantile.
It's commercial.
But that's the\nbusiness that we're in.
That is the business of design.
And design's reach\nhas spread very far.
If we go back 40 years, we were\ndesigning things like this--
objects.
And that was the\nprimary role of design.
Today, design has moved\nto the far top right hand
corner of my graph.
And we're designing systems\nof things, or experiences.
We've gone from designing\ndiscrete products to systems
of brand, product, and\nservices; and then also building
the capabilities\nwithin the enterprise
to continue their\ndesign and development.
That's the role of design today.
And one way to\nthink about that is
to think that, ultimately, we're\ndesigning customer experience.
And back when Hartmut was\ndesigning the original Mac,
he was designing the\ncustom experience
of a discrete product.
Today, we're designing\nthe customer experience
of an entire company.
And by customer experience, we\nmean all of the interactions
and impressions that people\nhave with an organization
over time--
shaping their opinions and\nin turn, the economic value
of the brand.
And those interactions can be\nthrough many different touch
points-- through web, through\nmobile, through in-store,
through call centers,\nthrough physical products,
through buildings,\nthrough spaces,
all of the interactions\nwith the brand.
And those impressions can\nbe deliberately designed.
Buy the product.
But more often today,\nlet's think back
to that social network,\nthe mobile phone.
More often today,\nthose impressions
come from friends and families\nand anecdotes from colleagues,
from earned and\nunearned media, and PR.
That's where we hear about the\nproducts and services today--
from our Facebook\nwall, from our feed.
That's what tells us what our\nfriends are talking about.
And often, we care\nabout the feedback
we're getting beyond\nthe moment of purchase,
but throughout the ownership\nand consumption of that product.
That's the customer experience.
And that's what we have to\ndesign so that people love
using it, so that\npeople recommend it,
so that you go back\nand buy it again,
and so that your\nfriends buy it too.
That's what we do.
Now AI adds a new dimension\nto customer experience.
And that's what we\nwant to talk about.
AI enables\nmulti-dimensional design.
Let me explain.
So, here's a design for a\ndigital experience for AI,
which is a large insurance\ncompany, particularly in Asia.
And we have helped\nto lead them through
a digital transformation.
And when you look at that\nscreen, we have x and y.
And that changes over time.
But today, there is a new access\nin design, and that's you.
And by you, I mean you.
So, what's happening is that\nscreen knows who you are.
And they know a lot about you.
They know your demographics.
They know how you\nare interacting
with the screen in the moment.
They know, based on\nhistory, how people
like you are going to\nbehave in the future.
And they can use that knowledge\nto make your experience better
and to guide you in\ncertain directions.
So we look at AI as\na tool that designers
use to make the\nexperience of customers
even more convenient, even more\nseamless, even more emotionally
connecting.
It's great.
Why would you not\nwant to do that?
And here some three simple\nways that we can use
AI in our design.
We can use AI to develop\nnew ways to interact.
We can interact easily today\nthrough speech or text,
for example.
And AI can help us to understand\nor help a machine to understand
what that speech or text means.
We can simplify the experience\nby anticipating what
is going to be easier for you.
So we can make\njudgments on the fly.
I say, we, I mean, the machine\ncan make judgments on the fly
as to what is going to be easier\nfor you to navigate and offer
those up for you.
We can make things\nmore relevant.
And again, I say we, I\nmean the machine can make
things more relevant to you.
But optimizing the offers by\nenticing you with things by
offers that you are\nmore likely to buy.
And all of this will\nhappen seamlessly.
And generally, you're not\naware that it's happening.
And it's been enabled by that\nclever algorithm that was first
written about in 2006.
Because suddenly, once we\nintroduce deep learning,
then the ability to recognize\nspeech, for example,
went from a high error rate to\na very much lower error rate.
So suddenly, speech\nrecognition became practical.
It was a breakthrough.
It was unanticipated.
It was a surprise\nthat it worked well.
And it continues to surprise\nus that it works it well.
But it does.
And so, this leads to all\nsorts of possibilities.
And I'm not going to show\nyou any current clock client
work, because that would\nviolate some confidentiality.
So I'm going to show\nyou some examples
that different frogs in\nour different studios
around the world have\ncreated to demonstrate
what they're working on\nin a more abstract way.
So we can create systems\nfor conversational health.
We can streamline access\nto complex services
and support with flows as simple\nas just using a WhatsApp chat.
And so, this can be our health\ncare experience in the future.
Or at least, how we\naccess health insurance,
perhaps, or our car insurance.
And so you're having a\nconversation with a device.
And the device understands you\nbecause it understands text
and it anticipates your needs.
And then it offers you\nthings that it thinks
will be more attractive to you.
And it's fun and simple to use.
And there you go.
You just bought\nitself some insurance.
Here's an example\nthat we have worked on
with a financial\nservice company.
The financial service\ncompany discovered
that people were leaving their\nwebsite before they completed
a transaction, and that\nwas a problem for them.
It was partly a problem\nbecause they weren't completing
the transaction,\nbut it was mainly
a problem because of\ntheir next action, which
was to pick up the phone\nand call customer service.
And customer service\nis very expensive.
So they asked us to look at ways\nthat we could improve that--
make it easier for the\nconsumer, for the customer--
and also reduce their\ncosts by having less load
on their customer service lines.
So this is a very simple model.
There's questions\naround allocation.
If you have investments,\nyou may want
to think about how you're\ngoing to allocate money.
There's questions\naround transfers--
how you're going to transfer\nmoney from one fund to another.
And questions around\nrebalancing-- how
are you going to\nrebalance your fund.
And for those of you with\n401(k)s or investments,
you are probably familiar\nwith these challenges.
What we discovered was that\ncustomers were getting partway
through one of these operations,\nand then they were giving up.
It was too difficult for them.
Or they weren't quite\nsure what to do,
and they were phoning\ncustomer service.
And we looked into it.
And we discovered, using\na deep learning network,
that we could\ncharacterize the behavior
of different customers.
And then we could,\non the fly, modify
the web experience,\nthe online experience,
to make it easier for them.
