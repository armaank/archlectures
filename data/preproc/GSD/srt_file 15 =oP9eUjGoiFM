Hi, everyone.
Thanks for coming.
So tonight's lecture\nmarks the conclusion
of women and designs\nevents celebrating
International Women's Day.
The focus has been\nfeminine power
sidestepping the normative\nassumptions about what
success and agency look like\nwithin the design fields
and instead searching\nfor alternative ways
to understand power.
Events circled\naround three themes--
feminist epistemologies\nin design,
foreground women's\nwork, and workshopping
emergent practices.
We strove together members\nfrom our own GSD community
to celebrate and cultivate\nnew ways of thinking
about gender and power.
Tonight's lecture\nis no exception.
Women in Design is\ndelighted to welcome
Beatrice Colomina to our school\nas the concluding keynote
speaker.
Beatrice is professor\nof history and theory
in the School of Architecture\nand founding director
of the program in\nMedia and Modernity
at Princeton University.
She has written extensively on\nquestions of architecture, art,
sexuality, and media.
Her books include\nAre We Human, Notes
on an Archeology of\nDesign, i Century
of the Bed, Manifesto\nArchitecture-- the Ghost
of Mies, Clip Stamp, Fold,\nDomesticity at War, Privacy
and Publicity, Modern\nArchitecture's Mass Media,
and Sexuality and Space.
She has curated a number\nof exhibitions including
Clip Stamp Fold in 2006,\nPlayboy Architecture in 2012,
and Radical Pedagogies in 2014.
She was curator with Mike\nQuigley of the third Istanbul
Design biennial in 2016.
She has been the recipient of\ndiverse awards and fellowships
including the Samuel\nH Cress Senior
Fellowship at the Center for\nAdvanced Studies in the Visual
Arts, SOM Foundation, La\nCorbusier Foundation, Grant
Foundation, the Canadian\nCenter for Architecture,
the American Academy in\nBerlin, and the Getty
Center in Los Angeles.
Tonight we welcome\nher as an authority
on gender and sexuality\nin the built environment.
Some of the seeds of today's\nintense and immersive
conversations,\nespecially in the GSD,
can be found in her\nwork, particularly
Sexuality and Space from 1992.
I would have loved to have\ngone to the conference,
but I was three, and of\nwhich she was the editor.
In it, we can learn that\nthe politics of space
are always sexual.
Architecture must be thought of\nas a system of representation
in the same way that we think of\ndrawings, photographs, models,
film, or television, not\nonly because architecture
is made available to\nus through the media,
but because the built\nobject is itself
a system of representation.
Likewise the body\nhas to be understood
as a political construct,\na product of such systems
of representation rather than\nthe means by which we encounter
them.
We here now find our\ninterests and intentions
in this particular\nmoment shifting.
We accept that architecture\nis a system of representation
but of whom and by whom.
We accept the body as\ninherently political,
but who's calling\nthe shots here?
We pull back the veil\nto shift our gaze
from architecture as object\nto architecture as practice.
Tonight's lecturer is\nframed thusly with and not
and is the way in\nwhich women are usually
credited alongside men\nin the official records
if they're credited at all.
Women are the ghosts\nof modern architecture,
everywhere present crucial,\nbut strangely invisible.
Architecture is\ndeeply collaborative,
more like movie making than\ntraditional visual art.
But unlike movies, this is\nhardly ever acknowledged.
Until recently, it's been\na secret carefully guarded.
So tonight, we make\nspace to represent
that which has been\npreviously rendered invisible.
Please welcome\nBeatrice Colomina.
Thank you very much for\nyour generous introduction
and for your invitation.
It makes me really, really happy\nto be invited here precisely
by the women in design.
Not that Harvard has ever\nbeen not generous to me.
One of the first lectures--
I was just mentioning--
this I gave it here when\nI was absolutely nobody.
And not that I'm anybody now,\nbut I was absolutely nobody,
like totally a kid\nin '86 I think.
I started to work\non my dissertation.
I gave three lectures\nhere in this very room.
They're very much the beginning\nof my thinking of what
could become\nprivately and publicly
the modern architecture\nmass media.
And even if I didn't have the\ntitle or anything like that,
I did, but I have always enjoyed\ncoming here and discussing
things with you.
So the question of\ncollaboration, of course,
has become I think\nan increasingly
important and urgent,\nyou can say, question.
On the one hand, you\ncan say that it's
central to contemporary\ndiscussions in general
of architecture.
If you want ever deeper\nengagement with SEER software
programs that allow\na large number
of people in different\nlocations and disciplines
to work together on\nthe same project.
On the other hand,\nI think it's also
crucial to historians\ntrying to understand
the way in which architecture\nhas been traditionally
produced.
Architecture is increasingly\na collaborative field.
We all know that,\nand yet it has been
very difficult to acknowledge\nthis simple fact to architects.
It's much more\ndifficult than Phil.
Phil has always\nrecognized these.
Why are we so stuck\nup with this question?
At the end of a film, you\nhave-- even the makeup people,
the hair people, the\ncatering people are credited.
And we credit nobody.
I mean, we were out of their way\nto credit just one person even
in situations\nlike, for example--
and this is pertinent to the\nwomen in design in Harvard
that they started that famous\nand really urgent petition
to acknowledge Denise Scott\nBrown as part of the Pritzker
Prize.
And it was still denied.
How is it possible that an\narchitectural firm acknowledge
in their name Denise Scott\nBrown and institution
has said the Pritzker Prize\ndecided that that's irrelevant.
And this is I think\nsome of the things
that we need to think about.
And precisely I was going\nto start with this question
that you just read the\nparagraph of how women
in architecture and in general--
this is an alternative title--
the with and without you, the\ngrowth of modern architecture.
Because in fact with and not and\nis precisely the way in which
women architects\nare more frequently
credited alongside men\nin the official records.
And that is if they\nare credited at all.
And this is a woman\nbuilder in 903
repairing the roof of\nthe city hall in Berlin.
So women had been\nin architecture
for a very, very long time.
It's just we don't see them.
In that sense, I say\nthat women are the ghosts
of modern architecture.
Here is a ghost for example.
This is photograph of\nthe Barcelona Pavilion
There are very few\nphotographs of the Pavilion.
Has anybody bothered\nto ask themselves,
who is this woman standing at\nthe edge of the carpet looking
into the Barcelona Pavilion.
Of course it's Lily Reich,\nthat not only collaborated
with Mies van der\nRohe in the pavilion,
but she was the one that was\nthere the whole time where
he kept going to Berlin.
And so, she's not only that.
She did more than 23 exhibitions\nin industrial exhibitions seen
in Barcelona at the\nsame time that they
did they the pavilion--\na fantastic exhibit
and she was crucial to\nthe Barcelona Pavilion.
But we still continue to\nsay about Barcelona Pavilion
of Mies van der Rohe of course.
And the pavilion has\nnot been inaugurated,
and she's inspecting the setup.
So women are the ghosts\nof modern architecture.
This is a self portrait\nof a Lotte Beese.
And this is a photograph of Otti\nBerger, a Bauhaus student who
actually dying at\na concentration
camp and a photograph\nof Lotte Beese.
Also, we don't know enough\nabout all these women
that were part of the Bauhaus.
And when the Bauhaus, the tragic\nstories of many of these--
all these remains to be undone.
But returning to the\nquestion of the ghost--
and I guess I put this picture\nbecause it suggests this idea
of the ghosts because women\nare really the ghost of modern
architecture--
everywhere pressing, crucial,\nbut strangely invisible,
unacknowledged.
I think they are destined\nto haunt the field forever.
But correcting the record\nis not just a question
of adding a few names\nor even thousands
to the history of architecture.
It's not just a matter of human\njustice or historical accuracy,
but a way to more fully\nunderstand architecture
and the complex ways in\nwhich it is produced.
Architecture is\ndeeply collaborative,
more like movie making than\nvisual arts for example
but unlike all traditional\nvisual arts at least.
But unlike movies, this is\nhardly ever acknowledged.
Until recently it has been\na secret carefully guarded.
So I guess what I'm conjuring\nis this idea that we are going
to get very far by simply adding\nwomen architects to the history
of modern architecture.
What do we have to\nrethink fundamentally
is the question of how\narchitecture is being produced
and the privileging\nof one single figure
that we continue to--
to [inaudible] our problem.
That's what I'm trying to say.
I'm not saying that\nit's not important to do
a specific exercise of women\nthat has not been acknowledged.
I'm just saying with this,\nwe will not get very far.
To better understand the\nfield of architecture,
I think we liberate\nnew potential.
The gap between the\nwords and and with,
which as you will see,\ninstitutions so vigilantly
guard, needs to be rethought.
With implies a helper, a\nsecondary source of energy,
and implies partnerships\nand equality.
What is positive\nabout the and is
that it feeds on\ndifference and complexity
and may encourage more and may\nencourage more nuanced forms
of production and discourse.
And I will tell\nyou a story of how
I got into this whole\nquestion of the collaboration.
It's almost 20 years\nago, and I was invited
to give a lecturer in Madrid.
And by the way,\nMadrid is incidentally
the place where I was--
the city where I was born.
It was kind of an\ninteresting occasion
because, by then,\nas I was already
a professor at Princeton, I have\nlectured everywhere-- at Yale,
at Harvard, at Princeton, etc.
at the [inaudible].
I don't know.
But you know, you never are\nanybody in your own country.
So finally, they decided that\nmaybe I was worth their while.
And the Colegio de\nArquitectos, which
is very much a male kind\nof completion institute,
and they invited me to\ngive a lecture there.
And I was working at that time.
So for those of you\nwho know my work--
not that it's way in my career--
I was working on Charles\nand Ray Eames at the time.
So I gave this lecture on the\nwork of Charles and Ray Eames,
and particularly I was\nworking on the Eames House.
And to my surprise, most of\nthe discussion at the dinner
afterwards centered on the\nrole of Ray's background
as a painter, how he\nstudies with Hans Hofmann.
They knew everything.
So of course, I\nhave mentioned, when
I was showing\nimages of the house,
how the Hans Hofmann paintings\nwere hanging horizontally
from the ceiling and how Ray\nhad a study with Hans Hofmann.
But otherwise, I had not really\nfocused on the role of Ray.
I had not brought up\nto this theme at all.
And I was also surprised that\nthey brought this question,
that they were so interested\nin the significance of Ray
in the partnership because I\nwas surrounded by very, very
well-known Spanish\narchitects, some of whom
even teach around here.
But they were all men.
There was not even a woman\non the table and also,
because as I say,\nI had not brought
the subject of\nRay's contribution
at all in the lecture.
I had thought it was not\na climate or an interest
or an audience for that kind\nof topic in Spain at that time.
The conversation\ndrifted as usually
happens in this occasion.
And before we know, we are\ntalking about Lily Reich
and what enormous,\nmassive roles she
might have played in\ndevelopment of Mies van
der Rohe's architecture.
They were saying\nabout the importance
of such products of the\nSilk and Velvet Cafe
in Berlin, the collaborative\nproject of Mies
with Lily Reich for\nthe Exposicion de la
Mode in Berlin in 1927, when\ndraperies in velvet and silk
hang from metal rods\nto form the space.
And everyone, to my surprise,\nagreed that there was nothing,
nothing in Mies work previous\nto that collaboration
with Lily Reich that will\nsuggest this radical definition
of a space, by,\nlet's say, suspended
surfaces, which\ncould become actually
his trademark, as exemplified\nof course in the Tugendhat
and the Barcelona\nPavilion of 1929.
Of course, Stoney's\nbecause where
I have always thought\nthat was obvious,
I had never brought myself--
I mean, I have said things\nlike these in seminars,
but I have never brought myself\nto write something like that,
that they were also aware\nof this incredible influence
of Lily Reich.
And then one these famous\narchitects say something that
has stayed with me ever since.
He says it is like a\ndirty little secret
that we-- that is, we,\nmeaning all architects-- keep,
something that we all\nknow, that we all see,
but we don't bring\nourselves to talk about it.
That's amazing.
So these guys are all\nguys, are controlling
the entire situation in Spain,\nthe schools of architecture,
the institute--\nthey know, they see,
they are in a kind of\nspontaneous situation
after dinner, able\nto talk about it.
But as he himself\nadmitted-- and I
thought it was really beautiful\nthat he will say it that way--
that this is like a little,\ndirty secret that we all know,
that we all see.
So in fact, that made me\nthink that the secrets
of modern architecture\nare really
like the secrets of a\nfamily, in which, of course,
everybody knows that\nsomething has happened,
but nobody wants to talk about\nit, all this little secret.
And it is perhaps because of\nour current culture fascination
with exposing the intimate,\nthat these secrets have not
been unveiled little by little.
They wanted to adjust the\npublication of recent years
or even of recent days.
There is an increasing\ninterest on the way
in which architectural\nworks, so to speak.
It is as if we have become\nmore concerned with the
how than with the what.
And how is less about structure\nor building techniques,
which was of course the\ninterest of an earlier
generation of\nhistorians, and more
about interpersonal relations.
The previous marginal details\nof how things actually
happen in architecture practice\nare now coming into the light.
The focus is shifting from the\narchitect as a single figure
and the building as an object to\narchitecture as collaboration.
This for example is Charles\nEames with John Entenza.
But how can anybody think about\nCharles Eames and his Eames
House without thinking\nabout Entenza, that was,
of course the great\npromoter of all the cases
studies in California?
So collaborations are\nmultiple and complex.
Attention is today\nstarting to be
paid to all professionals that\nare involved in the project--
the partners, the engineers,\nthe landscape architects,
the interior designers, the\nemployees, the builders, etc.,
even photographers, graphic\ndesigners, critiques, curators.
He's more of a\ncurator than a critic.
And all of those who produce\nthe work in the media
are being considered.
It's no longer\npossible to ignore
how much modern architecture\nis produced both in the media
and as media.
And these, of course, are\nthe famous photographs
of Julius Shulman of the Richard\nNeutra House on Palmer Street,
or the Pierre Koenig house.
Without these pictures,\nthe work will not exist.
As Richard Neutra himself said\nabout his photographer Julius
Shulman and Julius\nShulman, he was a kid
when Richard Neutra hired him.
He was a fashion photographer.
He had no idea how to\nphotograph architecture.
He trained him.
But then he says, this work\nwill always survive me.
Film is stronger,\nand glossy prints
are easier to see than brute\nconcrete, stainless steel,
or even ideas.
So he acknowledged the\nsignificance of this work.
Today, even the clients,\nwho were previously
treated as a problem for\narchitecture or as witness
to the effects of architecture,\nare being considered
as the active collaborators.
They are, as for example, in\nFarnsworth, the famous doctor
in Chicago and client of the\nFarnsworth House of Mies.
So of course, many of the\nbest work of architecture
owe their strength\nto the client.
And this is something\nthat, of course,
Alice Friedman\nstudied very well.
The post-war inaugurated\na new kind of-- here
you have, for example,\nAlice in the office of Mies
actively working with\nMairon Goldschmitt
in the design of her own House.
The post-war period\ninaugurated a new kind
of collaborative practice\nthat has become increasingly
difficult to ignore\nor to subsumed
between a heroic conception\nof an individual figure.
MOMA, for example, held this\nexhibition on the Chiga firm,
SOM--
Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill--
in 1950 acknowledging\nhim for the first time
a corporate office.
So here we have\nindividuals giving way
to a more anonymous collective,\neven in the exhibition of 1950.
But when finally\nthe names are put--
this is the cover\nof the catalog--
when the names are\nfinally written,
then symptomatically a\nvery significant woman
in the firm, Natalie de Blois,\nwas systematically left out.
So when they have to\nput all the names,
all the male names appear,\nbut Natalie de Blois,
who was actually\nthe great architect
of all these projects--\nthe LeBer House,
the Pepsi Build, the Hilton\nInternational in Istanbul,
she is never acknowledged to the\npoint that, at a certain point,
she left the firm.
She was never\npromoted, et cetera.
I brought this Fortune\nmagazine because I
think we are worse\narchitects, as the institution
of architecture are worse\nthan the popular press
because here you see\nFortune magazine that
has no trouble acknowledging\nthat Natalia de Blois is
the senior designer that\ndid the preliminary drawings
for the Union Carbide\nTower, et cetera.
And here she is with Phillip\nJohnson and Mario Salvadori.
And you see that Phillip\nJohnson knows perfectly well who
she's dealing with.
But the firm itself would\nnever fully acknowledge her,
and MOMA did not include\nher in the credit either.
Actually, in this period\nof the post-war year,
all the great masters\nassociated for the first time
with other architectural on\nkey projects-- for example,
Mies van der Rohe worked with\nPhilip Johnson on the Seagram
Building, was the\ncrucial intervention
as client of Phyllis\nLambert as both patron
and the own architect.
That was Phillip Lambert that\nconvinced her father, Seagram,
that wanted to hire a very\nconventional architect
that Mies will do the building.
So again, the Seagram\nBuilding will not
exist without Phyllis Lambert.
In 1943, Walter Gropius founded\nthe architect collaborative
tadt with a group\nof young architects.
And in 1963, he collaborated\nwith the corporate office
of Emery Roth and Sons\nfor the Pan Am building.
Many other examples--
Wallace Harrison is told, if\nyou want, from the corpus here,
the forms for the new\nheadquarters of the United
Nations in New York.
Rem Koolhaas has\nactually suggested
that such partnerships\nare always overlooked,
even they often contribute the\nmore idiosyncratic features
of the buildings.
Here still is the\nUnited Nations.
And Koolhaas' point is that\nthose of the perversion
of the masters.
From the 1930s\nKoolhaas wrote in 1996,
when he began working\nwith Lily Reich,
on Mies left the theatrical to\nothers-- perversoin by proxy
from her silk and velvet to\nJohnson's chain mail in the
in the fourth Seasons.
What is the connection?
Who took advantage?
Once again, it's\nsymptomatic to me
that it takes an architect and\nnot a critic or a historian
to point to the obvious,\neven if in fact he
gets the facts wrong, Lily\nReich having being collaborating
Mies since the mid 20s.
But the question is the\nquestion of collaboration
is what he gets right.
Collaborations, to return\nto the initial point,
is the secret life of modern\narchitecture, the secret life
of architects, in a way,\nthe domestic cultural life
of architecture.
And nowhere is this more\nevident than in architects
who live and work together.
With couples for whom there's\na complete identification
between home life\nand office life--
precisely, I think the\nsensitivity Koolhaas
to the question of\ncollaboration is
also personal or\nautobiographical in as much
as OMA was also two couples.
And of course, there is Zada\nHadid, that at some point
joined the office only for one\nyear, who was terribly unhappy
and actually, in this\ncollage, it's also interesting
that this is practically at\nthe door in a I'm leaving,
two you guys can.
So of course, Madelon\nVriesendorp, Rem Koolhaas,
and Elia Zenghelis and Zoe.
Zenghelis were part\nof the practice.
And many times, at least\nin the initial years--
I haven't been heard him\ncomplaining so much recently--
he complained in the\nearly years so much
that, despite the huge\neffort of naming his practice
Office of Metropolitan\nArchitecture,
the press tended to\nprefer only one name.
So they will continue to\ntalk about Rem Koolhaas
and not about OMA\nand not acknowledging
fully the rest of the partners.
So as I say, nowhere\nis this more emblematic
that with architects that\nwork and to live together
with couples for whom there's\na complete identification
between home life\nand office life.
Ray and Charles\nEams in the 1950s
provided actually a\nmodel for couplings
in following generations.
By couplings, I mean\ncollaborations in which
there is also some intimate\nrelationship, in particular
for Alison and Peter Smithson,\nwhose partnership in turn
provided a model for Robert\nVenturi and Denise Scott Brown,
believe it or not, and for\nEnric Miralles and Carme Pinos
a generation later.
So a couple in a way identifying\nthemselves with other couple.
These guys were absolutely\nobsessed with the Smithsons,
whom they had made when they\nwere very young kids studying
in Urbino Urbino was a school\nin Italy, a summer school, where
students from different parts\nof school of architecture
all over Europe will go there\nfor two months with Giancarlo
De Carlo.
And they found themselves with\nthe Smithsons teaching there,
and they formed a\nlongtime relationship.
The couplings actually\nreached an enormous level
of resentment and\nnervousness from all camps,
and that includes women.
The phallic myth of the solo\narchitect, the isolated genius,
is one of the most regressive\nand reactionary understanding
of architecture.
But unfortunately it's\nstill the more pervasive.
In this climate,\nI think there is
much to learn from the\nSmithson's if only to remind
ourselves that it\ntook more than half
a century before\nwomen architects were
on equal footing in\npartnership with man.
Margaret McDoland collaborated\nwith Charles Rennie Mackintosh,
Lily Reich with Meis,\nCharlotte Perriand,
with Le Corbusier, Aino\nAalto with Alvar Aalto.
But their extraordinary\ninfluences
was never completely\nacknowledged.
Only Charles and\nRay Eames, we did
for the first time have a firm,\nwhich at least in the name,
would recognize the\ntwo partners as equals.
And only with the\nSmithsons did we have that
a woman puts her name first\nand her work is finally
fully acknowledged by all.
Of course, institutions,\nparticularly eastcoast
institutions, I must say-- the\nMuseum of Modern Art, the New
York Times, Harvard University,\nI'm sorry, were in denial.
A devastated Esther McCoy\nwrote to the Eams apologizing
for an article that had just\nappeared in the New York Times
where the name of Ray had\nbeen erased from the article.
And she says, Dear Charles\nand Ray, the Times story
was an embarrassment\nto me, as it
must have been painful to you.
It was originally, as\nrequested, a 5,000 story
and was cut, at their\nrequest, to 3,500.
And when Paul Goldberger, he\ncalled and said it was fine.
Then he turned me over to\nan editorial assistant,
and Barbara Williams, who\nhad endless complaints--
I won't bore you,\nbut the two things
we settled down on\na death struggle--
death struggle-- were that\nRay's name must be included.
Imagine that you have\nto fight for that,
that Ray's must be included\nand that a [inaudible] must not
be called a casting couch.
For 20 years, of course\nthe article appears
and Ray has disappeared and\n[inaudible] is called a casting
couch, right?
For 20 years, I have worked\nfaithfully with editors.
Now already in 1973, I have\ncome up against two editors--
he's 73--
who are unbelievably arrogant,\nthe basis of their complaint
being that I don't understand\nthe broad audience.
This is sheer nonsense.
The broad audience does\nnot object to a woman
being credited for work.
So this is the kind of thing\nthat critics like Esther McCoy
had to deal with.
But I mean, if the New\nYork Times was terrible,
the Museum of Modern\nArt was even worse,
they never were able to\nacknowledge Ray Eams.
Only Charles was credited in the\ninstitutions for the exhibition
of their work.
One that presented\nthat as one man saw
and the title, new\nfurniture designed
by Charles Eames in 1946.
Now this is particularly\ntragic because older members
of the Eams office were also\nnot credited for their work,
including-- and you see\nthe whole team there--
Gregory Aime, Coliver\nToya, Herbert Matter,
and Griswold Raphael.
And all of them resigned from\nthe office as a consequence.
So MOMA may have thought that\nthey were doing something very
nice by credited\nonly Charles, but it
had enormous\nconsequences for the firm
because this was one\nof the more, actually,
fruitful and productive\nmoments of the office.
And they all left.
And the relationship\nwas even personal.
You have, for example,\nhere Alexander Matter
who was the son\nof Herbert Matter,
and was also here on top\nof this plywood elephant.
So there an intimate and\nalso personal relationship.
And all of this was sent to\ngarbage by this stupidity.
The exhibition-- sorry--\nthe exhibition and catalogue
of the good design\nexhibitions of the 1950s,
where also Charlers and\nRay Ears were a part,
did not again give\ncredit to Ray,
who is in fact seen in\nmany photographs installing
the saw next to the\ncreator, Edward Hofmann Jr.
So to my knowledge,\nshe is the one really
that is there\ndoing all the work.
But she doesn't\nappear in the credit.
Only on the last\npage of the catalog,
there are a few\nlines crediting her
with assistance in preparing\nthe show and the book,
but not really for\nthe work itself.
Even as late as\n1973, the same year
of the New York Times article\nArthur Drexler's introduction
to the exhibition on Charles\nEams for the design collection
did not properly credit\nRay, which is only
mentioned as an assistant.
If institutions have\ndifficulties acknowledging
the Eams partnerships, the\nSmithsons, on the other hand,
could identify.
They were absolutely\nfascinated with the Eams.
They followed them\neverywhere, and they
keep writing to them\nthese affectionate notes.
At one level, their born\nwith their elder couple
was personable.
Their standard form of\naddress in correspondence--
this is is all from the\narchives-- is from RC to--
to R and C from A and\nP, and they usually
closed with effusive\ndisplays, like [inaudible]
very affectionately, or we think\nof you often, and much love.
Their writings are also full\nof expressions of admiration.
One by one of all of the\npieces of the Eams work
are treated as precious\nicons, magical tokens,
that are presented as pardigms\nfor their own practice.
Of the Eams chair, the Smithsons\nwill write, for example,
that the chair was\nlike a message of hope
from another planet, that it's\nthe only chair that one could
put in an interior today-- they\nsay, the only one they will
put in their own living room.
Eams chairs, they say, they\nbelonged to the occupant,
not-- well, this one, they\nbelonged to the [inaudible]
only.
But the Mies chairs\nbelonged to the occupant,
which I think is a very\ninteresting observation.
Mies chairs are\nespecially of the building
and not of the occupant.
I think everybody\nwill agree with this.
No, when you look at\nthe Barcelona chair,
you think, I mean, who\nis this chair made for.
I was fascinated\nwhen the [inaudible]
did that beautiful installation\nin the Barcelona Pavilion.
And I saw them sitting in\none of the stools assigned
in the book, and\nthey perfectly fit.
I mean, whose bodies that\nwill feel comfortable
in these chairs of Mies?
In any case, of the Eams\nselect and ranged technique,
the award, the award of the\nSmithsons, the Smithsons says,
as a design method it's\ncloser to flower arrangement
and to good taste in\nthe function of rooms
with collectors pieces.
And then they claim to\nhave to used the method
themself in designing and\nequipping our own houses.
The Eams, they write,\nhad made the respectable
to like pretty things.
This seems extraordinary.
But in our world, pretty\nthings are equated
with social irresponsibility.
Now of the Eams unique\nphotographic technique,
the Smithsons write,\nwe who ourselves
are very attentive listeners\nand watchers of everything
the Eams have made-- you\nsee this complete obsession
with everything, right?
We have taken their invention\nof the flat on color
documentation of objects as part\nof the way we now also work.
So you can see that,\nin every instance,
we are presented with something\nwith an acute, actually,
observation of an\naspect of the Eams work.
And then at the same\ntime with the way
in which they, the Smithsons,\nappropriated it and made
it theirs.
Take, for example,\nthis smooth transition
from using in the Eams\nchairs, as they say before,
to designing their\nown furniture.
And they write, with the\nfirst interiors years
sketches of this\nproject [inaudible],,
we realized we had a problem.
What was to be put\nin our furniture?
We needed objects that\nachieve a culture or feat.
They could not be falling\nback on the Thonert
chair sold in France and\nused by Le Corbusier.
As a response to\nthis realization
came the [inaudible],,\na chair which
looked as if it might follow\nyou, or follow its owner
room to the room\nand on to the beach.
So here is the chair that\nthe Smithsons designed.
And incredibly enough, was\nappropriated immediately
by the Miralles.
Enric Miralles and Carme Pinos,\nthey reproduced this house,
and then they installed\nin their house.
The Smithsons chairs\ntake on precisely
the same characteristics they\nascribe to the Eams chairs.
They occupy the space\nvacated by the Thonet.
They are from the same\nperiod as the architecture,
as for example in\nthe Smithsons house
of the future, where they are\nclearly inspired by the Eams.
But at the same time,\nit's also different.
And very important, they\nbelonged to the occupant
and not to the building.
So the Smithsons put themselves\nin the place of the Eams,
absorbing their\nmode of operation
rather than the specific\ndetails of their form.
But the key symptoms\nof identification
between the Smithsons\nand the Eams
are not just there the endless\nreference to particular aspects
of the Eams.
They are also in the\ncouple's techniques
of presenting\nthemselves and the kinds
of obsessions they manifest.
And above all-- and perhaps\nthis is not surprising when one
couple bonds with another--
the symptoms are in\nthe pervasive sense
of domesticity, literal\ndomesticity as when
Peter Smithson reflects on\nthe Eams breakfast table,
and of course he saves that\nfor the Eams, the table.
The breakfast table is a form\nof architecture only then
in the same movement to go\nback to Walter Gropius and Ise
Gropius breakfast table in\nthe home in Massachusetts
near here.
And we end up with\nan imagine of Alison
at breakfast on a snowy day in\ntheir country house in Funhill.
So they trade this\ndomesticity in all this.
And actually\nconceptual domesticity
as when, in the\nsame article, Peter
organizes the history\nof architecture
from the Renaissance to the\npresent as that of our family,
as more a family of\nonly six members.
[inaudible] Alberti\nFrancisco de Giorgo
represented the generation\nof the Renaissance,
and Mies, the Eams,\nand the Smithsons
represented three generations\nof modern architecture.
Do you see what is says there?
Piper Editorial.
This is a lecture here.
And the poster was done\nby a student from Harvard,
apparently under instructions\nfrom Peter Smithson
in a telephone call from London.
So there are three\nareas of the Renaissance
and the three generations\nof the present.
The Smithsons made many,\nmany, many family trees.
But what is incredible is\nthe couple's insistence
on the inclusion on themselves\nin these family trees.
In the modern architectural\ngenealogy within [inaudible]
and which they were\nable to communicate
in such brilliant ways\nin their writings,
the Smithsons wanted\nto see themselves
as following the\ntradition of Mies.
Peter, for example, to\nwrite my own debt to Mies
is so great that\nit's difficult for me
to disentangle what I\nhold as my own thought.
So often they have\nbeen the results
of insights received from him.
So he cannot even know what he\nthought himself or what he got
from Mies.
But if Mies was the architect\nof the heroic period
that they most\nadmired, the Eams were
like their favorite cousins,\nthe ideal for the second, less
heroic generation, the\ngeneration straddling World War
II.
And it was with them, in\nfact, that the Smithsons
felt closer alliances.
They keep producing\nthese geneologies.
For example, on the occasion of\nour lecture of Alison Smithson,
where she goes the see\nthe Farnsworth House,
she makes these genealogy,\nwhich goes from the Farnsworth
House to the Eams house to\ntheir own pavilion in Fonthill.
Or then Villa Savoye on another\noccassion is Villa Savoye.
So the Eams are the thing that\nstayed, do you realize that?
So the Eams is\nalways in the middle
or, in this particular case,\nthat with Reedbull House,
the Eams House, and again,\ntheir house in Fonthill.
In a lecture by\nPeter in connection
with the reconstruction\nof the 1956
exhibition of the\nindependent group,
he links the party on\npavilion with the Eams house
points out that the Eams\ntwo had been familiar
with the Mies sketch of\nthe glass house of 1934,
and again different projects\nproduce different genealogies.
And this is interesting--\nagain, to return to the question
of women--
because Peter Smithson--\nwhat a kind of [inaudible],,
I because that could not be\nmore separated from this idea.
And he [inaudible].
Never mind.
Peter Smithson was significantly\none of the first architects
to point to the significance of\nwomen in modern architecture.
He keep emphasizing women in\nwhat he calls the female line.
And he writes, much\nof the inheritance
reaches us through\nthe female line.
And he mentions [inaudible],,\nwho collaborated of course
with [inaudible] for\nthe [inaudible] House.
Lily Reich, Charlotte\nPerriand, Ray Eams--
those are the four\nnames he mentioned.
And of course, the line\ncontinues all the way,
in his view, to Alison\nSmithson, in what
Peter calls a conscious homage\nto the founding mothers.
Now we have talked a lot\nabout the founding fathers.
In architecture, it's always\ntalking about the founding
fathers.
But this is the first\ntime that I have
heard the founding mothers.
The Smithsons, who were very\nsensitive to women's presence
in the history of\narchitecture for our century
more than any historian or\ncritique of that period,
but the women they\nidentify are always
symptomatically in couples.
And this may have\nbeen, for example,
the symptomatic absence of\nsignificant figures like
[? guile ?] Ingrid, not of\ninterest to them because they
cannot put her in a partnership.
So they refer to my Margaret\nMcDonaold, and Mackintosh.
Probably you have never hear\nabout Margaret McDonaold.
Have you ever heard\nabout Margaret McDonaold?
I mean, for Mackintosh,\nhe spent his entire life
saying that he was normal,\nthat he was a genius.
Nobody seemed to have\nbelieved retroactively.
But the thing is\nthat, in many ways,
I think we are going backwards.
Because the other day,\nI was doing research
on something else,\nand I came upon this
a moment in the early 20th\ncentury when Margaret McDonaold
goes with Mackintosh,\nand they put together
an exhibition in Vienna.
And all the newspapers\nand all the magazines
talk about Margaret McDonaold,\nand the red haired women,
this is strong woman that\nhas done this great project,
and they practically\ndon't mention him.
So what's wrong with us?
What's wrong that the journalist\nand the critics of the time
have no problem recognizing her,\nand one hundred and-- and what
is it--
18 years later, we are\nstuck with Macintosh.
And we don't know that\nhe spent his entire life
saying that he was actually\nquite a regular guy,
that she was actually\nunbelievable.
Why will he say that?
Why will we say that?
It has to be something, right?
So what was I saying?
So he refers to Margaret\nMcDonald and Rennie Mackintosh,
Charlotte Perriand, and\nLe Corbusier, [inaudible]
Lily Reich and Meis and so on.
So a couple in a way identifying\nthemselves with other couples,
perhaps identifying\nother couples,
perhaps identifying\nthemselves with other couples.
As Alison put it, I can see the\npart played by Ray Eams in all
that they do, the perseverance\nin finding what exactly
is the one thing wanted,\nalthough the secret may not
even know the exact object\nuntil finally it's seen.
Or when writing about Mies,\nPeter suddenly remarks,
as if talking to himself, I want\nto know more about Lily Reich.
And in a footnote to this--
because this a [inaudible] and\nhe writes a footnote to this
very blunt comment--
I want to know more\nabout Lily Reich.
You normally don't write that\nin a scholarly book, right?
You won't write that.
I think it's kind of fresh.
I want to know more\nabout Lily Reich.
In a footnote, he points out\nto this picture of [? meet ?]
and Lily Reich in 1933 published\nin this book of Ludwig Glasser,
this silvery book\non Mies furniture
in the collection of the\nMuseum of Modern Art.
But he says nothing about it.
It's this picture\nof Mies and Reich
on a boat where they each\nlook in the other's direction,
but their gaze\nsymptomatically never cross.
But it's also not\njust heterosexual
couples that interest\nthis [inaudible]..
And this is fascinating to me.
When discussing Johanes\nDuiker in the heroic period
of modern architect,\nPeter writes,
it is not for me to deal with\nthe relationship between Duiker
and Bernard Bivjoet.
I speak of them as one eminence.
In fact, Duiker Bivjoet\nhave collaborated
in many projects including\nthe famous Zonnestral
Sanatorium in\nHilversum, the open area
schools in Amsterdam, etc.
Do we know these projects\nas a collaboration?
No, we tend to think about\nas the projects of Duiker.
Same thing happened\nwhen Bivjoet goes
to parties and collaborates\nwith [inaudible]
in this beautiful\n[french] in Paris.
Last year there was a\nbeautiful exhibition
in the US museum,\nextensive documentation,
and great material.
And this poor Bivjoet that had\ncollaborated on the project
was not even in the record.
And you go like,\nhow is it possible
that they make such a big deal\nabout how this was the best
project of [inaudible] and\nhow nothing else that he do
was anywhere closer to this.
And could it be that Bijvoet had\nhave something to do with it?
Because it's the same\nguy that also did this,
that collaborated this.
Duiker never did anything better\nthan when he was with him.
So actually something\nthat Alison told me--
actually, she was very\nupset when Enric Miralles
split with Carme Pinos.
They were very upset.
It was like they were breaking\nthemselves apart, too.
And they happened\nto be in New York.
I have invited them to\ngive a lecture in Princeton
this is 1992.
And he said, Beatrice, there\nis something in collaboration--
what did he say?
Something the addition is higher\nthan the sum of the parts.
Something else happens,\nthat [inaudible]
would each of us contribute.
And he says, they would\nnever do, neither of them
will rise to the same level\nthat they did together again.
And that was actually\na good prediction.
Anyway, so Bijvoet-- yes,\nand speaking of soap operas,
Bijvoet arrived in Paris\nwith his wife and his child
and was the wife of Dukier.
I mean like, what?
And they were all living\ntogether in the same flat
and eventually Bijvoet\ndivorced his wife
and married the wife\nof Duiker, Erminne.
So anyway, looking at the--
because it's also interesting\nthat the whole history
of modern architecture\nis full of soap
operas that we don't talk about.
But it's also, we have\nto look into that.
That's super interesting.
Why would we not look into that?
That explains a lot\nabout what happens.
Anyway, going back to this\ncover of the heroic period,
I think it's evident\njust by looking
at the corner of this book\non modern architecture--
one of my favorite books\non modern architecture--
that it's evident already\nthat the Smithsons are
interested in collaborations.
For them, the history\nof architecture
is the history of\na conversation.
You can see that it's not a\nheroic architect in the core,
but Mies and Le Corbusier in\nthe grounds of the Wiesenhof
discussing this project here,\nLe Corbusier and Gropius
in a cafe in Paris,\nagain, arguing, talking.
CIAMs and Team 10s\nwere for them occasions
for a wider conversation, if\nyou want a family conversation.
And think about the difference\nbetween these photographs
of the CIAM people are\nall kind of like soldiers
in the kind of new situation\nthat the Team 10 is creating.
So Alison also wrote Team\n10 is a small family group.
And this very much\nsuggests these kind
of pictures that you\nhave of the Team 10s,
very, very different\nof these ones.
Alison wrote, Team 10\nis a small family group
who knows each\nother so well that
can begun to work together\nwith a better mind
that each school achieve alone.
Again, the question\nof collaboration--
that they could work together\nbetter than they could
each of them work alone.
And on the occasion of\nPierre Jeanneret's death,
Alison broad a very\nmoving report here,
Alison and Peter,\nwhere they write,
we have a various [inaudible]\nsignificant houses,
and indeed, there is\nFarnsworth, a few early Rudolf
houses and very little else.
The earliest document is from\nthe architects journal June 27,
1946.
It is these with the thought\nof on the death of Pierre
Jeanneret.
The house on here embodies the\nsweetest collaboration with
Jean Prouv , who really\nhas been unfortunate in his
architects' collaborators.
So look at what is happening.
The Smithsons are paying tribute\nto Pierre Jeanneret by showing
his house with Prouv .
So they removed him from Le\nCorbusier's gigantic figure,
but only to pair\nhim again right away
in the sweetest collaboration.
And in the process, they\nintroduce the question
of Prouv  and happy\nmarriage, so to speak.
For example, when\nthey say the same.
The suitor is going with Jean\nProuv  who really has to be
unfortunate in his\narchitects collaborators.
I mean, I think he's kind of\nopening a possibility of us
to study here about what\nis going on with this
collaboration\nbecause, of course,
Prouv  had collaborated with\na succession of architects
including Tony Garnier,\n[inaudible] Le Corbusier,
[inaudible] for the\nFreie University, etc.
But since the\n[inaudible] remember
that to Jeanneret bringing\nup the matter of partnerships
raises questions\nabout what is perhaps
the most unexplored, the\nmost unknown partnership
of the century and\nasks the question
of what generally\nmay have contributed
to the work of Le Corbusier.
Nobody knows this\nPaul Pierre Jeanneret
I have worked a lot\non Le Corbusier.
My dissertation was\non Le Corbusier.
I spent years in the\nFundacion Le Corbusier.
I never knew that\nit was so short.
It's not that Le\nCorbusier is a giant.
He's really little.
And I had to go with\nmy students to--
I taught a class on Chandigarh.
I took the students to\nChandigarh in Chandigarh.
On my god, in Changdigarh,\nthey adored Jeanneret
because he was there.
He was the one that built
Changdigarh.
He went there.
He had spent years there.
He wanted to be buried there.
He died there.
He loved India.
And then I started paying\nattention to Jeanneret
and realized how little\nwe know about this figure
here on the beach--
I don't know-- boxing\nwith Le Corbusier.
And then finally, there\nis the love affairs.
Here is a Lotte Beese,\nthat we mentioned before--
first a student in\nthe Bauhaus to be
admitted in the architecture.
They were all put into\nthe textile section.
All the women, they were not\nallowed to be in the metal--
I mean, it's a whole history.
So Lotte insisted on\nbeing in architecture
and had actually an affair with\nJonanes Meyer, who had finally
agreed that she will enter into\nthe School of Architecture,
but also told her that,\nif he were to do that,
she probably would have\nto associate herself
professionally with\na male architect
because otherwise she will\nnever be able to do anything
in her life.
She did exactly that.
She associated herself with\nhim, as he was married.
And then he's made\nhead of the Bauhaus.
And she was a student\nwas asked to leave.
Why?
Because it wouldn't look good\nthat the director of the school
was having a story\nwith a student,
one that's in [inaudible].
She have to leave.
But anyway, so here\nyou have Lotte Beese,
and I don't who is this guy,\nthis creep in the background.
But that's that.
I don't know about--
I mean, I think Lotte\nBeese is super fascinating.
As you know, then\nshe married Mart Stam
and became Lotte\nBeese Stam, and she
the head of the reconstruction\nof the hall of Rotterdam.
And she's an force.
She's an unbelievable\nin architecture.
And she really was interested\nin any of these guys.
Anyway you think about it,\nall she's in this Bauhaus,
she's always photographing this\nLotte Beese and other women
in the Bauhaus,\namazing photographs.
Annie and Joseph Ahlberg,\nbut particularly I want to--
from other love\naffairs but I want
to particularly talk about\nthe affair of Catherine Bauer
with--
what's his name-- Lewis\nMumford, which you see here.
Catherine Bauer was a social\nhistorian who married,
by the way, William Worster,\nLewis Mumford in 1940
and in a way politicized\nhim, infusing
his domestic science with hard\nsocial and unpolitical ideas.
But before that, he had\nalso radically changed
the work of Lewis\nMumford by inspiring
him to take on the grand themes\nof technology and community,
which will become the basis\nof his best known books.
And Mumford in turn\nencouraged Bauer
to contemplate aspects of\nthe sign that could not
be quantified to\nbroaden and humanized
the definition of\nhousing reform doing
the several years\nof the rove affair
while he was married\nto someone else.
Mumford had met Bauer in 1929.
Listen to this because you\nhave read a lot about Mumford
but you haven't\nread these I'm sure.
We were drawn together\nby our common interesting
in modern architecture.
From the beginning, we were\nexcited by each other's minds
and plunged and leaped in a\nsea of ideas like two dolphins,
even before our bodies\nhad time for one another.
Wow.
Catherine's challenging\nin mind, particularly
during the first two\nyears of our intimacy,
had a stimulating\nand liberating effect
upon my whole development.
In effect, she played the\npart of of Hilda Wangel
in Ibsens play, the voice\nof younger generation,
bidding the Master\nBuilder to quit
building modest,\ncommonplace houses
and to erect, instead,\nan audacious tower, even
if, when he has reached the\ntop, he might fall to his death.
OK, wow.
So There: you have another\nMumford from the one
that you normally talk.
Anne Tying one of the\nfirst women architects
to graduate from Harvard\nUniversity, from this place,
became Louis Kahn, a\nlover, as you know,
were working in his office\nand collaborating closely
in the designs.
In a letter to Tyng where\nshe was in Rome in 1954--
you want to know\nwhy he was in Rome?
Because she got pregnant and\nthen, of course, because she
was married to someone else.
She was told to go to Rome.
It was better because otherwise\nit was kind of embarrassing.
And she says in a letter,\nI'm waiting anxiously
for us to be together again\nin our wonderful ways of love
and work, which again\nis nothing really
but another form of love.
Louis Kahn.
And Anne Tying writes,\nwe were both workaholics.
In fact, work had become\na kind of passionate play.
We were able to bring out\neach other's creativity,
building on each other's ideas.
The full of tragedy\nof the relationship
that you probably know well\neven if you have seen--
I don't know whether\nyou have seen the film.
Anne Kahn's ultimate\nselfishness unfolds.
The letters between them, which\nare all published in a book
that was done by\n[inaudible] a few years ago,
remain filled with the\ndetails of design--
so published designs\nand private soap operas
are here inseparable.
As the institutions of\nrecords for the field,
the Museum of Modern\nArt found itself
in the middle of many questions\non disputes of attribution.
Tyng, for example, who had\nended her relationship with Kahn
in 1960, shortly before the\nmuseum's visionary architecture
exhibition was surprised\nnot to be credited
for her work in the\nexhibition and particularly
for the city tower in\nPhiladelphia, which
is a really hard project.
She says, I did not get an\ninvitation to the opening.
When I ask our\nsecretary about it,
he say my name might not\neven be on the credit label.
I merely asked Lou if\nmy name was credited.
He answered no.
So I suggested yesterday it may\nbe better if he called museum
than if I called.
There was no Strurm and Drang.
He simply called and\nmy name was added.
I was profoundly shocked that\nLou would do such a thing,
especially since [inaudible]\nprogressive architecture,
the Atlas, and a number\nof other publications
already have given\ncredit to both of us.
I could not believe that\nhis desire for a recognition
will erode his integrity\nsince sharing credit
with me will not necessarily\ndiminish his fame.
In the end, the\ncity tower appear
as Lou Kahn and Anne Tyng\narchitects associated
in the exhibition at MoMA.
Kahn publicly, if\ninadequately, as you will,
acknowledged Anne Tyng when in\n1973, a year before his death,
he gave the National Academy\nof Design a self-portrait
of himself along with a portrait\nhe had made of Anne Tying
in 1946 inscribed with\nthe following sentence--
this is a portait of\nAnne Tying architect,
who was the geometry conceiver\nof the Philadelphia Tower.
Well, that's not\nexactly so because I
thought of the essence,\nbut she knew its geometry.
To this day, she\npursues the essence
of constructive geometry and\nnow at the university of Penn
and other places like Harvard.
We worked together\non my projects
from a purely conception\nbase, December 27, 1972.
So even in the moment of\nacknowledging her contribution
to this project, he draws\nthe line between the essence
that apparently he thought\nabout and the geometry
that she figured out.
And this makes no\nsense in [inaudible]
that obviously, as anybody\ncan see, is all geometry.
So what is the\nessence exactly here?
Well, anyway, to conclude\nperhaps the new fascination
with collaboration is actually\npart of a new voyeurism.
Television, the internet,\nand social media
have brought a new\nsense of limits.
Talks shows, blogs, social\nnetworking sites, etc.,
are changing the standards\nfor what we consider private.
Can we expect architecture\nto remain immune.
We don't care anymore so\nmuch about the heroic figure
of the modern architecture,\nof an architecture,
about the facade, but about\ntheir internal weaknesses.
Architectures themselves\nhaving started,
or have been doing\nit for a while
actually, to tell\nus private stories
about their desperate\nattempts to get jobs,
about their\npathological experiences
with clients, about falling\nin the street, and even
about the [inaudible].
And we pay more\nattention than they
were trying to dictate to\nus what their work meant.
On the one hand, there\nis a concerted effort
to demystify architectural\npractice and debunk heroes.
On the other hand, all the\ndetails of private life
are being incorporated\ninto a kind of heroic image
as in a kind of therapy.
And finally, who has been\nkeeping all these secrets
for so long?
Historians and critics have\nfelt more confident, I think,
even re-assured responding\nto the idea of an individual
author and the former qualities\nof the building as an art
object than to the messiness--\nbecause it's very messy--
of architectural practice.
Paradoxically, as we have\nseen, practicing architects
have tended to be more\nsensitive to the subject
perhaps because they know\nfrom their own experience what
goes on really in an\noffice and are endlessly
curious about what's happening\nin other people's practices.
Architects in partnerships\nfrom Denise Scott Brown to Rem
Koolhaas have publicly\ncomplained about the opposition
of critics and the media\nwith the single figure,
despite their offices at efforts\nto provide precise credit.
Since Denise Scott Brown\ntalked to the Alliance of Women
in Architecture in\nNew York in 1973--
1973 seems to be a date\nthat we keep coming back to.
On sexismo and the star\nsystem in architecture
that became the subsequent\narticle room at the top.
Sexismo on the star\nsystem in architecture,
but that circulated\nprivately for many years
before it was finally\npublished in that book,
Architecture, a Place\nfor Women in 1989.
A number of women\narchitects had been
raising issues of their own.
It's not by chance that\nwomen and gay scholars
have been leading the way.
The ease of collaboration\nis of course
indebted to feminist\ncriticism with its focus
on the veiling of contributions\nand the domesticity of power.
More recent scholarship\non areas of race,
sexuality, cultural studies,\npost-colonial studies, etc.,
has also a crucial resource.
Architecture history is starting\nto absorb many of its lessons
and opening research\nto new questions.
And my prediction is many more\nsecrets are bound to come out.
Thank you very much.
[side conversation]
Hi, does anybody\nhave a question?
I actually have a\nquestion if anybody would
you like to keep thinking.
And I don't intend it\nto sound cheeky at all,
but this is an incredible\namount of archival research.
And I'm wondering\nalmost what duration
and how many collaborators\nit requires to pull together
this much information?
This much information?
You mean my own research?
Actually, in this\nparticular case, as I say,
I was fascinated with\nthis question for a while,
and there were a number of\noccasions in which this was
put together over the years.
So it looks like a lot,\nbut in fact Alison Smithson
died in 1992 or something.
And there was an\nevent at [inaudible],,
and this is the first time that\nI thought about the Smithsons
obessions with the Eams.
And so, because I have\nbeen doing all that work
for domesticity at war, I had\na lot of archival material
from the Library\nof Congress, which
included personal letters\nbetween the Smithsons
and the Eams.
And I knew about\ntheir relationship.
And then I interviewed\nPeter extensively
for an issue of\nOctober magazine,
and the issue of the\nEams and their travels
to California and their\nobsession with the Eams.
So I kept make\nmaking notes, where
I was doing something\nelse, which of course
they end up in a group\ninterview for October.
So it's a project that it's\nbeen with me for a long time,
and I have been adding things.
Then what happened?
Most recently at the Museum\nof Modern Art, first they
had a conference that\nabout MoMA women,
all the women that are in\nthe Museum of Modern Art.
They budget only one\nperson in architecture.
It was a two day\nconference, right?
So then they were\ndoing the book.
And I said to them,\nif you're going
to be inviting me like\na token architect,
maybe I'm not going to do it.
And so, they invited\na few other people.
But I ended up looking\ninto the archives.
And a lot of what I\nfound is not here.
But now I'm thinking\nabout putting it together
in a book about\nthe these stories.
There's a lot in the Museum\nof Modern Art archives,
about questions of attribution.
It's not only Tying.
And it's not only\nthis a lot of prom.
So as the institution\nof record, they
have been deliberately\nkeeping women
out in such a way that I think\nthey were themselves scared
if I were to put all these\ndetails into their MoMA women--
I don't know whether\nyou have ever
seen this big, fat book of\nMoMA women, most art world.
And because it was\nMoMA, I thought
that I should just deal with\nwhat is in the archives.
And so, they didn't want\nthat I wasn't going so--
they wanted a little\nbit more diffuse.
So it ended up being\na combination of some
of those things of the Smithsons\nand a little bit about MoMA,
but not really\ntotally everything
that I have I found\nin the archives.
That's an interesting\ndevelopment.
I'd love to see the book.
We'll start down here.
Beatrice, thank you so much.
This is like the highlight\nof my year that you're here.
It's super exciting.
We have a new dean--
chair, sorry.
New chair, Mark.
Sorry, my bad.
I'm still new.
We have a new chair, Mark\nLee, and I just was wondering
if the fact that we have Mark\nLee instead of the Johnston
of Johnson Mark\nLee as our dean--
the GSC's never\nhad a female dean--
if there's maybe an\necho of the ventur--
chair, did I do it again?
Sorry.
Have we had a--\noh, Toshiko Mori.
But we've never\nhad a female dean.
You've never had a dean,\nbut you did have a chair.
Toshiko Mori, actually, Toshiko\nMori was in way, I will say,
don't take that bad.
But I will say you are now\nbehind because a [? whole ?]
course is like\nColumbia University,
is run by is a dean, at\nYale University [inaudible]..
Princeton, the dean\nis a woman, Penn.
And instead, you were ahead\nwhen Toshiko Mori was chair.
That was the first\ntime that a woman
in such an important\nposition, wasn't it?
I think historically.
So the question\nof how woman have
entered into a leadership\nposition in academia
is very interesting.
But I don't know whether\nyou were going there
or with the collaboration.
I mean, I was just\nthinking about Veturi Scott
Brown and the Pritzker\nPrize, and then just thinking
about Johnston Mark Lee\nand a new chair, sorry.
And I don't know.
It just feels relevant, and I\nwanted to just throw it to you.
Right, no, that's\nsuper interesting.
It's another collaboration.
And I hope she will\nalso be around.
I suppose-- if they are\ngoing to have the firm here
and in Los Angeles, but I don't\nknow how it's going to work.
But this is an interesting\nquestion that you are bringing.
It could also deanships be\nthought in a different way,
in a more collaborative way.
Or do we still have to\nhave the hero architect?
I mean, we come from--
the generation is the generation\nthat Mies was running this
and Gropius was the ta da da.
And now we're in a\ndifferent moment.
We don't need\nanother hero maybe.
We need something else, right?
So yes, even in education,\nthe question of collaboration
is of course super important.
Hi, Beatrice, I'm really\ninterested in your talk
and your research.
But I'm wondering\nif you have ever
come across criticism\nof intellectual life
versus private life\nthat we're more
interested in the real,\nactual life of this person
this figure than the private\nlife, and the private life
becomes--
it's serious, it's\nnot scholarly enough.
And I mean, you compared\nmovies with architecture.
But the movies, the real\ncredit is the director.
The editor, the\ncinematographer sometimes
doesn't get mentioned.
The make up person, nobody\never knows what that name is.
It's a name.
It doesn't get attention.
So there is a difference\nbetween a credit line
and the public's attention,\nwho's getting the attention.
So I wonder what your\nthoughts are on that.
Yeah, but at least\nthey are credited.
At least they are acknowledged.
At least there are Oscars for\nall kinds of different things.
Are there prizes in\narchitecture for all kinds
of-- not so much, right?
How about the intellectual\nand the private?
I suppose what I'm trying to\nsay is that you cannot make that
separation.
I think that's a polemic,\nbut that's what I'm saying.
And you know with Jacqueline\n[inaudible] I mean, come on,
you do did your thesis\nyour thesis at Princeton
on the question of\nJacqueline [inaudible],,
and her intimate\nrelationship with Gideon.
I mean, how can we think--
since I've read\nyour dissertation,
I cannot think of\nGiedion the same way.
I just cannot.
And of course, again, Giedion\nis a super significant hero.
How many people here know how\nincredible was Carola Gideon?
Impossible to understand\nSigried Giedion
without understanding\nCarola Giedion,
who put him into a\nlot of differences.
But then also the personal\naffairs are also important.
The affair with\nJacqueline brought him
into different areas as well.
And it's very, very significant,\nthe relationship and the impact
that it had on the world.
Those things cannot\nbe separated.
This project that\nwe just saw of Kahn
is inseparable from their\npersonal relationship.
Thank you for the talk.
It seems the history ended\nit at OMA, if I'm correct.
And I'm curious,\ntaking these themes
of private and\npublic, dirty secrets,
and even where I guess\npartnerships become
seen as domestic issues, I'm\ncurious if you could maybe
make some comments on how\nthese historic lines bring us
to today, where these\nthemes have a lot
to do with the MeToo\nmovement, with the shitty men
of architecture list.
Is there a line to be drawn,\nI mean, to connect these?
Yeah, probably, I'm not\nso sure that the history
finishes with OMA.
Ray was important\nto me in as much
as he at least was able, when\nlooking back historically
and paying attention to the\nquestion of the partners that
had emerged in the 50s, even if\nit was in person that he made
this reference to the perversion\nby proxy, even if it was kind
of--
I thought it was super\ninteresting that somebody
was paying attention that,\nyeah, who is taking advantage,
I ask people.
And the fact that he\ngot-- but I didn't
go into their relationship.
I didn't go into\nthe relationship.
But of course I'm fully aware\nof how Rem, also went many times
to see Bob Venturi in the\nbeginning of his career,
went to visit Bob Venturi and\nDenise Scott Brown repeatedly
and was fascinated by them.
And it's inevitable\nthat, when you
are in that kind of\npersonal relationship,
you also look at all the--
so whole thing\nabout role models,
I think the couples also\nsee other role models
in other couples.
I think it is very significant\nthat it's always other couples
looking at other couples.
And that's what\nI'm trying to say.
But I don't know\nwhether I finish
in Enric Miralles\n[inaudible] Carmen Pinos
is much younger than Rem.
So I guess that's the\nlast people I mention.
It's very hard to talk\nabout the present.
I'm a historian myself.
So in this particular\ncase, I would
say the work is\ntotally influenced
by what is happening now.
And it has been,\nas I said before,
in gestion for a long time.
So I was already sensitive\nto a lot of things
because now all of this\nis coming to the surface.
But it's not that we haven't\nbeen thinking about it
for all these years.
Marissa mentioned\nsexuality and space.
I can tell you a million\nstories from myself from others.
I was in this very\nroom when there
was a conference in which\nDenise Scott Brown was speaking.
And there were all the\nbig boys of architecture--
Peter Eisenman and Michael\nGraves and so and so on.
And then Peter Eisenman\ngot up and complained
that Robert Venturi had\nnot come and that he always
says the surrogate.
The surrogate was Denise.
So until very recently,\nthese kinds of things
were being said in public,\nand everybody laughed,
like how funny is that,\nthe he sends the surrogate.
The surrogate was Denise.
So of course, many\nother stories--
and to his credit,\nMoneo, who was chair--
told Peter that that\nwas not was not right.
But most of the time,\npeople just laughed--
They didn't laugh actually.
People booed him resoundingly.
This room, I was here,\nthe whole audience--
Yeah, all the women were\nin the back like screaming.
So no one laughed.
I mean, they was shouting.
Moneo stopped him, right?
So it was boo.
It was boo.
Wasn't really laughed about.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Some people were close\nto me, other boys.
Anyway, yeah, we were super mad.
That's true.
But these things still happen.
And it's not that long ago.
It was 1990 whatever,\n91, 90 whatever.
It's just-- the\nsurrogate, I mean.
So how do we go into-- it's\nvery touchy business, right?
It's a different--\nas a scholar, I
find it more difficult to go\ninto the details of previous
of practices.
But it doesn't have to be--
I suppose it changes as\nwe go on into the present.
And I suppose, if I were to take\nthis and turn it into a book,
then I will start thinking about\nhow we are collaborating today
differently, not\njust in architecture,
but in other aspects\nof our life and how
in this culture of sharing,\nthe idea of this single
is completely bankrupt\nand perhaps also thinking
about more positive\nmodels of things
that we see around\nourselves, of ways in which
people are collaborating today.
It would be more interesting.
Because this is more\nof historical, or more
looking back at all these\ncollaborations that have taken
place in the 20th\ncentury and the way
in which we have systematically\nignored for whatever reason.
And I suppose the question\nof the private, yeah.
I don't know.
I have to think about it, too.
Yes.
Hi, thank you.
So to jump on the question\nabout private life
and why is it being overshadowed\nby the intellectual.
And this might be a little\nraw and hard to talk about
at the present.
But what about personal\ncharacter of architects
and how that influences?
I'm thinking about Richard\nMeyer and some people,
including Paul\nGoldberger, debating
whether the moral compus\nthat overshadows his work.
So I was wondering what\nyou think, and this is all
coming to the surface.
And it seems that there's a lot\nof accomplices also over time
in letting this persist.
Right.
Again, once again,\nwe can separate
what is happening\nin architecture
with what is happening\nin the rest of the world.
When the Harvey\nWeinstein story happened,
I turned around to a friend\nand I said to him actually,
I wonder how long it will\nbe before things emerge
in architecture because we\nhave known these stories
for our very, very, very long--
not with a level of detail.
I was shocked myself\nwith some of the things
and also kind of the\ncrudity of all of them.
And what is the bathrobe?
I mean, what is wrong\nwith these guy, right?
The bathrobe, I\nmean, what is wrong--
But I have heard my share of\nstories at Columbia University
when I was teaching\nthere and at Princeton.
And of course, those were\nthings that we-- again,
like the secret of the family\nthat I was talking about that
we all knew about it, that\nwe knew who was more that--
why you shouldn't\nget into an elevator
alone with certain\ncharacters or why you should
be careful with certain people.
But we didn't bring\nourselves to--
among ourselves, I suppose\namong women we will say,
that guy is bad news.
But I mean, until recently this\nwas happening to all of us,
right?
I think there's\ntime for one more.
If anybody would like to ask?
Hi, in terms of other fields--
I'm thinking of\nliterature or science--
is there a league of\nColomina's and Colomino's that
are doing you what\nyou do in other areas
and that you're\nin contact with--
to know more of these\nstories that we don't know
about other heroes of the past?
It's so interesting that you\nsay that because of course there
must be.
Of course, literature is\na much more lonely field.
I mean, you can be a\nreally great writer
and you are not collaborating\nwith many people.
I mean, that's possible.
But science, science has\nalways been entirely open
about the idea that\nthey are collaborating.
Of course, there's a\nlot of shitty stories
about appropriating credit when\na lot of people are involved.
But in the field of science--\nand that it comes always
to the surface in tenure\ncases, in the humanities
versus the sciences in\nplaces like, I suppose,
Harvard or Princeton\nbecause in the humanities,
if you are, of course, writing\na paper with someone or a book,
you have written a book\nwith someone else--
that doesn't count.
That's how amazing it is.
Even if you apply to the\nGuggenheim for a fellowship
and you have written a book with\nsomeone, don't send that book.
They say that especifically\nbecause they couldn't
tell what it is that\nyou did and what it
is that the other person did.
You're like, what?
In the science,\non the other hand
it's perfectly acceptable\nfor tenure cases,
for all kinds of promotions\nfor even [inaudible]
the collective authorship.
We have not achieved\nthis in architecture.
But I suppose what you're\nsaying is also, have there been
in studies on this question.
I should look into that.
I should look into\nthat as I work
more into the question of\ncollaboration in architecture
and how the issue is changing.
And the feminine-- like\nfor example, with Kafka,
and worked hand by hand\nwith his secretary, that was
the one who typed the thing.
And most of us, we\ndon't know that.
And I'm sure there are thousands\nand thousands of stories
in all the fields that--
I don't know--
I wish there was like a\nleague of people like you
that just bring--
No, I don't.
But I will look into it.
That is a good point.
It still is different.
But, yeah, it's like the\nclient in architecture
is super significant and we\nowe it to Alison Freidman
to have brought that story.
But there are so many\nactors in architecture.
That is very important\nto pay attention to,
all the different contributions\nthat make such a complex thing
as architecture.
If anybody would like to join\nthe league of Colomina's, we
can have a sign up sheet.
Thank you so much\nfor your lecture.
Thanks, too, everybody.
[applause]
