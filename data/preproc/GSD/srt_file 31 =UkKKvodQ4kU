Thanks for coming out tonight\nto the Aga Khan Program Lecture.
The Aga Khan\nProgram is dedicated
to the study of Islamic\nart, architecture, urbanism,
landscape and conservation.
And also to the\napplication of knowledge
from that study and research to\ncontemporary design projects.
So, you will soon see that\nhaving Marina Tabassum here,
is kind of perfect\nfor that description.
Last autumn, Marina Tabassum\nwon the Aga Khan Award
for architecture for\nthe Bait-Ur-Rouf Mosque
and Community Center\nin Dhaka, Bangladesh.
The Mosque was completed in\n2012 and designed at the behest
of her grandmother.
It's been noted\nfor its, quoting,
"Quietly spectacular\nmanipulation of brick, light
and air".
But it's also been spoken\nabout for certain features that
have become part of the\nconventional architectural
vocabulary for Mosque,\nmainly domes and minarets.
And it's been noted for\nits conspicuous absence
of those conventions.
Tabassum's design seems\nto derive from two
intertwined investigations.
One, into the historical\nuses, developments
of Mosque in the Islamic\nworld, at large, and maybe
in the Bengali\ncontext in particular.
And I think of\nthings like program,
materials, but also\nprogram and materials
framed by historical concerns.
And the second, it seems,\nis a much more personal
understanding of the\nnature of the sacred
or the spiritual\ncommunal spaces,
needs of users and worshippers,\nand community members.
Ms. Tabassum graduated\nfrom Bangladesh University
of Engineering and Technology.
And then, shortly afterwards,\nfounded the architecture firm
Urbana with Kashef\nChowdhury in Dhaka.
In 1997, that firm\nwon the commission
for the Museum of Independence,\nand the Independence Monument
in Bangladesh.
With a master plan that included\na 50 meter tower monument.
I think we will see that, as\nwell as an underground museum
and urban plaza, and\nother components.
In 2005, after having worked\nas a partner and a founder
of Urbana for 10\nyears, Ms. Tabassum
established her own practice,\nMarina Tabassum Architects,
also in Dhaka.
She's currently the\nAcademic Director
of the Bengali Institute\nof Architecture, Landscape
and Settlements.
She served as a studio\nprofessor at Brock University,
at University of Asia\nPacific, as well as
a visiting professor\nof the University
of Texas in Arlington.
Please welcome Marina Tabassum.
[AUDIENCE CLAPS]
Thank you, Michael.
Thank you all for being\nhere, and thank you, Mossan,
for inviting me to share my work\nand my pursuit in architecture.
Quite often, when I do a talk,\nI'm asked where was I educated,
and I quite proudly say that\nI am entirely organic and made
in Bangladesh.
But there is, I mean, I don't\nknow how true that would
be because, though I have\nnever moved from my location
to be educated elsewhere.
But the school where I\nwent my formative years,
were in an American missionary\nschool, the Holy Cross.
So, I was exposed to a\nmulticultural, multi-religious
atmosphere from\na very early age.
And then, again,\nthe school where
I went for my architecture,\nthe Bangladesh University
of Engineering and Technology,\nthat was also set up
by Texas A&M. So, the\ncurriculum, which was followed,
was entirely an\nAmerican curriculum.
So, never been to America,\nbut in many ways, there
is a certain kind of an\ninteresting impression on me
of that.
So, I graduated in the mid\n90s with this entire scenario.
When I went into\npractice, and was
looking for a language\nof architecture,
what should it be that\nwould be my language?
That's when I think a\nsort of a crisis hit me.
What would be my language?
What would be the language\nthat I would like to pursue?
And that's when\nactually I started
looking into the land and\nthe landscape, the history.
And, in many ways, I\nthink that shaped the way
I think and I try to\npursue my architecture.
That's why I always\nlike to start
my presentation by giving a\nsmall introduction to where
I come from.
So, that's Bangladesh.
If you see here, that's\nthe Himalayan Range,
and from Himalayan Range,\nare these two major rivers,
the Brahmaputra and the Ganges.
And these two rivers are coming\ndown to the Bay of Bengal,
that eventually goes\ninto the Indian Ocean.
And as these two rivers have\nbeen flowing over centuries,
they've accumulated silt,\nand that silt basically
created the land,\nwhich is Bangladesh.
2/3 of Bangladesh is\ndelta, the Ganges Delta,
and it is the largest\ndelta in the world.
So, you see it has more than\n700 rivers crisscrossing all
around the entire landscape.
And what you see here, you\nsee water and land is just
an entirety.
You cannot distinguish\nbetween water and land.
What is land is water and\nwhat is water is land.
It's so soft and fragile.
And, as these mighty rivers\nchange their courses,
quite often they\nerode the banks.
And, again, in some\nplaces it emerges as land.
So, there is a constant play\nof emergence and erosion
that takes place.
And it's a very alluvial\nsoil, so very fertile.
It's green, as you can see.
The Earth is almost like\nmagic, you pop some seeds
and it comes out as the plants.
And, since the rivers\nare the major feature,
you can see that life has a\ncertain kind of living entirely
on water.
So, what is water can become\nland during the dry season.
And, again, during the\nmonsoon, that becomes water.
So, there is no distinct\nline between water and land.
And in many ways,\nthis is the reason
why you see a lot of\ninformality and impermanence.
People have a certain kind of\na psyche that, over a year,
as the land changes, when\nwater becomes the landscape,
people tend to move to the\ncity to look for a living.
And then, again, when\nit becomes dry again,
and there is a possibility\nof growing crops,
they go back to the landscape.
This, I find quite interesting.
You see that there is a lot of\nnegotiation and appropriation,
optimization that goes on.
What you see here as\ngreen, is actually water.
It's the water hyacinth.
And, quite often, when there\nis lack of flow in the water,
it becomes entirely filled\nwith water hyacinth.
And it's impossible to dig the\nboats crossing from one side
to the other.
And what the boatmen\ndo is, they basically
bring all their boats together\nand create a boat bridge.
So, that's how you negotiate\nwith land and water.
And I find that that's a\nvery interesting example.
Optimization.
How much do you really\nneed to make a salon?
A wall and a footpath,\nand that's just about it.
So, Tropic of Cancer basically\ncrosses through Bangladesh.
That's where it is.
You see the line?
And that's the reason why we\nhave a subtropical climate.
A high hot and high humidity\nduring the summer months.
That's why rain is something\nwe celebrate during the monsoon
season.
And the dry season,\nwhich is at a time when
we don't have any rain at\nall for a few months, no rain
and an absolutely dry, because\nthe wind comes from the north,
from the Himalayas, and so\nit has no moisture in it.
So, this becomes a\nvery dry landscape.
So, this is, actually\nin many ways,
this was something I\nlearned from Gazi, in a way.
About this image, here.
The Banglar Agony.
And it actually shows\nwhat you really need,
or how much you actually\nneed to live in this land.
With a moderate temperature and\nrain, all you need is a roof,
all you really need is\na roof to cover yourself
from the elements,\nand the high plains
to keep you away from the water.
And that's basically it,\nthat's all architecture
needs to be in the\nland where I come from.
And then, again, of course,\nthis blurring of the edges,
which you find quite\noften, long verandas.
Where the rooms are basically\nfor sleeping and keeping
your belongings,\nthere is one space,
which actually acts\nas the main living
space for the entire year.
And this is an element\nwhich I find quite unique.
Even when we grew up, we were\nliving in houses like that,
but you don't see that\nanymore in the landscape.
So, one of my first projects,\nwhen I was in Arbana,
was a pavilion apartment.
And there, we tried to work\non this idea of opening up
the walls.
And you see here that\nthe walls are entirely
opened up to create this\nsemi-open, semi-covered space.
It was designed or\nconceived as a pavilion.
And, as you open the doors\nhere, it opens to the outside,
so the room becomes a veranda.
This is the courtyard\nwhere I grew up.
And courtyards in our\nkind of climate and space,
is a very important\nand vital element,
which is almost like the lung\nof the building, that actually
lets it ventilate.
And, in a way, that\ncourtyard, to some extent,
came back in this project here.
You see this high\nvolume, two story volume.
What it does is basically\nit creates a stack effect.
So, the hot air goes up and\nit creates low pressure.
And what you'll see\nis the draft of air
is being created from all sides.
So then, the building is\nconstantly ventilated.
And ventilation, a\ndraft, is absolutely
necessary for the hot, humid\nclimate where we come from.
So, that's the basic\nsection of the building.
You see stacks of floors, quite\na very common section in Dhaka,
and that's where the\napartment was located.
That's the high volume.
And we tried to open\nup all the edges here,
so the air could make a move.
The quote from above.
And this, again,\nanother small project
to the outskirts of Dhaka,\nwhere we've used this nine
square grid plan.
And you see there's a\ncourtyard in the middle
and there are\ncourts on the sides.
And these are the\nbasic living areas.
There was a pond and a small\ncut that goes to the water.
The building, done in brick.
A very small, low-budget\nproject, as a weekend house.
And what you see here is those\ncourtyards, the corner courts
of the nine square plan.
And that's the court that\nbasically ventilates the spaces
and creates the draft of air.
And that's actually the\nmain shaft in the middle.
And on top, we have these\nopen pavilion-like spaces
where you can sit\nin the afternoon
and enjoy the surroundings.
So, as you just saw, brick is\nactually one of our materials.
Because, being a delta, we don't\nhave any other stone but brick.
So we have either to\nbuild with mud, mud
as you can see in the\nvernacular architecture,
or you can bake the mud and\nmake it brick and use it.
So, this is one of our\n16th century old monastery,
Buddhist monastery.
And in that time, brick\nwas the relevant material
for any kind of\npermanent construction.
These are temples,\nHindu temples, here.
And the terracotta also done\nexquisitely detailed in brick,
and then baked, created\ninto terracottas.
So, Brick construction is\na tradition that we have.
And you see here.
This is one of my\nprojects, also.
And these are the\nbrick masons or master
craftsman from the northern\npart of Bangladesh.
They are the best brick\nmasons that you can find.
And this guy is one of the\nAga Khan Award winners.
So, you'll see a lot of brick\nkilns in our entire landscape,
dotted with it.
And because they have\na high carbon emission,
one of the projects\nfrom UNDP was
to reduce this carbon\nemission, and to create
a new kind of\nhybrid Hoffman brick
kiln, which would\nreduce the carbon
emission into the atmosphere.
So, this is one of such kiln.
And one of my\nproject was to design
a small residential facility\nright next to the brick kiln,
to show that it does\nnot really emit as much.
And it really doesn't.
You don't see any\nsmoke coming out.
They have reduced the smoke\nby adding coal into the brick.
So, that really\nworks quite well.
So, I designed a\nsmall pavilion, which
was designed with the same idea\nof a brick kiln construction.
So, what you see here is\nthat capsule-like thing,
which is entirely made from\nthat construction technique.
And a residential, some sitting\narea courtyard in the middle.
This was what we had in mind.
And this went into\nconstruction halfway through,
it's still not complete\nyet, but hopefully we'll
be able to finish it soon.
So, handcrafting is an important\nphenomena which you see.
Because every building\nthat you see in
Bangladesh are all handcrafted.
There's rarely any\nmachine being used.
So, as such, handcrafting\nand the imperfection that
comes with it, is a quality.
It's something that\nneeds to be celebrated.
And, well, that's\nwhat you just saw.
Basically, this is\nwhat it turned into.
And these are one\nof such craftsmen
who work with their hands.
And our connection,\nspecially we architects,
when we work, you just\ndon't give a drawing
and ask them to build it, it has\nto be a connection with them,
almost like a family.
Because you have to explain, you\nhave to directly talk to them,
and then create\nsomething out of it.
There he is on the site.
And with his\nhandcrafting, you see
this is what he has created.
No machines, nothing.
Just pure, basic handcrafting.
And these are the kind of\ndrawings we generally give,
so you really see that\nthere are proper AutoCAD
drawings with dimensions.
But at times, you just\nhave to go to the site,
draw something,\nexplain it to them,
and that's how it gets built.
So, this is Dhaka.
The land here, you\nsee, that's Dhaka.
On two sides, there\nis low-lying water.
And in the south, we\nhave a river, Buriganga.
And on the north,\nthere is Turag.
You see, the Parliament Complex\nof Louis Khan is right there.
That's our airport.
And basically, all the\npink areas that you see
are absolutely dotted\nwith buildings.
So it's a densely-built\ncity, a mega-city
that's growing constantly.
A city of 16 million, and\nin 300 square meter of area.
So you see that the landscape\nof Dhaka, the cityscape.
So, it's about 45,000\npeople per square kilometer.
So, that's the\ndensity of Dhaka city.
And that's where I\nactually practice
and do my projects quite often.
Many of my projects are there.
So, that's quite a\nchallenge, actually,
when you work in a\nlandscape like that.
We don't have the luxury\nof building houses,
we only build apartments.
So that there is enough\npeople to abilitate.
So, what you see here,\nis a basic section
that you'll find anywhere.
When you get a project anywhere\nin the Dhaka cityscape,
these are the kind of sections.
You'll have a basement,\nto place your car,
and then there will\nbe a ground floor,
and then all the\nfloors are either
apartments, commercial blocks,\nor anything that comes with it.
One such project that I\ndid, was actually located
right at this point\nhere, which is
right next to the major\nspine, which goes north
and south of the Dhaka city.
This is one of the major spines.
That's the major spine of\nDhaka city, right here.
And you already see\nin the Google Image
that it's dotted with cars.
And it quite often remains\nabsolutely, completely
blocked with cars and traffic.
So, that was the\nsite, right here,
and it's an apartment\nbuilding, which
I knew that would never be\nused as an apartment building
because, though the land use\nplan tells us it has to be one,
and that's how we\ndesigned it also.
What we did was, basically,\nthat's the plan you see here.
The court in the middle, you\nhave the elevators and stairs,
and these are the two\napartments on two sides.
What we did was, we\nopened up the edges,
as I mentioned about the\npavilion apartment and the idea
of breathability, and\nhow you need to breathe,
make your space breathe.
We tried to open the\nedges on the sides
to let it have that airflow\nand the draft of air.
And that's the building, you\nsee the traffic jam is already
there.
And what we did is we\ncreated a facade, which
is more for the public.
So it's a public facade.
Which actually gives\nsomething back to the city,
and not entirely\nfor the apartment.
That's a developer-built\nproject, a real estate
development.
So that's the kind\nof image we created,
and that's the building.
This is a competition which was\nfor the Building Development
Authority.
Which we designed.
It is again, in the city.
You see the city on\nhere, that was the site.
And what was required, it's\nagain, another urban plot.
That's the plot we had.
And we were asked to\ndesign their office.
As the city is moving\ntowards north, it's growing.
So, they had their headquarters\nin the southern part,
and wanted to move to the north.
So what we did--
it was a competition where\nthey wanted their offices,
and also to take up\nas much built-up area
as are there, to give them\ncertain other different kinds
of use.
So we suggested a business\nhotel because in that location,
they really needed\nsomething of that sort.
So, this, what you\nsee here, is the plan.
So, we basically made\nfour built forms.
If I go to the next slide,\nyou'll probably see better.
So, this is where you enter.
And, first, we created a podium.
This is the parking\nin the underground.
Three basements.
And the way we did\nthe design was,
there were four blocks and a\npodium in the ground level.
And then, we cut the\nbuilding in a way
that allows the air to flow in.
And the depth of the\nbuilding was such
that you could have natural\nair and natural ventilation,
and light.
Into that space.
So, there was this shaft\nthat we had created.
These are the shafts\nthat take up the air.
And at the same time allows\nlight, natural light.
And you can see the cores.
And these are the offices.
This would be the\nbusiness hotel.
That's the basic section.
And that was the\ndesign we created.
That the building was actually\nshaping, in a certain way,
that it allows air to\nflow into that space.
Well, we did not\nwin, but I thought
of sharing because it was one\nof the large projects where
we have tried out this\nventilation shaft.
This project,\nwhich is absolutely
to the south of Dhaka.
You see this part?
This is the densest\narea in the whole city.
This is the river.
And around here, the\nmember of the Parliament
of this area, which is a client\nof mine, he's now the minister,
once gave me a\nphone call asking me
that he had this election\npledge of making a few community
centers and schools\nin this area.
And just gave me a\ncall and said, "Can you
give me a design very quickly?
I'll give you two weeks.
Come up with the design\nof a community center".
And, at times you\nhave to do some things
to satisfy your client.
So I said, "All right,\nI\'ll give you a design.
Send me the site".
So he sent me the site\nlocation and everything.
This was the site.
And it's entirely\nbuilt on the edges.
And it was a very basic program.
Just as some large, open\nspaces for different kind
of activities to take place.
So, we basically placed all\nthe services at the back,
and we left the\nmain spaces open.
So, these are the\nspaces that we had,
and the service at the back, and\nthe stair that takes people up.
The basic section.
An atrium.
And you have the floors.
And from the top.
This is the 3-D image that\nI gave him for his election.
And then, he won.
Not because of this\nimage, because he already
was quite popular in that area.
And after three\nyears, we get a phone
call that we need some details.
And then, I said,\n"What details?",
and then, "What details?
Well, we are building this\nproject, we need some details.
There\'s some missing".
And then, for the first time,\nwe heard that they've already
laid the foundation.
It was already on site.
The foundation was done.
And that was the\nfirst time I said,
"It was like a real disaster".
So we went, for the first\ntime, to see this site.
And there was this image\nin a large billboard
with my name on it.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
So you can imagine, I was\nalready famous in that area
because I was building\ntheir community center.
But I have never\nvisited the site.
So this is the\nfirst project ever
I've done where I\nhaven't been to the site.
But it's finally getting built.\nSo, that's where you see it.
That's the-- you see how densely\nbuilt the surrounding is.
And it's coming\ntowards completion now.
As it is still\nunder construction,
so the site is\npretty much there.
Another project,\nwhich I like to show
because it's one of\nmy very favorite ones
that I've ever designed.
Which is the French\nGerman Embassy.
So, in Dhaka, we have\nthis area which is
dedicated to all the embassies.
This one here is the American\nEmbassy, the Canadian Embassy
right next to it, that's\nthe British Embassy,
Chinese Embassy.
So, in between Chinese and\nThai Embassy, this is the area.
That land actually belongs\nto the French Embassy.
Germans do not have a land,\nso they came to a deal
that the Germans will\npay for the building,
and the French\nwill give the land.
So now, it's a\nFrench-German Embassy.
Which then went\ninto a competition.
And we were pre-selected\nof five different offices.
And the interesting thing\nis, since it's an urban site
and there is a\nsmall school behind,
then, as it's a very\nhigh-security area,
they needed 25 meter\nsetbacks from all sides.
So, what happened\nis, basically, we're
left with a very\nsmall footprint.
So, there is no way of making\ndistinctly different embassies
for the French and the Germans.
They have to be in one single\nbuilding in a small footprint.
So, that's what we worked on.
Basically, that's the\nschool back there.
And this is the 25 meter\nsetback from all sides.
This is the footprint\nthat you get.
And what we did was, we created\nan atrium in the middle.
Again, a small atrium.
And that's the square plan.
All the Passport section,\nthe cafeteria services,
are all on the sides.
But the main high-security\nzone was in the middle.
And what we did was\ncreated a central atrium,
and we cut the corners to allow\nthe light and the ventilation
to come through.
As this section.
And we won first prize for\nthis project, but later on this
was given to a French\narchitect to build.
So, that's a sad story.
OK.
So now, the next project.
Before moving into\nthe next project,
I'd like to give you a little\ndetail about Bangladesh's
history and how it\ncame into being.
This is the map of the Indian\nsubcontinent, as you can see.
And this map basically\nshows the Hindu population
and the density of\nHindu population.
And this image shows the\ndensity of Muslim population.
And you can see, this is\nthe densest Muslim area,
and these are the\ndensest Muslim areas.
So, based on these Hindu and\nMuslim density, to some extent,
the whole subcontinent was\ndivided into three parts.
So, one part, of course,\nwe know became India.
This and this together\nbecame Pakistan in 1947.
And, as you know\nin history, this
is one of the largest\nforced mass migrations
that took place when India\nand Pakistan was divided.
And Bengali was also divided.
Now, my family actually\ncomes from the other side.
So we had to move entirely\nto Bangladesh because
of our Muslim background.
And from 1947 to 1971,\nit was a struggle.
Because, though we had our\ncommon religion, the rest
of the things, like our\nculture or our language,
nothing really matched.
So there was always\na constant tension.
And finally, in 1971, Bangladesh\nor East Pakistan at that time,
wanted to become a free nation.
And that's then it\nturned into a revolution.
In a way, a struggle.
And that led to a war\nstarting from March 25th
to December 16th.
And it was an intense war where\nan enormous amount of life
was lost.
And this very ground, where this\nwhole event started and ended,
to some extent, is\nwhere my site is
located for the project of the\nMajor Museum of Independence
and the Independence Monument.
This image you see\nhere, this is the ground
where Sheikh Mujibur Raman, our\nFather of the Nation, actually,
gave the first speech where he\nsaid that we want to be free
and we want to be liberated.
And in 16th of December,\nthe Allied force,
Indian and Pakistani forces,\nin the same very ground,
actually, had this event of\nsurrender of the Pakistan
forces.
This is also a place\nwhere we have this--
It used to be horse\nracing ground.
So, this was actually a\npublic gathering area.
And even on our Occupy\nMovement, or any kind
of gathering that you see,\ntakes place right here.
So you see the amount\nof people that is there.
So, this site, which is\nactually located here.
Is one of the rare\ngreen areas that
is left in the city of Dhaka.
As you see, that it's\ndensely built all around.
That's our parliament\ncomplex, right there.
And this is probably one of\nthe last surviving green areas.
So, to build a\nmuseum and a monument
in a park, an existing park, did\nnot seem like the right thing
to do.
So, that was one challenge\nthat came with this project.
The other thing is\nthat it is actually
a ground which is surrounded\nby all different kinds
of cultural spaces.
Like we have our museum\nhere, the National Museum,
we have the public\nlibrary and all
these other different\nfunctions are located.
So, surrounding\nthis area would be
a lot of public and cultural\nactivities that takes place.
So, in that sense, it made\nsense to create something
in that space.
So what we did, actually,\nwas we took the smallest
footprint that is necessary for\nthat whole event to take place.
That's the design we did.
We had a water body, which is\na reflecting pool, and a plaza,
and a elliptical\nwalkway to go around
to have a view of that image.
So, that's our master plan.
So, this was an existing\npark that was there.
We created a connection between\nthis site and that site.
And a journey, you come\nhere and that's the plaza.
And basically-- so, this is the\nplan, actually, what you see.
The way we thought\nabout this design
was that we wanted to keep the\nhorizontal edge of the park.
So it does not visually\nbecome a building,
but it turns into a\nnon-building approach.
And we thought of this\nwhole design as a journey.
That you start your journey\nfrom here, you walk up,
there is a small monument\nto the 7th march,
and then there is this\nwater, a circular water
body that is actually\ncommemorating this nine month
long struggle and war.
And at the end is the tower.
And there is a wall\nthat guides you,
it takes you down\ninto the museum.
The reason for doing this\nis that the plaza would
be for celebration, any kind\nof celebratory activities
would be on the plaza.
Because, as we thought of, that\nthe freedom dream, aspiration,
has a preferred direction,\nwhich is upwards.
Anything that relates\nto infinity generally
takes an upward leap.
And, then again,\nmemory or sadness
always urges the subterranean.
So, we took the\nwhole, entire idea
of the museum, or the\nsadness or the history,
which we tried to\nembed into the ground.
So these are the different\nelements, as you see here.
That's the museum.
So, what happens if\nwe dig the ramp down.
First, is an audiovisual room.
You come down and then, these\nare the different museums
spaces.
That's the central water\nthat you see on top.
Becomes a central\nchamber down here.
And the museum below.
And it draws in a certain water.
The water actually\ncomes into this base
and becomes a column,\nor water column.
And then you go up\ntaking these ramps.
So, this project, which was\ncommissioned to us in 1998,
quite right after our\ngraduation from school,
took us 16 years to complete.
And finally with the tower,\nit was finished in 1993.
And since the build project was\nstalled over the period of time
because of the government\ninterest in the project or not,
it has those signs.
As you can see, it bears the\nsigns of this long struggle
of its own building process.
And one other thing that\nthe government never
made an initiative,\nof collecting
all the documents of the war.
So, what we had is just images.
So we imprinted the\nimages on the glass
and created this\nwhole space entirely
made up of the art of images\nof the whole event of war.
And that's the\ncentral chamber, where
we don't have any exhibit,\nbut just a water column.
One should just stand there\nand remember the people
who were lost in the war.
And then, you come out and\nbasically, with the ramp,
you go out into the plaza.
I have this small\nvideo I would like to--
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[WATER FALLING]
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
So, as you go up\ninto the plaza, you
see the Independence Monument.
And the Independence Monument,\nthe way we thought of,
is a tower of light.
So, the Tower of light, the\nbest expression of freedom
we thought would be light.
And the way we designed\nit was a tower, which
was made out of glass.
And glass was not used like\na panel or a sheet of glass,
but glasses were stacked\non top of another
and it created a panel.
And as you see here,\nthese are the panels
of single-panel, which\nhad thick glass layered
on top of another.
And it was clad onto\nthe space rim structure.
This is where you see, here.
Right here you see the panels\nand the thickness of it.
And it's clad on\nto a space frame.
The reason was, we\nwanted the light
to be refracted\nduring the daytime,
so there is refraction of light.
And that's why it\ncreates a certain kind
of prismatic effect.
And in the evening, this is the\ntower, which is 150 feet tall.
And in the evening, it's\nlit artificially with light,
so that it is basically a\nglowing light, tower of light,
which is a beacon of hope\nfor this young nation, which
is Bangladesh.
And this is the 16th of\nDecember, our Victory Day
celebration, where you\nsee people being gathered
and the celebration\ntakes place on the plaza.
So, this is the city of Dhaka.
And, in a way, one thing\nthat I have found out,
my way of approaching\narchitecture in the city
is to bring order into chaos.
And, in many ways,\nthat's what I try
to do with all the different\nprojects that I've showed you.
And the other thing, what I'm\nworking on in two or three
different projects\nat the moment, where
I'm trying to introduce\nthis whole idea
of a sense of ownership.
And, in many ways, the Mosque\nproject is one such project.
So, I'll be showing\nyou the Mosque, here.
So, here is the city\nof Dhaka, as you see.
That's where the\nMosque is located.
This is the absolute end of the\ncity limit, marked by a river.
And that's the other end.
And the Mosque, here,\nwhich used to be
an absolute farmland,\nand not within the city
limits of Dhaka.
And if you see the images\nhere, 2004 to 2015,
how the whole area is\nslowly getting urbanized.
And its landscape\nin transformation.
It's constantly\ntransforming from farm land
into urban settlements.
And that's my grandmother,\nwho actually commissioned me
to this project.
The family owned some\nland in this area.
And as the city was\ngrowing towards that edge,
and there were\nsettlements being created,
there was no facilities\nbeing provided.
So, she decided to\ndonate part of her land
to build this Mosque.
And this, you see here, that's\nour first groundbreaking
ceremony.
And you see her sitting there.
And at that time, it was\nstill very village atmosphere
with farmland all around.
But as we started construction\nfrom 2008 onwards,
it slowly became more urbanized.
So, as I got the project from\nmy grandmother with a small sum
of money to initiate\nthe project,
I started looking into the\nwhole history of Mosque,
and how it came into being.
And if you see, Mosque, how\nit was initiated in Islam,
it was basically--
you see here, that's the first\nMosque form, which is actually
built out of a house form.
So, house form was\ndeveloped into a Mosque.
So, initially, it had never\nany kind of symbolic elements
that we generally identify\nourselves with Mosque.
It was basically a space, which\nis a space for congregation,
where people would gather to\nsay a congregational prayer.
And it was not only used\nas a space for prayer,
but also for other\nactivities that took place.
It was a space for\nadministrative activities,
it was judiciary, it was\ncommunal, social, so all kind
of activities used to\ntake place in the Mosque.
And slowly over history,\nthese activities
have been separated\nor taken out,
and slowly, it just\nturned into a place
where people worshipped.
So, in a way, I thought,\nin a place like Bangladesh,
where you do not get\nfacilities, and you are just
getting a space, to only use\nthat for prayer would not
be the right thing to do.
So I decided, in a\nway, that this space
should be not only\nused as a prayer space,
but also would encourage\nother form of activities
in that location.
And, of course, in\nterms of architecture,
we see the wonderful\nlegacy that is there
in the Islamic history.
The Mosque of Cordova.
Hagia Sophia, though it's\nnot a Mosque, basilica.
But then again, the\nspiritual character
of the space and\nthe light is just
enormously inspiring for me.
And if you look into my\nlandscape, which is in Bengal,
you'll see these\nbeautiful Mosques
from the sultanate period,\nfrom the 13th to 14th century
Mosques, when Islam\nactually came to Bengal.
And at that time, these Mosques\nwere the first, let's say,
authentic Mosque form that\nyou find in our country,
or in our landscape.
And this is the situation of\nMosques now, in Bangladesh.
It's just basically\nstacks of floors.
It has entirely lost its\nmorphology or typology,
however you want to put it.
It's just not there anymore.
It's invisible.
And, see what happened\nto the symbols.
So, as if to have a Mosque, you\nmust have these little things,
however you put it.
So, that's what I\nwanted to address.
That you don't really\nneed these elements.
And so, in a way,\nextracting what
is essential from the earlier\nMosques, which were actually
the authentic Mosque\nform, to coming
to a Mosque which is much more\nof a contemporary expression.
And if you see\nhere, these images I
find quite interesting.
Taken from a book, {} number\nthat was compiled with old
architecture of Bangladesh.
This, here, you\nsee the monastery
that I showed you earlier.
A Buddhist monastery.
This is a Hindu temple that's\nthe sultanate buried Mosque.
And that's our\nparliament building.
So, all different religion,\nincluding the democracy
is a religion, this\nis what you get.
And basically, this is what\nI came up with, as a concept.
That we had all\nthe, I would say,
the additional or extra\nfacilities on all these areas.
And then, I introduced\na circular form in a way
to facilitate this whole\nrotation of the prayer hall,
because, as you\nknow, Muslims pray
in a certain direction,\nwhich is to Kaaba.
So, that's the\nqibla, we call it.
So to enhance that\nqibla, I had to introduce
this circular volume here.
And to make that rotation\nof the prayer hall.
And all the edges that\nyou see around here
are open to sky,\nto let the air flow
and to have the entire\natmosphere open.
These are the\ndifferent drawings.
So, as you enter from this side,\nthese are the entrance court.
From there, you basically don't\nenter into the prayer hall
immediately.
You turn, either from\ncoming here and then taking
that route.
Or you could come from here.
Or you could go and\ndo the ablution,
which is this area,\nwashing, and then you
can come from that side.
So, that's how the whole\nentire thing was designed.
And one thing I must\nmention is the fact
that the project was\nbuilt entirely with money
generated from the community.
So, everybody\nliving in that area,
they are basically lower\nmiddle-income families.
So, they basically gave\nwhatever amount of fund
they could possibly give,\nor in whatever form.
In a way, I encouraged\nthat in this whole project,
because it was important to\ncreate this sense of ownership.
That once you have that,\nonce I've built this project
and I'm out of that,\nthey need to maintain it.
So, if there is not\na sense of ownership,
this will never be\nmaintained properly.
So that's why it was\nimportant to engage them.
And in a way, that\nengagement actually helped.
And since it was built\nwith their money.
I had to be really,\nvery responsible
about the resources I had.
So this entire area,\nwhich is holding
all the different\nfunctions and facilities,
are built with brick.
Entirely load-bearing brick\nstructure with perforation
to enhance the airflow.
And in the central space,\nwhich is the prayer hall,
is the only space\nwhich is in concrete
because it had to be a\ncolumn-free and large space.
So, you see here in this\nimage, how the whole area is
transforming slowly.
With new buildings coming up.
The landscape which used to be\nfarmland is not there anymore.
And that's the building,\nwithin its landscape.
So, you don't see any symbolic\nelements in this building.
You don't see the\ndome or the minaret.
As I wanted to create that\nconnection of reviving
this whole notion\nof the Mosque to be
used as all other different\nkind of activities.
That was the reason\nwhy I initially
decided not to encourage\nthis whole idea of symbolism
into the architecture.
That's the entrance.
That's one side.
And these are the\nchildren who actually
learn to read Quran,\nalso in that same space.
You see the side,\nopen to sky spaces
from where you get the\nlight, and also helps
with the ventilation.
Also with the acoustics.
And during the day, this\nis how the light basically
comes through.
Since we did not have any\nbudget to have it ornate,
we thought of using light\nto ornate need the building.
Light is for free, and it\ndid not cost us anything.
So, it's all the\ndifferent kind of light
and the play of\nlight in that space.
That's the prayer.
And this is very recently,\nwhen we had sort of an Aga Khan
celebration.
With all the community.
Everybody was there, so we had\na nice lunch in that space.
You see the children who\nactually learn Quran.
And there, everybody\nelse from the community.
And it was a wonderful feast.
You see Farook there.
Farook was there to celebrate.
And, yeah.
So, we've basically\ntransformed the space.
And then, this idea\nall of a sudden,
came of, why don't we\nuse it for weddings?
There is not enough\nspace in that location
to have wedding facilities,\nso why not a wedding?
So, yeah.
So, that's how we'll slowly\nstart using that space
more than just for prayer.
And for other things, too.
One last project,\nand then I'm done.
So, basically,\nthis project, where
we've tried to address this\nissue of pride of place,
wisdom of the land, and\nminimal intervention,
it's a resort to the\nsouthern part of Bangladesh.
This is south of Bangladesh.
You see it's almost\nlike a painting.
This is the Bay of Bengal.
And this dark area that you\nsee, is the mangrove forest,
the largest mangrove\nforest, Sundarbans.
And that's where the royal\nBengal tigers actually
come from.
So, my client, who has\nthis land right up here,
decided to make this resort.
Which is absolutely in\nthe delta farm land.
The idea was to celebrate the\ndelta, and the life and living,
and the authentic\nexperience of Bangladesh.
And to bring people from\nthe site to the Sundarbans
through the river ways.
And people could come\nand spend some time
and go back to the resort.
So, that's the site right here.
You see how beautifully green,\nand all entirely farm land.
And that's the river, which\nis called Phataker and then
there's another river which is\nvery narrow, goes through here.
And that's the site\nwhere we were to work on.
And from the side, this\nis the view you get.
It's absolute farmland.
And there's a bridge\nright across here.
And surrounding the site,\nare all these fields
of [INAUDIBLE], and\nthis is our winter,
where you see the mustard\nseeds become absolutely yellow.
And this is a very,\nvery fertile area,
from where all\nkinds of vegetables
grows everywhere\naround Bangladesh.
So, Bangladesh is basically\nfed from this land.
So, in that sense, it's an\nimportant and unique landscape.
And once you get\nout of Dhaka, it's
really a very\ndifferent landscape.
Life is slow-paced.
And everything is so much\nmore natural and so different,
that I, at times,\nfeel like a foreigner
when I go to the\nvillages myself.
So, in a landscape\nlike this, how
do you build with the kind\nof architectural education
that I was educated with?
Does it really give me\nthat kind of knowledge
to go and build something there?
That's where my dilemma\nwas with this project.
And that's why it\nwas very difficult
for me to even draw a line.
How do I address this?
What do you do?
Because the moment\nyou build something,
you immediately disrupt the\nwhole dynamics of that place.
So, that became a kind of a\nchallenge in this project.
So this is what I\nwrote to my client.
"Rural Bangladesh is\nuniquely beautiful,
the soul of the delta land.
It feels like a crime to invade\nthe silence with the roaring
noise of architecture.
This project gives\nan opportunity
to bring back the\nlost pride, and belief
in the wisdom of the land.
Crafted over hundreds of years\nof dwelling in the delta".
And so, what we did was,\nwe started a research,
and we had some wonderful\ninterns from the Cornell
University, who went and\nstayed there the whole summer
and helped us with this\nwhole process of research.
What's interesting in\nbuilding in the delta
is that the first\nconstruction is to dig a pond.
So, you dig a pond, you dig the\nearth out, you create a mound.
And on the mound, basically\nyou place you in buildings.
What you see here,\nyou dig a pond,
the earth goes up here,\nit creates a mound,
so that, when it rains, the\nwater goes into the pond again.
And on that, you\nplace your small huts.
And that's absolutely ingenious.
That's all you need,\nbasically, to build there.
This is one of the\nvillages, which
was right across our site.
And this is the village\nthat they actually
made an extensive study on.
What you see here are the\nhuts, these are the huts.
Small huts.
And these huts are actually\nenclosing a courtyard.
It's not a distinctly\ndemarcated courtyard,
but there's a notion of a\nspace, and the space basically
flows from one to the other.
And that's how it's\ncreated all over.
That's the construction.
You see thatch roof\nand mud buildings.
And this is how it's built\nentirely in that landscape.
So, mud architecture with mud\nwalls, and either tiled roofs,
or thatch roof.
And if you look into\nthe architecture,
and this is one thing\nI try to also dig again
into the history, to look into\nwhat we had in the vernacular.
Basically, this is\na roof form which
is known as the bangla roof.
And from bangla comes\nthe word "Bungalow",
and that's something the British\nbrought out of that location.
So, this bangla roof is\na very unique roof form,
from our delta.
And this form was\nalso taken by Akbar
in the Mughal architecture.
And you see that also in our\ntemples, which were recreated.
But this is something\nwhich is now lost.
You don't see that anymore.
So, I thought this could\nbe a thing of revival
in a contemporary manner.
And this is the idyllic\nimage of a village home
in [INAUDIBLE] in Bangladesh.
So that is something which\nis, I found, quite unique,
as well to work with that.
These are the pallet of things\nthat we found in the landscape.
The colors, the textures.
So, that's how it all began.
So, that's our site.
We had a roadway that\nwould bring our goods
to the back of house facility,\nwhich we decided to place here.
And people would\ncome from down here.
This is where the\ncar would stop.
And they would take a boat\nride and come to the site,
enjoying this whole\nwater scenario.
And the resort itself\nis called Panigram.
Pani means water,\nGram means village.
So, it's a water village idea.
So, this was my initial plan.
Before I started\nwith the site, I
had to show something to the\nclient, so this is what I did.
And after we've\ndone the study, this
is what it sort of turned into.
What we did was, we\ncreated these huts
that would be resorts.
So, you have room\nfor a bathroom.
And these are all\nplaced in a certain way
that the space flows\nfrom one to the other.
So, you see the plan here.
These are all 30-inch\nthick mud structures.
And with thatch roof.
And another issue\nthat we tried out
on this project, which\nis working out really
well is, again, this whole\nidea of sense of ownership
and including the villagers\nin this whole project.
So this boy, who is from\nthis village, potter's son.
And generally, a boy\nof his age has always
the dream of going to the\ncity and starting a job,
taking some kind of a job,\nand then just, in a way,
getting lost or out of\nthis whole landscape.
So, what we try to do is\nengage them in this project,
in different capacity.
So this is his household.
And that's the pottery village.
So, you see that's\nwhat his family does.
And that's the village\nthat he's from.
That's his grandfather.
Making pottery.
So that's the boy.
We basically tried to engage\nhim and we started giving him
the job of whatever we needed.
And he has no knowledge\nof making pottery,
so he went back\nto his grandfather
and there was a connection.
Again, created that actually\ngot lost because of the fact
that he was not interested\nin the skill anymore.
So, that is something\nwhich is really unique.
This is our construction.
You see, we are using\nbasically sun-dried mud bricks,
taken from the kilns\nbefore they're fired.
So, these bricks are brought in.
That our plaster, mud plaster.
And that's how its\nconstruction is getting done.
The roof.
And the whole\nproject is entirely
being built by the villagers.
So all the villagers are there.
And they are building\nthe whole thing.
That's our thatched roof.
Our roof consultant.
That's our organic\nfarm consultant.
Our plaster consultant.
And that's the\nconsultants in a meeting.
So, this is the project.
I don't know if you would call\nit architecture, because I
go there, and I just go\nto the villages houses
and have a nice feast.
And the rest of the\nproject is entirely
being built by the locals.
I don't know if you'll\ncall it architecture,
we could have a debate on this.
But, to me, at this\npoint, in that location,
this seems to be\nthe right answer.
[RAIN SOUNDS]
So, that's the monsoon.
And I'll end it here\nwith this monsoon rain.
Thank you.
[AUDIENCE CLAPS]
Would you mind some\nquestions and comments?
No, not at all.
So, Marina has agreed to take\nsome question or comments.
Maybe I could just start--
Absolutely.
Maybe-- can I get a mic?
So, this last point about the\nrespect for indigenous building
techniques.
I mean, you started with\nthe respect for brick.
And, for a lot of\nthe early projects,
I was just comfortable\nin the idea
that the brick techniques,\nfrom making the brick,
to laying the brick,\nand even the forms,
were hundreds of\nyears, centuries old.
But then, when you got\nto the monument in glass.
And, in a way, the\ntower was not high-tech,
but it was certainly,\nit seems to me,
pushing beyond what any\ncrafts person would do.
And then, I became\nmore attentive.
And by the time we were at the\nMosque, which is, again, brick,
and in some photographs\nlooks completely
blended in with the village.
In others, there seemed to me\nto be the tales and brick laying
techniques that are\nnot traditional at all.
And so, and then, we come\nto that last project.
And so, I'm trying\nto understand,
when do you push the tradition?
When do you try to\nmake, as it were
the bricklayer's, innovate?
When do you pull back?
Do they go with you\nin the innovation?
Or do they resist?
Could you talk a\nlittle bit about how
those kinds of\ndecisions are made.
Well, basically every\nproject is different, right?
So, every project comes with\na very different challenge.
With the site,\nlocation, the program.
So, every project is\na different research
into the different morphology,\ntypology, however you call it.
And, so, based on that research,\nlike in the Mosque, of course,
we had this whole idea of taking\nthe essence from the past.
Sort of extracting what\nis essential of a Mosque,
and to take that, and give\nit a contemporary, much more
contemporary expression.
And contemporary\nmeaning contemporary
in Bangladeshi landscape,\nnot in a world scene.
Contemporary which is possible\nwith the craftsmanship
of the hand that is being\nproduced in that location.
So, that's how I try to work.
And, well, definitely, as\nyou've seen in the brick--
in the Mosque\nproject, we've tried
to create this perforation.
And it had to be a lot\nbetter in structure,
which is about 25 feet high.
This whole brick work we tried\nout a few different options.
So, it's always done on site.
So, we have the brick masons.
I tell them, "Let\'s\ndo it this way".
So, at times, we bring\nin brick in the office.
Or at times we do it on site.
So, we build it to\na certain extent
to see how it works, whether\nit resists rain water,
does it let it flow in?
So, those kind of\nexperiments we do.
And making samples is very,\nvery necessary, definitely.
And with the mud architecture.
The mud one was the\nmost difficult for us
because we did not use the local\ntechnique of mud construction.
Because if you go with that,\nand with such a big project,
it would not be feasible.
Then it would take 10,\n15 years to build it.
Because it goes very slow.
And we had to employ someone\nwho can build it fast,
who has the knowledge\nof brick construction.
So, in a way, it's mud\nbrick construction.
So, it's again, that\nbrick construction,
but done in a very\ndifferent way.
So, that also needed a\nlot of experimentation.
So, how much you can\nbuild with mud brick,
and whether it\nbreaks or not, when
to plaster it, how much moisture\nshould retain in the bricks
so that when you plaster,\nit does not crack.
So, there are a lot of small\ninnovations and research
that goes into that\nproject as well.
And if you see the tower\nthat is made out of glass.
We never call it glass tower,\nwe call it tower of light.
So, light, definitely, you\ncannot build with light,
but to bring in the effect of\nlight, glass became our medium.
And even the glass was stacked.
So, in a way, that's\nalso brick in many ways.
So, I think that actually works.
You can find a certain kind\nof similarity in all of that.
So, questions, comments?
Thank you, Mrs. Tabassum.
That was a truly\nimpressive presentation.
Thank you.
And you took me away\nto my childhood.
I'm originally from the\nland of Rumi, from Konya.
The city of Konya, in Turkey.
And I went back to\nthose brick kilns.
How people actually\nput that into form.
How they were baked, and\nhow they were taken out.
That was beautiful.
Thank you.
And I've never\nbeen to Bangladesh,
but I was impressed with the\nenvironment, with the nature,
there.
But I have one\ntechnical question.
And one, maybe a sort of\nphilosophical question, maybe.
The technical question is\nthat those white spans,
where you don't use the\ncolumns and then the Mosque.
Do you use post-tensioning\ntechniques, there?
No.
It's basically beam\nand column structure.
Beam and columns.
OK.
The architecture and\nthe symbolic parts
of a Mosque, the minarets.
Well, I think they're important\nbecause I see the minarets
as the lighthouses.
Lighthouses, you know, in\nthe sea, they guide you.
And whenever I go around,\nif it's time for a prayer,
I look for a minaret\nbecause they're higher up.
And spiritually,\nthey also guide you.
So was there any react--
I'm not reacting, I respect\nyour design and everything.
I thought it was a great,\nmulti-purpose sort of Mosque
there.
But was there any reaction\nto having your Mosque
without the minaret?
Well, in Ottoman Mosques,\nyou already always
had this idea of minarets like,\nfrom the Ottoman times, right?
Yes.
These Mosques that we've seen.
Beautiful Mosques that\nyou have in Turkey.
I love the Mosques.
I've been to many of those.
And I think that's a\nvery unique feature.
But when I see Ottoman\nMosques being replicated.
Let's say in Dubai or in\nAbu Dhabi, or even in Dhaka,
or Bangladesh.
This doesn't seem like\nthe right thing to do.
If you've seen our old Mosques\nin the Sultanate period,
there were no minarets.
It was just a regular Mosque.
OK.
We never had minarets.
And if you look into even\nin the Arabian Peninsula,
all the Mosques that\nyou see, starting
from Saudi Arabia to\nall the early Mosques,
because I did a study on\nthe Mosques of the Arabian
Peninsula, the early Mosques.
Which actually became a document\nfor the Abu Dhabi Mosque
Development\nRegulation Guideline.
And at that time,\nalso, it really
helped me to see the\nentire early Mosque
scenario in that area.
And you'll see, rarely,\nyou find minarets.
Dorms there were none.
Except for one small Mosque,\nwhich was made out of mud,
but it was built when the\nTurkish came and built it.
So they had these small domes.
Otherwise, they were\nall flat Mosques.
So, there was no dome.
But there was, at times,\nyou'd find minarets.
Which are stout.
And very tiny, small minarets.
In Bangladesh, we\nnever had that.
But later on, as\nit was a demand.
To identify, as I mentioned,\nwith this whole notion
of these forms that it came in.
I did-- there were,\nfrom the community,
they wanted to have a minaret.
But then, we went to do\nthe debate of why would you
need a minaret.
Except for the fact that,\nas you mentioned that,
it acts to identify\nthat there is a Mosque.
In a way, in Dhaka,\nyou don't need that,
because people generally\nknow where their Mosques are,
because they are going\nthere almost regularly.
On a regular basis.
And, if not, then you always\nfind the Mosque somewhere.
It's a city of Mosques.
There are numerous\nMosques, there.
And one thing is,\nas I mentioned,
that we did not, of\ncourse, have the fund
to build a beautiful minaret,\neven if we wanted to.
But the idea was that\nwhen you call for prayer,
there is the sound.
So, the sound goes everywhere.
Do we really need a\nminaret in that sense?
When we could use that\nmoney to do something else.
Do I really need to\nbuild another form, which
is really not that necessary.
Because minarets were\nfor the whole idea
of the sound of the call\nfor prayer to go around.
That was the original idea\nwhy it came into being.
But now, with the kind\nof sound systems we have,
you don't really need that.
So, that was the\ndilemma where we
decided that we don't needed.
Thank you very much.
In fact, I agree with you 100%.
When you go to the--
I love the Sinai style Mosque.
But when you go to Qatar,\nor Abu Dhabi, Dubai,
it doesn't really fit.
Absolutely, it doesn't fit.
One of my companies, a\nconstruction company.
We'll just finish our\nfifth Mosque in Qatar,
in the Salwa Beach Resort, OK?
And I really would like to\ntalk to you about your designs.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Thank you so much,\nit was wonderful.
Yay!
I got a job.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Other comments or questions?
Hi.
Thanks, very much.
I noticed in the\npicture of the Mosque,
where you were using it for\nthe Aga Khan celebration,
that people had their shoes off.
And was interested in, as\nyou think about using it
for a wedding or\nfor other spaces,
are you running into issues\nwith how people use a Mosque
or is that problematic at all?
And then, to draw that\nquestion more broadly,
as you push traditional\nbricklaying techniques
or traditional\narchitecture methods,
do you get any sort of\npush-back from craftsmen
or local traditions that are\nseeing a change that they're
not used to?
And if you do, then,\nhow do you deal with it?
Well, we haven't\nhad a wedding yet,
but I'm sure women will come\nin their high heels and saris.
We'll have to find a way.
Maybe we could have carpets.
I don't know.
Only for that purpose.
And then, later on,\nyou could take it out.
I'm sure we could come\nup with something.
But I'm not pushing it, yet.
Let's see.
We have to go slow, you know?
About the brick techniques\nor any kind of material
that we work with,\nit's basically
working with the\nmasons or those who
are actually working in that.
So, I'm not a mason.
I do not know how\nbrick would react.
I can only give certain\nhypotheses, perhaps.
But it's always\nworking with them.
That's why it's very\nimportant, the relationship
that we create with the\nperson who's building it.
I'm just drawing a line.
He's making that wall.
So, he's the more important\nperson than me, actually.
So, that's why\nit's very important
that this relationship.
So, in that way, we,\nwhatever idea we have,
we basically give it to them.
They give us their feedback.
Yes, it's possible.
Yes, it might\nwork, may not work.
And then, of course, the\nengineers also get involved.
So, it's almost like a teamwork\nof architect, engineer,
and the workmen or the\nmasons, or whoever.
The craftsmen, I would say.
So it's a teamwork.
And that's how it gets done.
I've never seen any\npush-back in that sense.
Not really.
No.
People like innovation.
And if it's done, I\nmean, a brick wall
could be laid just a regular\nbrick in a normal fashion,
or you could create something\nwhich actually gives you much
more than just a brick wall.
It could be a breathing wall.
It could be a lot\nof different things.
So then, that's a small\ninnovation, but changes a lot.
So, I think when you do\nthat, people appreciate.
It's never, I've found any kind\nof push-back in that sense.
Maybe I can get in with just\nasking you to educate us
a little bit more about what's\ngoing on now in Bangladesh.
You put yourself in a\nnumber of traditions.
I mean, I was always\nimpressed that you
do a lot of historical work,\nbut you also place yourself,
it seems to me, in a\ntradition of modernism
where geometrical organizations,\nthe nine square grid
appears a lot, the circle, where\ngeometrical organizations are
also at work and mixing\nwith the tradition.
And the closer you\nlook, and as you work,
the later work is even\nmore, I would say,
more personal, I think,\nthan the early work.
Is this part of a general\ntrend of a new generation
of architects in Bangladesh?
Is your work or are there\nother people doing such work?
Or are there different\ntrends emerging just
in general, how a younger\ngeneration is practicing now
in Bangladesh?
I can talk about those who\nare contemporary to me.
There are quite a few\narchitects who are working--
I mean, you know that we have\na tradition, our architecture,
modernist architecture\nwas established
by Muzharul Islam in the 1950s.
And, in a way, to\nsome extent I would
say that we are\nbasically following
that same legacy in many ways.
After Muzharul Islam,\nthere was Kazi, Zaif.
With Muzharul Islam, they formed\nthis group called Chetana.
And from Chetana,\nthey made a number
of really unique\nbeautiful publications.
And, in a way, that is\nalso another generation who
has immense respect,\nhave shown respect
for the local architecture.
Much, much more rooted there.
And I think our generation is,\nto some extent, from that time
it's much more in\na contemporary way
coming out with another kind\nof architecture language.
But I think its there is a\ncertain kind of continuity.
And it's not only me, of course.
We have quite a\nfew architects who
are doing tremendously,\nreally good work.
And, as you mentioned earlier,\nthat we have this Bengal
Institute, which we formed very\nrecently, and through this,
we are trying to engage\nyoung architects, which
I think is very necessary\nnow in Bangladesh.
That we engage\nthese young minds.
With different kind of\nmultidisciplinary architectural
ideas.
And engage them not only\nin buildings, but also
to develop the\nwhole environment.
So, that's also something\nwe are working on.
So, there are a lot\nof young architects.
Especially awards like\nthis Aga Khan Award.
actually helps.
And not for me, but for\nthe younger generation
in many ways, it's a\nvery encouraging thing.
Yeah.
Thanks.
What about female\narchitects [INAUDIBLE]
Well, we have about\n2000 architects who
are registered as architects.
And among them, I would say,\nat least 40% are female.
So, we have a huge female\narchitecture professionals.
But in practice, you don't see\nmany of them coming like me,
let's say.
The number wouldn't\nbe too many, who is
running an office on their own.
So, that is something lacking.
But I think that's\nsomething really to work on.
Because, if you go into\nthe schools of architecture
these days, you'll see 50%\nof women, 50% are male.
In fact, at times, male\nis less, and more females.
So, it's turning into a\nfemale profession, slowly.
Especially in Bangladesh's case.
So, I think it's important that\nwe kind of try to engage them
more into the practice, rather\nthan just working in offices.
That's very important.
Otherwise, at one point, we'll\nend up with no practitioners
anymore.
That would be really something.
Yeah.
Maybe we can convince\nMarina that this
won't be her last time.
And she can come as a role\nmodel for future practitioners.
So, warmly ask her to\nreturn and thank her.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
