Good evening.
Thank you all very\nmuch for coming.
It's really\nwonderful to see such
a great, large, enthusiastic,\nsmiling group of people.
The last couple of weeks\nhave been really wonderful
in the school--
really a great set of lectures.
It was special to hear Luisa\nLambri and last night Tomas
Koolhaas with the film.
And of course\ntonight, with Rahul,
I think it's a really great\ncombination of presentations.
Rem will actually be\nhere in person on Monday
to present his studio.
And we will have\nIwan Baan on Tuesday.
And there's actually a\nGSD event in Chicago,
for those of you who\nare there, on Thursday.
And the following week,\nSimon Allford, Clare Lyster,
Mason White, and a number\nof faculty and students
will also participate at\nan event on October 3rd,
so lots of things\nto look forward to.
When you consider the\nwork of most architects
or urban designers, there\nis often a great deal
of consistency in the work.
You see work that has\noften a great deal
of stylistic similarity.
Of course, in the work\nof Rahul Mehrotra,
there's also a lot\nof consistency.
But it's interesting\nwhen you see
this amazing, beautiful\nexhibition that's
out there put together\nby Rahul, his team, Dan
Borelli, and others\nfrom the GSD,
to see that there is a body of\nwork that starts with toilets
in the slums to a\nproject for housing
elephants to\nconservation projects,
including those\nfor the Taj Mahal,
to a building in a small\nSwiss city for Novartis,
and a new library for the campus\nof his own alma mater at CEPT
in Ahmedabad.
There is, in a way, a\nphenomenal diversity
and incredible breadth of work\nthat in many respects makes
Rahul India's contemporary\nversion of the Renaissance man,
I think, with all these\nthings that you're doing.
In addition to all\nthese projects,
Rahul is working as an\narchitect, as a planner,
as a conservation consultant,\nan academic, and author.
And the combination of all\nthese different talents,
these different\ninterests, I think,
are very much in evidence in\nthe exhibition, which is also
named "Soft Thresholds."
Apart from, in a\nsense, transcending
the boundaries between\nthese different activities
and different disciplines,\nthese kinds of expertise,
in many ways, it seems\nthat the soft thresholds
of the exhibition\nis also a threshold
across different disciplines,\ndifferent cultures, religions,
issues of legality.
And in some sense,\nthis idea of working
across these\ndifferent disciplines
has been at the\nheart of what I think
Rahul has done during the\ntime that he's been here
at the GSD as a professor in\nthe Department of Urban Planning
and Design, as the chair of\nthe department, what he did,
and to really utilize\nthis collaboration
between the various\nactivities of the school,
but also of the\nuniversity, working
with a number of colleagues.
We have Professor\nTarun Khanna here.
He's worked with Professor\nDiana Eck on the Kumbh
Mela and other things\nto actually continue
this work of friendship, of\ncollaboration with many people,
And of course his significant\npedagogic research on questions
of urbanization under the rubric\nof extreme urbanism, which
has been in progress\nfor the last few years.
I'm really delighted that we\nhave Rahul Mehrotra among us
and that he is now back after a\nwonderful sabbatical year, full
of energy, full of\nverve, ready to continue
all his research, his\npedagogy, and to be amongst us,
and for us to really benefit\nfrom all his foresight.
So, please welcome\nRahul Mehrotra.
[applause]
Thank you very much, Mohsen.
That was a very kind\nand lovely introduction.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
And good evening.
And thank you all for being\nhere for this lecture.
For me, it's a real honor\nto be speaking to you
but also exhibiting the work\nhere at the GSD gallery.
I graduated exactly\n30 years ago.
And so, the process of\nputting together this show
has been one of introspection,\nreflection, and also emotional.
Because essentially what the\nexhibition for me captures
is what I feel were the most\nimportant or relevant things
that I engaged with\nin the last decades.
I'm also very happy\nthat a number of people
here in the audience\ntoday have been
part of these conversations\nand supported these efforts
through the decades.
So, thank you all.
For the exhibition, I\nwant to just take a minute
to thank the GSD, to\nMohsen in particular,
for having supported\nthis effort.
It's a huge support.
And particularly\nto Dan and David
for their amazing team\nand the tremendous effort
and commitment they put into\nmake these exhibitions happen.
One sees them emerging,\nbut one doesn't
realize what goes behind them.
To Kate, who lead\na team of students
to work with Dan,\n[inaudible],, Ruben, and Yuan,
and the installation team,\nwhich again, you know,
one sees in the gallery\nevery two months
people who look like artists,\nvery committed, making things,
and they disappear and these\nwonderful things emerge.
But they were really a\nwonderful set of people,
and I really thank them all.
And Maggie, lastly, who captured\nand edited my interviews
on these video installations\nthat she's done,
which were a fantastic\nprocess for me.
And she just did an amazing job.
So, thank you all.
The last time I\nspoke here at the GSD
in the Piper a year ago--
and I think some\nof you were here--
I focused on cities\nand urban design.
And this time I focused,\nwhen speaking to Mohsen
about the exhibition,\non architecture,
but of course with its\nintersection with the city.
And that\'s why I\'ve called\nit "Working in Mumbai--
Soft Thresholds" as the\ntitle of the exhibition.
Because the city is\ntruly, I believe,
born on my approach and\nvalues and the values that
are brought to\nbear, so to speak,
on the practice, the profession,\nthe craft of architecture.
From the time I worked\nhere on my thesis--
this is my MAUD thesis, '87,\nwith Professor Peter Rowe--
now coming back\nhere to teach for me
has yet kept the city really\nomnipresent in my references,
pursuits as an architect,\nand as a teacher.
Sometimes in tangible ways\nwhen one is engaged directly
with this as a site\nof our operation,
as a studio instructor.
But in other times, the\npresence of the city
has somehow been intangible,\nimplicit perhaps.
And so today I'm going\nto share with you some
of what this relationship with\nthe city, my city of Mumbai,
has come to influence in\nterms of my own production
as an architect\nworking in India,
and influenced our concerns\nand engagements, which
are sort of triangulated between\nthe practice of architecture,
urban design conservation,\ninterests in landscape
architecture, as\nMohsen so beautifully
put in his introduction.
So I've organized the\ntalk in two sections.
And the first I'll\nshare with you
a few issues that are\ncentral, in a sense,
to things that bother me.
They're by no means\nvery finely articulated.
Many other disciplines\narticulate these issues
in much more nuanced ways.
But their issues that one\ncarries around in one's
head when one designs.
And the second part will\nbe a series of projects--
I'll slip into\nthose quite easily--
where I'll share with\nyou their design logic,
materiality, et cetera.
And of course, the\nconnections between the two
I'll leave to you and\nthe explicit connections
I've represented\nmore accurately,
I think, more explicitly\nin the exhibition.
So I think the first issue that\nI think is really important
for us-- and this is\ntalking about India,
but I would say that we\nhave the same concerns here
in the United States--
which is equity\nand social justice.
And these are looming issues.
And I mean, what does this\nmean for us as designers?
And perhaps it's going to\nbe the most important issues
in the coming years, I believe.
Because besides the disruptions\nthat globalization has caused,
it is the drive of\ncapital that we all
know in its form has\nbeen detrimental,
I believe, to the\nvalues we've brought
to bear on our environments.
And now we are doing\nthe mop up, clean up
act, through many efforts\nthat we are making.
And I've spoken\nat length of what
I've called the architecture\nof impatient capital
and the inherent\nimpatience of capital
to drive us towards a\nvendor-driven, autonomous
object.
To my mind, it's clear that\nthis free running capitalism
will never help resolve\nthis inherent contradiction
about our aspirations to create\ngreen buildings, socially
inclined in human environments,\nwhile as architects
simultaneously pandering\nto capital and the forms
it demands.
And this is a disjuncture\nthat we all live with,
and I think it's been troubling.
And I by no means\nhave the answer.
But it's been\nsomething of concern.
Steven McCurry's wonderful\nimage from Mumbai
that captures the human\ncondition in some ways.
Or in the more recent\nbook by Wolfgang Streeck,
the book that's called\nHow Will Capitalism Fail,
he has said, to quote\nhim, "Capitalism
can no longer turn private\nvice into public benefits.
Its existence as a\nself-reproducing, sustainable,
predictable, and legitimate\nsocial order has ended.
Capitalism has become more\ncapitalist than good for it."
Or to just go back\nto the origins, which
is to quote Karl Marx,\nwho said of capitalism--
and to quote Karl Marx,\nhe said, "Capitalism
has conjured up\nsome gigantic means
of production and exchange.
That is like the sorcerer who\nis no longer able to control
the power of the\nnetherworld whom
he has called up by his spell."
And we are being as disrupted\nby the floods and all of this
that you see on this image--
I shall say no more--
in India.
And this is the new brand\nin Mumbai, that building,
which is gold gilded--\nit's actually gold plated--
is being built in the\ncontext of Mumbai.
And so you begin to start\nseeing this extreme.
Spatial iniquity is critical.
As Charles Correa\nsaid, to quote him,
"Today the amount of\nurban space one controls
is directly proportional\nto one's status or income
it has no connection\nto actual family size.
In fact, poorer people most\noften have larger families.
This space\ndifferential, therefore,
cannot be justified in human\nterms, but only economic ones."
In Australia, in\nurban areas, at least
in the 1980s,\nsomething I verified
a few months ago in\nSydney, every family
could have no more\nthan a quarter acre.
Australia was locked\ninto spatially equality,
and thus clearly a society, I\nbelieve, that detests elitism.
But equity is not a\nquantitative measure alone.
It has a subjective\ndimension of access,
sometimes perceived access or\nan illusion of equity perhaps.
Plot divisions in the very\nfabric of a city speak to this
and can be great contributors\nto this, and by extension
architecture.
And I think these are\nthe kinds of questions
that we may have to make\nthe connections when we are
defining urban form architecture\nand our own place in being
instrumental in the world.
This is an image from\na project we've done,
which I'll talk\nabout in a minute.
But to just evoke something\nMartha Chen teaches the Kennedy
School, and is someone who\nworks on informal economy,
she has really articulated\nthis beautifully.
And she's advocated that\nin the context of economy.
And to quote Martha, "What\nis needed most fundamentally
is a new economic paradigm,\na model of a hybrid economy
that embraces the\ntraditional and the modern,
the small scale and the\nbig scale, the informal
and the formal.
What is needed is\nan economic model
that allows the smallest units\nand the least powerful workers
to operate alongside the\nlargest units and the most
powerful economic players."
So these become\ninteresting inspirational
or nourishing and emblematic\nof what we could set up
as these sort of questions.
Because I think\nthe reason I bring
this up is because\nthis extends then
to the debates\nabout sustainability
as we carry them out.
Because what sustainability\nhas come down to-- and maybe
I'm simplifying this--\nis it's become a chemical
and mechanical fix for any\nproblem perpetuated and driven
by a green industry.
And the crucial\nquestions that are absent
have to do with\nspatial arrangements.
You don't see that being\ndiscussed adequately.
How do you make space\na social condenser,
an armature to foster and\nfacilitate social connection,
not hard thresholds\nthat separate?
But here, the human\ndimension becomes,
I think, important, at\nleast in my observation.
This has been a lot\nmissing and absent
from the debates\nabout sustainability.
And I believe that\nis frightening.
Pluralism and coexistence also\nbecomes an interesting issue
that we have to grapple with.
Its coexistence\nof different forms
is inevitable in a democracy,\nlike the one in India,
but around the world.
And the collisions\nbetween differing forms
of urbanism in close\nadjacency is a reality.
Thus dissipating\nthese polarities
and softening thresholds\nbetween these disparate forms
of urbanism are an\nessential design challenge.
Facilitating the connections and\nnetworks between diverse forms
is one way to promote the\nsynergistic dependency.
The questions that come to\nmind, for example, again,
in trying to make\nthis bridge for us
to articulate these problems in\nways that we as designers can
respond is can borders be\ndeconstructed and softened?
Can boundaries be\ndissipated spatially?
Could this become the basis\nfor a rational discussion
about coexistence, or is\nthe resulting urbanism
inherently paradoxical?
Is the coexistence of\nthese differing forms
and their respective states of\nphysical utopia and dystopia
inevitable?
Can the spatial configuration\nor how this simultaneity occurs
be formally imagined?
Or is it again\ninevitable that cities
will be molded in a singular\nimage, where architecture
is the remarkable but singular\nspectacle of the city?
So I think some of the\nresearch that Mohsen
was referring to on ephemeral\nurbanism, et cetera,
is concerned with\nthese questions.
So what I've so far\ndescribed to you
is the spheres of our concern.
So how do we make a\nproductive overlap
between the spheres of our\nconcern and the spheres,
or our direct or\nindirect influence?
And I think this becomes a\nvery critical question for us
as designers.
Otherwise, we live\nin two worlds.
We cannot synthesize this.
Because as architects, we\nare aware and concerned
about many issues, like\nthe ones I describe,
from the societal to\nthe planetary scales,
and ranging from poverty\nand public health
to urban violence\nand climate change.
More often than not,\nour sphere of influence
doesn't empower\nus to address any
of these issues in\na tangible manner.
Across the design\nprofessions, a frustration,
I believe, to our attempts to\nengage with these problems is
palpable.
Entire disciplinary\npractices are
in dangers of being dissipated\nbecause they can't move
beyond expressing\nand articulating
or representing these concerns.
And you know, this is an\nover-quoted statement here
by our own Professor\nKayden, who famously
says, "To design is human,\nand to implement divine."
And by extension,\nfor me, it would
be, to be concerned is human and\nto be able to influence divine.
But most importantly,\nthese narratives really
illuminate the\nnarrow circumspection
of the architect's\nterritory of operation
in the business-as-usual\nmodels of practice.
It also sheds light on ways\nto better understand the site,
as mediated through and\nembedded within a larger
scale of economic, social,\nand political process.
And I think it's through\nthis broader scope designers
can potentially have a more\nfar-reaching, progressive
social impact beyond the\nimagined sites of our projects.
And so, for us, using the city\nas a generator of the practice,
understanding the\nmeta-narratives that
are critical for situating\nthe object or the building
in this broader landscape,\nis somewhat aspirational.
And so, in order\nto do that, I think
a fundamental\nquestion is, we talk
about the practice\nof architecture,
but what is the\narchitecture of practice,
the models of engagement?
And I think these need to vary.
So in the way Mohsen\ndescribed the varying kinds
of engagements which have\na consistency, maybe,
in the values of the\naspirational dimension
might not necessarily\nbe cohesive
as we see it in a narrow\nway of an aesthetic.
And I think that comes\nfrom different ways,
because you then engage\nwith different protocols,
depending on the different\nmodels that you're
sort of being part of.
And so, you know, we look at--
this is what we engage\nwith, and this is important.
We do that.
I'm going to show\nyou some projects.
We also, at the other\nend of the spectrum,
begin to look at advocacy\npractices, self-initiated work
with NGOs, alternate practices.
But really, I think\nthe most effective
would be bringing it together.
And the mainstream as we see\nit is institutions, corporates,
developers, government in\nIndia, faith-based sort
of large campuses, et cetera.
But this synthesis\nis something that--
otherwise we tend to live\nin one or the other worlds.
And architects then\ntake a position.
And once you create\nthat binary in your mind
and you are wedded or committed\nto a singular mode of practice,
it becomes hard to navigate\nacross the spectrum
of potential constituencies\nthat you would engage with,
because the protocols and\npractices are different.
So we often talk about clients\nin many of our discussions.
And I think in our\npractice, one of the things
we have consciously done is for\nevery project unpacked this.
Because we feel every\nproject actually has patrons,
it has clients,\nand it has users.
Sometimes these collapse into\none, but sometimes they get
differentiated.
And the projects I'm\ngoing to show you,
I'll kind of highlight this.
Because recognizing this,\nI think, helps us then
not only engage with\nand define in our minds
a constituent group that we\nwant to be responding to,
but gives us a better\npulse for the condition.
But it also informs us about the\nvery protocols and processes,
and therefore the kinds\nof models of practice
that we might want\nto engage with.
And for me, the books is very\nmuch a part of the practice.
All of these are not scholarly,\nas you can see in the exhibit.
Sometimes they are catalogs.
Sometimes it's legislation.
But it is a response,\nthen, to identifying
the different constituent groups\nthat one has to engage with,
because one has broken what\nis otherwise the singular
definition of a client into\npatrons, users, and clients.
And these become a way\nof creating partnerships,
collaborations,\nfriendships which
serve to keep the\nconversation on issues
and engagement with work\nalive, because sometimes,
as you will see in\nsome of the projects,
these go over a decade.
And then the publications\nhave their own life,
because they go out in the world\nand influence other people,
perhaps, and expand that\nsphere of influence.
Because finally, I think,\nit really, in my mind--
and this is the last\nissue I'll touch upon--
which is that if we\ndon't find agency,
or we don't find\nways of collapsing
the spheres of our concern and\nthe sphere of our influence
and agency disappears,\nwe basically
break down as a profession.
And I think that is\nthe looming crisis.
I may be exaggerating it, but I\nthink it's worth flagging out.
And so in different\nconditions, this
plays itself out differently.
So for homes, single\nfamily homes or weekend
homes, which is what practices\nstart out with, this is one.
This collapses.
And that's where they become\nfrictionless projects,
because the patron, the\nclient, and the user
usually is a couple at most.
So, the issues are different.
You might argue about how many\ndrawers you have in a kitchen
or if the door should\nopen left or right.
But the basic moves\nare frictionless,
because it's collapsed\ninto one entity.
And so we have done\na number of houses
which are done in Mumbai in\nthe larger metropolitan area.
People build weekend homes.
And so we got engaged\nin many of these.
These are drawings\nby someone called
Sunand Prasad who used\nto be the president
of the RIBA in London.
He did these as a student.
But it's a very\ninteresting drawing,
because this is a villa with\na veranda, the colonial villa,
which is what people replicate.
And this is the\ncomparison where the villa
is a free-standing\nobject, whereas
in a traditional Indian\nhouse, the center,
the courtyard becomes where\nit's an inside-out Palladian
villa, because the symmetry\nand the image of the object
comes from within,\nrather than from out.
And this is the\nkind of thing that
gets built on the\noutskirts of Mumbai.
And I always tell this joke.
You know, this was for a\nvery well-known pop star.
I happened to meet\nthe contractor going
in the boat across the bay.
And he said he was designing\nthis house for this pop star.
And I said, who\nis the architect?
He said, I'm the architect.
So I said, are you\ngoing to design this?
He said, no.
She gave me an image of the\nWhite House in Washington.
I'm just copying it.
So this was the result.
And so, when you have these\nkinds of intervention that
create another kind of polarity\nand you have "beware of dog"
signs, you have lights\nand barbed wire,
this is urban people,\naffluent urban people,
creating a polarization\nusing architecture then.
So these are hard\nthresholds, because it
doesn't allow for any porosity.
It is contained in itself.
So in our projects we've\ntried to address this.
This is an early house we\ndid for a young filmmaker
and his wife where the\nliving room of the house
is a big porch.
It is a gesture of offering\nto the village, which
means that it's open.
They closed the house.
They secured the bedrooms\nwhen they go away.
But this porch is open.
It has taps that are available.
The roof collects water,\nwhich is fed to the taps.
So the villagers,\nthe caretaker, they
actually can use\nit as their space.
So there's a kind of pulse that\nyou dissolve the threshold that
otherwise would exist\nby defining the house
in the paradigm of the villa.
And so that sense of porosity.
But also, then, the\nmaterial, the way it's
articulated, its sort\nof these courtyards
within, which\nbecome light boxes.
Being a filmmaker, you\nare sensitive to that
and wanted to be able to\nplay with light and aperture.
So light is something\nof concern to us.
And that's what the\nporch looks like.
Those are the taps that\npeople can drink out of, wash
their feet, if they want.
And the door is closed, this\nlight furniture is moved away,
and they take it over.
So the caretaker uses it in the\nevening to sit with his family,
because these people go there\na few times in the year.
And so it's therefore designed\nin this kind of light manner.
And of course, being a tropical\nclimate, the blinds that you
see in the exhibition,\nwe use that a lot
as a way of creating the\nflexibility for shade and also
the louvers, because prediction\nfrom the rain and sun.
The entrance is very low key.
You just slip between this\nwall and that stair, which
takes you up to the terrace,\nand you come into the house.
And the materials are very,\nvery minimal and basic.
So the maintenance\nis low, but it's also
a refuge for people in\nthe city, the onslaught
of a city like Mumbai.
The visual onslaught\ncreates a different.
And then that's one\nof the light boxes
that they can modulate\nwith the shutters
to create different\nsort of light qualities.
And this was a house\nwe did in 2000, so it's
one of our older projects.
More recently, about\nthree years ago,
we did a house in\nthat same area,
where a doctor who sort of\ndiscovered drug-resistant TB
wanted to build a big\nvilla because now he
had become famous.
He was coming to Harvard\nto lecture, and he said,
I must have a villa so\nwhen people visit me,
I can take them there\nfor the weekend.
And his aspirations were\nexactly like the White House
aspiration.
And studying this, we\nrealized the village
is going to slowly\nencroach upon this land
because it's a longer road.
And so there were two or\nthree approaches we took.
One is, how do you\ndisaggregate it,
so that when the village\ndoes grow around it,
this merges with the\nlandscape in terms of scale,
rather than it being--
and the other was,\nwe said, let's use it
as an experiment ourselves\nto look at incrementalism
and affordability, which means\nif a middle class person had
to build a weekend home or a\nhome run in this territory,
they could build one unit\nand then they could add
these things as they went on.
So we got a house which was\nthree disparate parts, which
was owned by program.
And just to sort of\nquickly explain it to you.
So this is the living-dining.
And then this is a bar which\nhas a lap pool and the doctor's
study and a guest suite.
And then this is a bedroom\nzone which has three bedrooms.
So when the family\nis there together,
they can treat it\nas one big room.
And they have guests,\nthey put blinds down,
and it becomes three rooms.
And this is it.
The idea of the\npool being discreet
was very important, because\nthe villas I showed you,
people build pools in their\nrolling lawns with sprinklers.
And then you have\nthe poor workers
who are rural\ninhabitants of the area.
So again, just through the\nway space is articulated,
you actually highlight\nand exaggerate
these spatial iniquities.
And so, how can\none then use space
as a way to address\nsome of these questions?
And that's what we tried\nto sort of do here.
So the pool is very\ndiscreet, but yet it's
pleasurable visually.
And so you'll see\nit in the model,
the doctor's study and the\ncourtyard, the living suite.
And this is the bedroom suite.
And that's what it\nlooks like on approach.
The village will sort of\ncome up to this point,
and it'll dissolve.
And you can see it\nwith the rural area.
The scale is very low key.
It has a base in stone,\nwhich is a local stone,
and plaster surfaces\nand clay tile roof.
So it's very simple materials.
The windows are exaggerated.
Most of the ventilation\nis through the courtyard,
but the apertures that view\nout are these copper boxes.
So that was the only\nbigger kind of investment.
And as you go through the\nhouse, this is the living room.
So that's the dining,\nthat's the kitchen,
and this is the living space.
And one courtyard is\nconnected to the other
through a series of layers.
So not only does it allow for\na nice modulation of light,
but the air to go through it.
And so, the bar with the pool\nis what I'm showing you next.
So it's discreet.
That's the study.
It frames the\noutside, but it keeps
the privacy of the inside.
And it modulates the light,\nbecause in a harsh climate,
actually, this is a very\ncooling kind of scenario.
And it also tries to establish\nthrough its minimalism
a kind of peace and\ntranquility, which again,
coming from the\ncity, one pines for.
And then as you go through\nseparate courtyards,
this is the bedroom suite.
So here you have the\nblinds, which can all
come down to create privacy.
Or it can have a great\nsense of openness
when the kids are there and the\nfamily wants to deal with them.
This opens out to\nanother set of gardens.
And this collects the water.
So it's also designed to be\nenjoyed in the monsoon, which
is three or four months.
And so that's very\nexciting to deal
with climate in these ways.
In terms of details,\nthere's this thing
with just a flashing and\ncopper, which picks up the sun
and glistens.
And these are the copper walls.
And then these are\ndifferent colored windows,
which actually are the only\nthing that establish time.
There's no paintings\nin the house.
But through the day,\nas the sun moves,
the roof sort of is awash\nwith different colors.
And there's a palette of\noranges and reds and yellows.
And so each room in each\nspace is coded differently.
As we go to the next set,\nwhich is conservation--
actually, this becomes\ncritical conservation.
This becomes complex.
Because your patrons are\noften a chief minister
of the prime minister or\nan influential politician.
The clients are NGOs\nthat you're trying
to put together\nas a constituency,
and the users are\ncitizens there.
So this is where the books, the\ncatalogs, the other instruments
for modes of advocacy and\ncreating these conversations
become important.
And so, again, in the\nexhibition, this is elaborated.
But we've been involved\nin getting conservation
legislation through.
This was a document that\nled to the conservation.
And this was a whole\nstory in itself.
And these were our\nconcerns in a sense.
And of course, they also\nresulted in an influence,
because this was the\nfirst urban conservation
legislation in India.
But how do you make this\ninstrumental on the ground?
And so, some of this was\nalso self-initiated projects.
So we found in one\nof the districts
in this historic\narea the biggest
chunk was the Prince of Wales\nmuseum, which was a big player.
And we made a master\nplan for them,
conservation master\nplan, and then identified
small interventions\nthat could be
made that might\nchange and expand
the functionality, the presence,\net cetera, of that museum--
for the contemporary\ntime, but also given
the situation in the city.
And the first intervention\nwas, we found a warehouse which
was, there's no windows here\nexcept for that hoist-up
material.
And in this little\nkind of setback,
we created a\ncontemporary veranda,
which opened up circulation.
And you suddenly got 50,000\nsquare feet of gallery space.
So when they saw that happening,\njust because we had proposed
it, it opened up\na whole dimension
in terms of how they\ncould raise funds.
And we made models, and that\nled to it actually happening.
And so this is where you see it.
There was a shaft\nfor light, which
we converted into a\ncirculation system,
and added what you see in gray.
And we picked up on the\nvocabulary and rhythm,
because this is a\ngrade one building,
but treated it like a\ncontemporary intervention.
And this was a stone\nthat was excavated
from the openings that\nwere created to make
the connections as a memory.
But this was done as\na reversible gesture.
So the idea is this\nwhole thing can
be dismantled without\nmuch destruction
if another generation\nfelt this wasn't
the good attitude or the\nright attitude to approach it.
So, the temporal dimension here,\nthe sense of reversibility,
is what makes it a\ncritical intervention,
because this is a\nresponse to a moment which
might defer in terms\nof values society
has, down a generation or two.
And then we added-- they\nneeded a gateway because it
was a real mess here.
So a museum shop, a little\nauditorium, security, tickets,
all of that.
So we sort of made an\nentrance to the museum,
which sort of becomes a\ngateway to the museum.
And now we are doing a little\nchildren's pavilion here,
which is under construction.
So this became the gateway.
It was in stainless steel\nin a grade one building.
Again, the\nreversibility dimension.
It's totally\nreversible, very easily.
And it becomes a\ngateway to the museum,
which is where you pick\nup your bags on your way
out, so it's very discreet.
And it's a contemporary\nkind of intervention there.
And this third example,\nwhich is the Chowmahalla
Palace in Hyderabad,\nwhich is a large palace--
the Charminar is\nthere, for those of you
who might know Hyderabad,\nand this is Nizam's family.
They were the richest people\nin the world until the 1920s.
And he was also\nsomeone who didn't
want his state of Hyderabad\nto go to the Indian Union.
And the army had to\ngo in to take it over
to make it part of India\nwhen we had a partition-- so
an interesting character.
And this had fallen\ninto disrepair
because he migrated\nto Australia.
And this was a large\nchunk of property there.
And what you see in red--\nso, that's the palace.
But the palace used to\nextend this whole chunk,
with the [non-english]\nthe big mosque there,
and they had direct\naccess to the mosque.
And everything in red\nwas encroached illegally,
but with concrete buildings.
So it wasn't like it was\nstuff that could be reversed.
And so the question here--
and it was a very\ncomplex project.
It involved lawyers, the Nizam's\nwife, his first wife, Princess
Ezra, who is Turkish,\nwanted to do something
to give back to the city.
And we got involved.
It was a 12-year project.
But basically to position\nit as a public space
for the density--
you can see the density here--
of Hyderabad.
And how to stabilize\nthis encroachment--
and so we focused on\nthis series of courtyards
where the definition was\nvery clear and restored it.
That's how we found it when\nwe started the project.
It was a process of\nmeasure drawings.
And there are about 200\nof these, some of which
are in the exhibition.
And an amazing experience,\nbecause we also
forget what measure drawings\nare and how you touch and feel
and realize the\nscale of a place.
It gives you an amazing pulse\non not only the material,
but then as you start mapping\nin a forensic way, the defects,
the problems, you\nbegin to open up
a world of materials,\nconstruction techniques,
and attitudes which otherwise,\nin our daily practice,
we forget.
And I think this\nis very important,
because I think here--
we use the word\ncritical conservation.
And I think it's this critical\ndialogue that is created
between the old and the new.
That's what is very important.
And you know, just building\nback things in line.
A column like that\ntakes three months.
It's essentially a post and\nbeam structure, which you see.
But everything that is decorated\nwas just made up in lime.
And each column\ntakes three months.
So how you sequence it-- it's\na whole different approach
to engaging.
The protocols are different.
The way you can read, the\ninstructions is different,
the camaraderie and\nthe relationship
you have to build with the\ncraftspeople is different.
And so it is a reality\ncheck, because it tells you
about other forms of\npractice, let's say.
And so that's some of\nthe restored areas.
And that's the\ncentral [inaudible],,
which was the durbar.
And you know, that entire\nceiling was remade.
I mean, it had\ncompletely collapsed.
We had samples.
We recast it from that.
And in India,\nthese crafts exist.
So that is a luxury.
And how you build those\nrelationships is the challenge.
And now it's a museum to\nthe legacy of the Nizam,
but very carefully done.
There's glass that separates\nthose antique saris
from the viewers.
But it's done in a way that\nit's barely noticeable.
The budgets were very\nlow, so it is a gallery.
It was very easily done.
There's no air conditioning.
But it's done for the\npublic to enjoy this campus
as a public space.
So in putting this\ntogether, I just
happened to come across this in\nThe New York Times on Sunday.
And I've been watching here\nat the GSD through the summer
the repair of Gund Hall.
And you know what Kevin\nCahill and his gang
have done is mind blowing.
They recast those concrete\npillars patiently.
But if you look at the\ncorner in the char house,
where the pillars meets\nthe wall of Stubbins,
the match is perfect.
It's 100%.
You can't even tell\nit was repaired.
It was painstaking.
It was three months.
It reminded me of the columns\nwe had to do in the Chowmahalla
Palace.
And the thing is that I\nthink we, as architects, are
interested in a kind of creative\nconservation, naturally.
I think all our projects is\nabout this critical dialogue
between the old and new.
And our interests,\nas you can see,
lies in the recycling\nof building spaces'
revitalization.
And as designers, I\nthink we're equipped
to see the\nopportunities that exist
in the reorganization\nof space, and therefore
the new potentials for\nhistoric buildings.
And as a practice, we've learned\na great deal about design
from conservation,\nwhich informs our work,
I think, tremendously\nabout weathering.
Mohsen has written\na whole book on it,
but weathering-- that\nintersection is just
mind blowing.
We believe that the design\nof a good modern building
and the conservation\nor historic building
are not different practices.
But I think within the\nframework of pedagogy,
what I saw happening\nat the GSD makes
me think that maintain-- this\nsays innovation is overrated.
We all live in that\nworld of innovation.
We get excited about\nthe word innovation.
But maintenance, restore,\nrepair, et cetera,
is as critical.
Because we are interested as\narchitects in the subjective,
which is the intangible.
But the hyper-tangible\nis as exciting.
And I think dealing with both\nthese ends of the spectrum,
of the hyper-tangible\nand the intangible,
is also the potential\nfor creating
an intersection\nbetween what we talk
about as risk and resilience\nand critical conservation.
Look at the amount of\nrebuilding that's going
to happen in Houston\nin the next few days
and many other parts\nof this country.
But around the world with\ndisplacement, refugees.
And so repair and\nrestoration and maintenance,
we have to also\nfind within pedagogy
and articulate a position,\nalbeit theoretical,
to take this more seriously\nand to create intersections
between risk and resilience\nand critical conservation.
So when I saw this on Sunday,\nsomething clicked in my head.
And I said, I must sort\nof put this up there.
We go to institutions, it\nbecomes really interesting.
Because here, the patron and\nclients sometimes collapse.
But the users are\noften differentiated.
And even the\npatrons and clients,
I would argue, whether\nit's here at Harvard,
you have committees\nof the president,
and then you have clients\nwho are maybe the faculty.
And then you have users\nwho are the students.
And so these, again, they\nare different strategies.
This was a very\nearly project we did
for the Tata Institute\nof Social Sciences
in Tuljapur, which is\na very remote campus.
It gets two inches of\nrain, so there's no water.
And so we designed this\nbuilding as a large ship.
This was the master plan.
And the building I showed\nyou was a part here.
Sorry, this one.
We only did some\nsamples, and then they
got other architects\nto build, which
was about collecting water.
And you can see a\nreally harsh landscape.
But it was also\nabout disaggregating
the water and passive cooling.
So we created these\ncooling towers
where water for each zone\nor for each dormitory
and their toilets\nwere stored locally.
So people would ration it.
So there would be a group of\n20 people responsible for how
the water was used.
And the water trickled on a wet\nmat here, and the air came in.
So you could actually\ncool the rooms.
So it was that wind\nscoop principle
from [inaudible] and\nmany other places.
And we also tried to take what\nwas in this very poor area--
there are just\ncourtyard houses--
and the little decoration\nand a door which is painted
is all they can afford.
So there's a kind of\nfrugal aesthetic there.
So that became the kind of\nbenchmark for our inspiration.
And this is now talking\nabout 22 years ago.
So one has, of course, changed.
And then we experimented\nwith material,
because it had to be local.
It was about training people\nlocally, so it was ferrocement.
We actually set up machines\non recycled cycle tired.
And this is the ferrocement.
So it's a very minimal amount\nof cement, local stone.
But then it brings a\ncertain discipline and rigor
to the kind of buildings\nthat are produced from it.
And so this was the\nonly way to build
in a remote location like this.
And some of the housing, where\nthe terrace was a pavilion,
because that was the best place\nto sleep in the afternoon.
So it was like this sort\nof ship in the desert.
But I sort of learned from\nit, because in some ways,
what I call the dimension\nof passive cooling
failed completely.
And one realized that\nsustainability is really
linked to lifestyle.
We talk about that, and you\nknow, to make this work,
it means the 20 students have\nto all go into their beds
at 10 o'clock and stay still\nso the air is not disturbed.
And then it would work.
But if they're hanging around,\ndrinking, smoking, partying,
this is never going to work.
Then you have to put in the\nmechanical fixes of fans
and all of that.
And so that link between\nlifestyle was very revealing.
Our most recent project,\nwhich is not yet finished--
I was talking to Mohsen just\nbefore the lecture about it--
is a building in this, I would\nthink, historic modern campus
of CEPT University.
It was designed by\nDoshi starting in '65.
I studied here.
It's an absolutely amazing\npiece of modern architecture.
And over the years, the\nschool has grown tremendously.
And you had a campus that\nhad become very messy,
with all sorts of\nbuildings and no coherence.
And so we were given a site.
Christopher Benninger,\nalso an alum of the GSD,
American architect who lives\nin India, made the master plan.
And he put this as the\nsite of the library,
really, to be on axis\nwith Doshi's buildings,
because that's\nthe main entrance.
But also in a way to\nengage different parts
of the campus, which\nhad otherwise got
disaggregated in some way.
So what we did was--
what we've done\nis this building.
We are now doing the cafeteria.
We added a little\npavilion here--
different things\nto bring coherence
to this sort of central hub to\nregain this sort of identity.
But a very difficult project,\nbecause here my patrons--
actually, my clients and\nmy users were architects.
And so that was-- and\nmost of the clients
were architects who were\nfive, 10 years senior to me
in the School of Architecture,\npeople you almost called "sir."
So it was very hard to\nnegotiate with this.
And it also meant many,\nmany presentations
put up on YouTube.
You had alum calling\nfrom Toronto telling you
what you should be doing.
So it was a very, very\ncomplicated thing.
But the most complicated aspect\nwas Christopher Benninger,
the program that he\nput here, would require
a six-story building,\nwhich was very complicated,
especially in this campus.
And so we decided this\nwas an intervention
in a contemporary\npiece of heritage site
or historic kind of thing.
So we basically\nestablished that we
were going to pick up on\nall Doshi's buildings,
not go a centimeter higher.
And so essentially, we had no\nchoice but to go underground.
And this was my\nfirst presentation,
when I surprised them.
I had the model closed.
And they saw a\ntwo-story building
or a three-story building.
And they said, you\nhaven't read the brief.
This is impossible.
You can't do it.
It has to be six stories.
And then I pulled\nthe model aside.
And this was the\nmoment where there was
silence for about half an hour.
They were looking at each other,\nnot knowing quite what to do.
But we basically\nproposed a building
to respect Doshi's buildings\nthat would go subterranean.
But also, it made sense from\na geothermal perspective
and the temperatures go up\nto 50 degrees centigrade.
It's a very hot dry.
The CEPT's stepped wells,\nsome of you might know,
have this precedence of\nhow you can use this depth.
So we go down actually\n12 meters into the ground
in the library,\nwhich is quite a lot.
And so basically what is below\nground is all in concrete.
It's heavy.
It's three buildings\nwithin buildings,
which is, you have a\ncentral core, which
goes down four floors.
It's a library stack.
It's like a big walk-in\ncloset for books.
And the logic of that\nis completely different.
It's 8 feet heights, because\nyou don't need more than that.
And there are 25 rooms\nthat you can sit in.
And then you have\nanother skin, which
is the spaces that\nsort of surround it.
And then you have a kind of skin\nthat covers that, encloses it.
And then you have\nan outer skin, which
is the facade above ground.
So it's a three-layered\nbuilding, which then also
is a response to the climate.
Because in the tropics,\nbuildings are traditionally
heterogeneous in\ntheir composition,
consisting of many\nparts, responding
to different aspects\nof the climate,
keeping rain out, modulating\nthe sun, et cetera.
And so I think the modernists\nsimplified this into,
or believed that large\nareas of a single material
tend to prolong the\nlife of buildings.
So besides changing the form\nand structure of architecture,
in a sense, so here we tried to\nreclaim that, at least address
that, and especially in\na school of architecture,
where we felt students\ncould maybe learn from that.
And so this is the\nmodel that's here
in the exhibition\nwith the upper facade.
This is a concrete base.
And these are courtyards, so\nyou actually get natural light
all the way down there.
And then these are\nthe stacks, which
are just for more dead storage.
And so in another angle, you\nhave carrels that sort of--
these are courtyards.
They get very nice light.
And these are carrels that\nsurround the courtyard,
so it becomes a layer.
And then these become\nlarge spaces for reading.
And this is the book stack\nthat goes all the way down.
It's just been occupied\nbut not finished.
It will finish in two months.
So my images are limited,\nbut I'll show you some.
So this just shows you\nthe different sections
and the skin, which is\nin gypsum board, that
sort of creates a surface above\nground for that sort of area.
And so that's what the\nfinished product looks like.
These are the louvers,\nwhich are operate-able.
And these are thick\nwalls that are splayed,
where students can sit.
They sit and read\nhere, but you also
enter the building through\nthese different bridges.
This is when the\nlouvers are opened.
It gets completely transparent,\nand you can set it as you want.
And they're going\nto actually use
a class-- one semester is going\nto be a required class where
students are going to use\nthe building to map climate
and to understand its\nfunctioning, light, temperature
measurements, et cetera.
And so scale, as I said, was the\nmost important sort of aspect.
And so we took these datums\nand really worked with them
very carefully.
And you create a kind of\nsolid base which, I mean,
we didn't want to just allude\nto this directly by using brick.
So we kind of reinterpreted it.
Now this also becomes--
the pattern here is meant\nfor the convocation.
So this becomes the backdrop\nnow for convocation.
And they set the louvers\ndepending on the effect,
and they'll soon start putting\nthe year of the students
that graduate, I\nsuppose, on there.
And then when you\nlook through it,
this is the courtyard,\nthe first courtyard.
Those are the carrels.
This is the bridge\nthat connects you.
So this is really\noutside, in a sense.
And then you enter the\nbuilding at that point.
And the ground floor is\njust an ambiguous space,
meant for juries\nand exhibitions,
so it draws people in.
The reading rooms are above.
And the more quiet areas\nand the books are below.
So it's air\nconditioned upstairs.
And it has carpet.
It has a very quiet environment,\na lot of connectivity.
So students can work there.
It will be open 24/7 as a hub.
And so these louvers are very\neasy to maintain and to move.
There's a catwalk\non the outside here.
And one handle allows you\nto operate the whole thing.
So anyone can sort of really\nwalk, then you lock it in.
It's a very smooth, a very well\ndesigned or fabricated thing.
And so basically,\nyou have a catwalk
outside here, which also\nacts as a rain gutter.
And on the inside,\nyou see this brow,
which is a catwalk to\noperate the louvers that
are on the upper level.
And then as you go down,\nit's all in concrete.
It's all molded concrete.
The structure is very invisible.
There is a series\nof portals so you
don't see beams and columns.
And all the services are\nstacked in the books, the air
conditioning, the\nelectrical, the Wi-Fi.
So you don't see services\nat all on the wall.
So it's very sort of\nabstract and simple,
which is the areas that\nyou go down here and step.
So the light comes down\nthrough those skylights,
depending on how these\nlouvers are modulated.
So this is the\nfirst level there.
These are the carrels\nyet under construction.
And then you enter the\nbook stacks, because they
have their own logic.
So you go down half\na floor, up a floor,
and there is a\nseries of mezzanines.
And sectionally, you\nalways look at two levels.
So this is the courtyard,\nthese are the carrels,
you're looking at it\nfrom a book stack.
And here you go up these--\nand you can go down.
And the rooms are down\nthere, and then there's
another level that's lower.
And then you always\nlook at-- this
is minus 4 meters,\nthat's minus 8 meters.
You're always connected\nvisually, sectionally,
to at least two levels.
And here, the\ntables are going in.
The lights are built\ninto the tables.
But that's natural light\ndown at eight meters
within the building.
And so this is\nthat lowest level.
These portals define\nthe structure.
And this is where the\nbig tables have come now.
And so it's very minimal.
It's very quiet.
We were very interested\nin the idea of silence
and letting people\nimagine things here,
so the detail is completely\nstripped, to create as much
of a silent space as possible.
And in contrast, the\nlogic of the book core
creates an intimacy\nwith the books,
because it's only\neight feet, there
are smaller rooms\nwithin the stack.
It's like a walk-in\nwardrobe of books.
And it has that\nkind of intimacy,
as you have with your\nwardrobes for clothes.
And the light, like I said--\nso here you can see we
are modulating the louvers.
This is on a time lapse.
The light can, depending\non how you modulate it,
you can actually just\nuse natural light
to pretty much, at least on\nthese tables, have enough light
that you can kind of read.
And then, of course,\nthere's going
to be artificial light\nhere too, because you'd
need that at some point.
And so this is the\nquietness of the space.
These are the portals\nthat define the structure.
In the corner, there are\nrooms with their own skylights
for quieter reading.
And the stacks are\nalways adjacent,
that you can move\nin through them.
And these are the tables that\nare going in, in that sort of--
And the upper area\nis much lighter.
There are terraces,\nthere are verandas,
there are outdoor spaces,\nindoor, semi-open--
so you have a whole range of\nplaces that you can sit in.
And you know, of course, the\nlight will get modulated.
They have to set up\na protocol for that.
We are helping them\ndevelop a manual in order
to actually do that.
So then we go to corporations,\nwhere it's like the houses.
While it's collapsed\ninto one entity,
often it is differentiated\nbecause the patrons are
sometimes the chairmen of the\ncorporation who has one dream,
and then the clients\nare the real users
who make the committees.
But it's less.
But again, unpacking it\nhelps a little bit here.
This is a very early project,\none of our first ones in 2003,
where India was just\nliberalizing its economy.
And so the idea was, they wanted\nto build a glass star, which is
the brief that we were given.
And of course, we\nconvinced them to do that.
So it was a long, big\nfootprint, with courtyards,
like apertures that\nmodulate light.
And we used very local\nmaterials of clay tiles.
The roof held it.
And there was a\nmodulation within it,
as you walk through these\ndifferent courtyards.
And from the street, it had\na less looming presence.
The courtyards were\nvery transparent.
This is the arrival.
And it's telescopic because the\ncourtyards visually stack up.
So it's also very cool.
This is in the rain shadow\narea, so it's in Coimbatore.
It's about a seven degree\ncentigrade difference
between the outside and\nthis, because the water
is used in this dry climate\nto actually cool the building.
And it's open, single-loaded\ncorner doors for circulation.
So actually, the\ncirculation system
becomes the social\nspace, where we
had artists do installations,\nwhere people could sit,
et cetera.
And as you go into the\nbuilding, it gets more intimate.
So where the owners sit, it's\nalmost the scale of a house.
And these are different artists.
Rajiv Sethi was our curator.
Manjit Bawa was a very\nwell-known artist,
translated his forms\ninto a whole narrative
through the building, for\nthe railings of the building,
for example.
And we were very much interested\nin recycling materials there.
So all the little\nedges from the granite
that got cut in\nshaping the granite
were used to construct\nthe waterfall.
And so we tried\nto-- we were very,
in this early stage\nof the practice.
But also, as a resistance to\nwhat was being asked in India,
then everyone\nwanted a glass box,
because we had\nliberalized economy
and you could import glass and\nalucobond and all of that--
so for us to do also\na moment of trying
to go the other direction.
And one of the most interesting\nthings with the artists
was, it's a machine\ntool company.
So we went into their\nfabrication yard.
It's a company called\nLakshmi Machine Works, LMW.
And we picked up all the\nscraps from the pressing
of the machine tool.
And then with Yogesh Rawal,\nwho is an artist in Mumbai,
we created these screens.
Because a building is\nventilated naturally,
because it's a series of\ncourtyards with water.
And so this is all\njust scrap metal.
So the people who work\nin the building, this
is what gives them the wealth,\nand they touch the material.
But it also creates\na form of decoration
and picks up on\nthe original jali.
And, I mean, I'm always\ncomplimented that, my god,
it's nice you are promoting\ntribal art in India.
And I say--
I don't have the heart\nto say it's scrap metal.
And so, looking at these\nsort of corporate buildings,
I think the challenge here is\nthat corporate buildings are
being linked to the curtain\nglass style of building,
with air conditioning becoming\na symbol of corporate power
and aspiration.
And so, I think,\nin these buildings,
what we've tried to do is\nsort of move away from that.
And this is a second building\nin Hyderabad, in Cberabad.
That's Mario Botta's building.
Many architects have built here.
That was our site.
It's a company called KMC.
They do high\ninfrastructure highways.
And they have a\ncontrol room like NASA,
where they monitor all\ntheir trucks and workers
and all of that.
And so their aspiration was\nto do one of these glass boxes
in a high-tech building.
And I began to look at\nthis, and this is Hyderabad.
They would have riots there\nvery often, because they
were trying to split the state.
And so this in Mercedes Benz.
This is their showroom.
And so, when curtain\nglassing vendors
sell you the curtain\nglass or alucobond,
they sell you\nfishing nets with it,
so that people can't\ndestroy your building.
And you get a choice of blue\nfishing nets and white fishing
nets.
So the image of\nthe corporate box
is so strong that people\ndo this kind of thing.
So this is crazy.
But it was inspirational\nin some way.
And this was really what\nfinally inspired us,
this little water\ncooler in Jaipur,
which we were\nmapping, because we
were doing another project\nwhich I'll show you.
That guy works for the Business\nAssociation and Government.
And when he puts his\nkettle out-- this
is summer, 50 degrees, he's\nready for business-- it's free.
People come, they put\ntheir hand out there,
there are no plastic cups, they\ntake the water, they drink it,
they make a gesture of\ngratitude, and they go away.
So it's totally sustainable.
It's a thatch hut with\na beautiful brass lota.
And once in a\nwhile, he comes in.
He keeps the hut damp, so that\nthrough evaporative cooling,
the temperature of the\nhut is bearable for him.
And the water within the\nhut is kept in earthen box.
And that also has a porosity.
So with the evaporative cooling,\nthe water really stays cool
in what we call [non-english].
And anybody from India\nwill know traditionally,
everyone drank water like that.
And it's a beautiful gesture.
And this is what's very\ninspirational for us.
And so we aspired, then, to\nsee how we could translate this
into a building and use\nthe principles in a sense,
in this case, of, again,\npassive cooling, using material
like this.
And the light is very beautiful\nin the way it filters through,
and all of that.
And so we came up with\na building for them,
which is a five-story garden.
But it's not a\nvertical garden where
you stick green on the wall.
But it's a performative screen\nthat has a misting system that
keeps the screen cool.
It allows the air to go\nthrough and humidify.
These windows are all openable.
We couldn't get our\nLEED certification,
because we weren't\nsealing these windows.
So this is when one\nbegan to be bothered
by this chemical, mechanical\nfix kind of approach to it.
Because now, of course, this\nhas been corrected for India
through another standard.
And these are hydroponic trays.
So the plants require\nvery little water,
because this is the\ndrip irrigation method
beat and things like that.
But the water is\njust used to cool
the building in a spray form.
And then every facade\ncan be different,
depending on the\ndirection it faces,
the species it can support.
And we, of course, tested all\nthis out and came up with this.
And, you know, also\nimpatient capital.
They wanted the building\nready in 14 months.
And they finally\nagreed they'd give us
two years to grow the facade.
So we literally built the\nfacade and handcrafted it
in a small shed, using one\nof our previous contractors.
They had the cows come in\nbefore the building was
done to make the building\nsacred and all of that,
while we were yet making the\nfacade, which got done later.
And here, I think, also, what\nis happening in many parts, when
you look at Africa,\nwe look at India,
we tend to fetishize traditional\ncraft, because that is obvious.
And I think that's important.
But I think it's also up\nto us how we extend this.
So these are recycled\nalloys of aluminum,
which we got very cheap,\nwhich were melted down.
This was a mold.
We could only afford one mold.
So a sprinkler system\nwas built into the mold.
And there are very\nsmall panels, which
were handcrafted\nwith a nice texture,
because it was impure alloys.
And that's where it\nwas being recycled.
But you got a lovely texture,\nwhich for us architecture
is very good.
It was a large anodizing tank.
And then they just, in their\nyard, they stored these panels.
And when enough panels\nwere ready to put
into a small little truck,\nwhich was economical,
they took it to site,\ntwo people assembled it,
and that's when the\nbuilding was finished.
You had the misting\nsystem in play.
And you can modulate\nthe amount of water,
depending on the\ntemperature, for atmosphere.
You can make it run.
You can simulate the monsoon.
But that's wasteful.
But this is really to cool.
to cool, so you can really\nget it down to mist.
It all depends on the nozzles\nand the sort of control.
And it also is interesting\nbecause the water
gets, of course, recycled\non this large podium, which
is a garden.
You have the flowers bloom.
But the presence of the\ngardeners is very interesting.
It's what Marty Chen said\nabout the less powerful
and the powerful coexisting.
And you can avoid the garden.
The facade and the\nidentity of the building
depends on the\ngardeners, and they're
the lowest paid in that\nsort of corporation.
And, of course, it is an\nornament that comes out
of the shadows, et cetera.
And the outside looks\nlike that, so it's also
nice to shield that way.
So it's basically-- and\nthat's when it was first down,
becomes a woolly monster.
You have to give it a\nhaircut once in a while.
It cuts back.
People pluck flowers.
So it's a very simple idea.
But sectionally too-- and it's\na podium with the parking below.
And that's what it\nsort of looks like.
But also sectionally, it\nhas a series of courtyards
that extract the hot air.
So it also has a\nspatial logic, which
is about circulation zoning\nof the different parts
of the company, but also\nthe climatic dimension.
And, of course, it becomes\na really performative
vertical garden, with\ndifferent departments
and different\nspatial experiences.
That building got\na LEED certificate.
That's across the road from us.
So it made me think of the\nwalkie-talkie in London.
And so the evaluation\nof the public dimension
and implication of\na building, again,
is not measured enough, which\nis probably as important.
And so we did this intuitively.
We didn't start\noff by saying, we
are doing a building\nfor sustainable design.
Now our friends have forced\nus to measure temperatures,
so we are creating a database\nto see what this actually means.
But that's what\nimages look like.
And this image I come back to.
I mean, this woman\nis wearing her sari.
This is an image that\nan intern from Panama
who was working with us\nwent to site and took,
so it's not even\na staged picture.
But the fact that she has access\nto any part of the building,
the identity of the\nbuilding depends on her,
this is an empowerment of\nprobably the lowest-paid people
in that corporation.
And the fact that she is in\nthe presence of her bosses,
that they can make eye contact,\ni think, creates and sets up,
makes it a social\ncondenser of another kind.
And so, there are blinds there\nthat this guy could decide
to put the blind\ndown, but no one
does that because there's an\nawkwardness that comes from it.
And this is a form\nof transgression
which you can do through\nspatial arrangements.
And so they are really the\nheroes of the building,
because these are green jobs.
And, you know, the building and\nthe identity of the building
depends on them, and\nthat's how it sits there.
So we took this principle,\nturned it inside
out a little bit, for a project,\nour first project in Europe
for the Novartis\ncampus in Basel.
That's the river Rhine.
And we were very\nlucky to be called
to design there, but also given\na site right on the river.
And this is a site plan\nby Vittorio Lampugnani,
a very, very formalist\nsort of site plan.
They gave us that site.
Some of these are done.
Some are not done.
And then they got left\nwith two triangles,
so they gave one to\nFrank Gehry and one
to [inaudible],, because they\nfelt those could deal with it.
And with everybody else,\nProfessor [inaudible]..
I think that's his building.
And so that's what\nthe campus looks like.
That's our building.
It's the first one\non the River Herzog,
and [inaudible] got\nbuilt simultaneously.
And now this has become\na very beautiful park.
This is a very old image.
And then these are\nsome of the buildings.
So, these will all come\ndown, and they'll all
become the same height.
And so this was the\nconceptual first model, where
we said, instead of making\na monolithic lab, how
do you slice this down into\ndifferent zones, a veranda,
a big lab, people\ncan contemplate,
courtyards, et cetera?
Now, these were two\nsmall moves we made.
And perhaps it comes\nfrom working in India
and working in Mumbai.
This is the footprint.
Every building has\nthe same footprint.
And this is the given--
you have two, large,\naggregated cores.
And everyone on that\ncampus has followed that.
And we found that\nreally not effective,
because it separates people,\nit separates the scientists
from the administrators,\nbut also it
creates consolidated\ncirculation, which
means the accident or accidental\nmeeting, like the wonderful,
you know, GDS circulation,\nthat you meet people,
you choose which path\nto take, didn't happen.
And we felt, if you had\nto make this building
a social condenser in\nthat way, the circulation
and how you fragmented\nit was critical.
And in Switzerland, with the\ncode, with 30 consultants,
just to get that shift, and\nus being the first outliers
from India who had\nnever built in Europe,
was a whole drama in itself.
And I can give you a\nlecture on that process.
And for me, the\nhighlight of it was
when I used to get really\nupset trying to convince them.
There was one of our German\nconsultants who looked at me.
He was an elderly man.
And he was very, very mature.
And he said to me, he said, Mr.\nMehrota, you get upset a lot.
You mustn't get upset.
You must understand.
In Switzerland, we make problems\nbecause we have no problems.
And so that was like a flash.
And you know, we got very\nenthusiastic about this.
But anyway, they agreed to\nthis disaggregation, which
is amazing because it allowed\nus not only a massive footprint,
which was uninterrupted,\nbut it also
allowed us various circulation\nmodes, and therefore giving
people alternative routes.
The second one, again,\ncomes from very much
a "working in Mumbai"\nkind of attitude,
was that they said,\nOK, it's 4.5 meters.
That's a floor height,\nand you have to do that.
And then we challenged that.
And we said, look for officers.
You don't need more\nthan eight feet,
so why are we doing 4.5 meters?
And I don't know.
for some reason, they\nagreed to that too.
That allowed us to stack many\nmore offices there and call out
a large courtyard in\nthe middle, because we
managed to fit the program.
So those two moves,\nwhich we were
scared to do because\nno one had done,
i think when you\ncome from a place
where you're\ncontinuously maneuvering
these kinds of bylaws\nto find solutions,
it becomes your first.
You get suspicious and you\nsay, this can't be right.
We've got to tweak it, you know?
So it becomes a natural impulse.
So we came up with\na section like that
which is an entrance\nwhich comes to a viewing
gallery, a courtyard.
But you see these heights\nare differentiated.
So the circulation wraps\naround this courtyard.
And you have many\nhalf flights, which
means people can\nvery easily climb,
but they have also become\nincredibly social spaces.
And Gunter Vogt\nfrom Zurich worked
with us, the\nlandscape architect,
to develop this\nsort of courtyard.
And a facade, which\nhas 28 species.
So it also maps the climate,\nbecause with subtle changes,
different things bloom.
So it was a very important\ncontribution that he made,
and [inaudible].
And the other side of the Rhine.
So on one side, you\nhave this green facade
where the scientists can\ncome out from their labs.
And they look at green\nbecause they have been
looking at periscopes all day--
or microscopes.
And here on the Rhine side,\nyou have these large verandas
where you view the river.
And these have blind's.
I'm sorry my image\ndoesn't show it.
But usually the facade\nis very dynamic,
because they are\nautomated blinds.
So they go up and down,\ndepending on the sun.
And we used concrete, which we\nmixed the [inaudible] stone,
which is a natural,\nvery beautiful
yellow stone into\nthe concrete, and got
kind of the color of\nexactly the [inaudible]
stone, which sort of matched it.
And as you go into the\nbuilding, through the stair,
the circulation\nwraps around this,
you come to terraces\nat different levels.
And the lab and\nthe offices always
blur, because it's\nvisually very easy.
But because the circulation is\npunctuated by meeting rooms,
you begin to meet people.
And you enter it,\nand these are labs,
and you get glimpses\nof the labs.
A lot of them are automated.
We've used just three materials,\na kind of black graphite,
a Stucco Lustro finish\non all the surfaces,
and a smoked eucalyptus\non the cores.
So the cores for circulation\nare defined by the eucalyptus,
which you see here again.
And these are\nglimpses of the thing.
And we worked with [inaudible],,\nwho is a Swiss artist.
And she's done a series of\nthese video installations, which
you walk through.
So you kind of-- her idea\nwas that you would be
bathed in warmth of the color.
But she took what\nthe scientists were
looking at through\ntheir microscopes
and actually abstracted that.
So there are kind of\nfamiliar patterns,
but they are artistic.
And you always walk through\nit, and you get these colors.
And you negotiate the\nartwork on the floor,
on the walls, as\nyou walk through.
And then you come up.
It's a very simple\nplan, but it gives you
a rich space, because\nthe offices completely
open out into the courtyard.
These are the meeting\ndecks at different levels.
And you see a little stair.
You go up half a level,\nyou come to another office,
another half level.
It's a meeting area which\nis adjacent to the lab.
So the scientists see the\nadministrators and vice versa.
These are the decks\nto look at the river.
These are the labs.
This is designed\nby Toshiko Mori.
She did the furniture\nfor Novartis Worldwide.
And we were, I think,\nthe first to use it.
So she probably\nevolved it after this.
But this was a prototype\nthat she sort of developed.
And so this is part\nof the circulation.
The elevators are behind you.
And the circulation cuts\nthrough the garden, the labs.
It's all very accessible.
And therefore there's\na level of porosity,
as you see in these\nsort of half stairs.
And you can hide\naway in the garden.
And now, of course,\nit's grown much more
than when we took these\nimages two years ago.
And people can just\nsort of disappear.
And it's quite thick.
And again, you see the\ndecks for meetings.
And here, you see\nthe Stucco Lustro,
but you actually circulate past\nthe offices up half levels.
You see the courtyard.
So that gave us the\npossibility to create this kind
of spatial experience.
I just come to this\nlast part, which
is the hardest, which is\nthe social projects, where
patron clients and users,\nprobably the only ones that
are accessible are the users.
And the users are\noften people you
can't get a pulse on because\nyou have no access to them.
So they are slum dwellers\nor the absolute poor.
The clients become NGOs and\nother mediating agencies
that you work with.
And the clients are\noften governments.
And so, here this\nbecomes a wicked problem.
And I was reading\nrecently a piece
by Pratap Bhanu Mehta, who is an\nIndian commentator, economist,
I think.
And just to quote\nfrom him, he said,
"In a society driven\nby deep inequality,
there's not even a minimal\nbasis for mutual concern.
Where social distance\nmakes human beings
almost a different species\nin each other's eyes,
why would you expect\nanything else?
Why would a contractor care if\none of his construction workers
used his hands\nrather than a brush
to apply a dangerous chemical?
The more inequality\nthere is, the harder
it is to imagine what it's like\nto be in someone else's shoes.
It is hard to be\nadmitted that even
the most well-meaning\nand sensitive
find it hard to imagine what\nthe suffocation, darkness,
and sheer physical\nsuffering of being
at the bottom of a social\nhierarchy might really be like.
The very thing you would\nexpect to instigate
questions of justice makes\nit hard to even raise them."
And so it really is a\nvery difficult problem
to be engaged with.
And I'm running\nout of time, so I'm
going to go through\nthese very quickly.
This is just a map that shows\ninequality below the poverty
line in India.
And you realize except for some\npockets in Kerala, up there,
it's, like, dismal.
And here, like I said, you\nhave to differentiate it.
It's a project we did\nfor Magic Bus, which
is an NGO that works\nwith slums, where
we use this experiment to\nactually build a campus just
using materials\nthat exist in slums
as a way of creating\na familiarity,
but also inspiring these kids\nwho would go to this campus
to maybe repair\ntheir own houses.
I'll just go through\nthis quickly.
Some of you might\nhave seen this.
But we kind of use the logic\nof slums, the same materials,
solid base, lighter structure\non top-- the same materials
but reconfigured differently.
Dining rooms.
And then imagining them as\nprototypes, which means that,
could this dormitory and toilet\nbecome a community center
in a slum with a public toilet?
And so we began to use it as\na research project to do that.
And at that time, we\nbegan to get interested
in this question of sanitation.
And again, this is an\nimage I always talk about
that I took by accident.
And when I went back and I\nwas downloading my images
and I saw this, I\nwas really moved.
What moved me was to think\nthat this kid was so intact--
white socks, shoes, smile on his\nface-- come out of that slum.
He's probably\ndefecated in the open.
He's not had access to a toilet.
And that makes you\neven-- that's why
I use that quotation,\n"Do you even
understand these problems?"
So I mean, what is the\nmoral value of acting?
But what is the moral value of\nnot acting in a case like this?
This becomes an amazing dilemma.
So this is an extreme\ncondition where
our concerns are\ntotally legitimate
but our influence\noften can become
very hard to kind of negotiate.
And so open defecation is a\nhuge, huge problem in India.
In fact, we started doing\nresearch with Spark for this.
And you realize that India has\nthe highest open defecation
in the world.
I mean, Africa,\nwhere you would think
because of poor infrastructure,\nis nowhere compared to India.
And also because\nof India's density.
Just Mumbai, it's one\ntoilet for 1,440 people.
Our aspiration is one\ntoilet for 50 people.
That's a Bombay\nMunicipal Corporation,
which means six families\nwill use one toilet, which
means you have a\nlottery, and you're
lucky if you can use a toilet\nevery six weeks or something.
Because it's impossible\nthat 50 people could use it
or whatever.
So it's completely ridiculous.
Our prime minister has an\namazing sort of aspiration.
He wants a toilet in\nevery household by 2019.
And, I mean, it's\namazing that he's even
taking on this challenge.
But you see the defecation.
I mean, that's the\nhighest defecation,
open defecation in the world.
The problem is that, can you get\na toilet in there for every one
by '20?
Impossible.
And the reason is that we are\nthinking in absolute terms.
And this is the way\none can actually
make it a design\nproblem, because we
are thinking of the absolute\nrather than the transitional.
What we should be\nthinking about is
how do we make the transition.
In the same way\nas India is trying
to make its transition to\nrenewables from fossil fuels
through nuclear--
now, whether that's\na good idea or not,
but it is a transition--\nyou imagine transfer.
The design of transitions\nbecomes important.
And so what the\ngovernment is doing
is building prefabricated\ntoilets in factories
and taking lorries and dumping\nthem outside people's homes.
And research has shown that\nactually these toilets are
being used to store\ngrain, jewelry,
because it's the\nmost solid structure
in the whole compound,\nbecause it's in concrete
and you can lock it.
So it's a complete reversal\nof what the aspiration is.
So, of course, to\nmake the transition
before the transformation, or\nto think in terms of transition
as designers rather\nthan in absolute terms,
which is often how we solve\nthese problems-- whether it's
going to be the\nresponses in Houston--
these are going to be\nall absolute solutions.
The transitional\nquestion is important.
And I think we don't have\nenough of a vocabulary for that.
So, of course, community toilets\nbecome the important thing.
And so we came up\nwith a prototype
where we put the men and the\nwomen above, with the children.
And we created a\ncommunity center.
We made the mistake of\nputting the caretaker there,
and we got solar panels\nand got it off the grid.
And why I say mistake, because\nthat was a political mistake.
And this is where the\ndistinct engagement
of the client-patron\nusers is important.
Because here, we were\nworking with a mediator,
which was the NGO.
We had no pulse of the user.
And politically, we didn't\nknow what would go wrong.
And here, this-- the caretaker\nis usually the lowest caste.
And this politically didn't\nwork within that slum community,
where we didn't\nhave a first hand.
We were thinking of\ndesigners detached from it.
And that's how one\nactually configures
the patron, the client, and sees\neach of those constituencies
respond is a real challenge.
And we tried building\nmany of them.
And the government stopped them.
People stopped them.
We built one in a\nremote location.
And it worked really well\nas a community center.
It lasted for about six months.
I went back.
That's public housing,\nwhich hasn't been occupied
for 20 years, which\nis more reason
why we should be building\ncommunity toilets.
Because no one is\ngoing to go in there.
And that's, of course,\na different discussion.
And when I went back six months\nlater, it was a disaster.
Because they had abandoned it.
The politicians had\nmade it into a club.
That's a television.
They watch cricket matches.
There are rum bottles there.
And of course, then\nBeckett comes to mind.
Ever tried, ever failed.
No matter.
Try, fail again.
Fail better.
And so failure, I\nthink, is also a subject
that we should be discussing.
We entered a competition.
We won the first prize--
Gates Foundation-- where\nwe made it even more
embedded in the community,\nwhere it actually dissolves,
more reversible in terms\nof the materials-- again,
designing for these transitions\nas community spaces, also
provocatively placed\nit across the temple.
And of course, this\nalso didn't get built.
It felt like we were\ntrampled by elephants.
And this is just\nthe last project.
And I'll finish in five minutes.
So this is, again, a\nsimilarly complicated project,
where this is our client--
the mahout.
They're all Muslim in a\nstate of Rajasthan, which
is very Hindu, right wing.
And they look after\nthese elephants.
They earn about 5,000 rupees\na month, which is $100.
They are the lowest sort of\npaid community in a sense.
And they have sort\nof-- elephants are--
that's a mistake elephants are\nthere, because this is a desert
climate of Rajasthan.
They are used by the maharajas\nfor ceremony and then tourism.
This is from the New York\nTimes Magazine from, I think,
the '50s or the '60s.
It became something\nthat the tourists use.
And they get painted, which\nis terrible for their skin
because it discolors their skin.
And this is how they\nwere living, in stables
with the mahouts living on top.
And that doesn't work.
Because the mahout\nand the elephant
have a very close relationship.
Because he is the only\none who can control them.
They have an emotional\nrelationship.
And so they started\nliving down there.
That's when the government\ndid a competition.
We won the first prize.
This was the site that was given\nto us, which had been quarried
by sand contractors.
So it was a really\nterrible site to build in.
And in research, we\nrealized that this
wasn't an architectural\nproblem, that unless we
solved the problem of\nwater, this project
wasn't worth even doing.
It was a landscape\nplanning project.
It wasn't an\narchitecture project.
Not that we didn't pay\nattention to architecture,
but it wasn't an\narchitecture project.
And so we treated it\nas a landscape project,
creating micro dams,\nusing the levels,
trying to plan to store\nwater, to make a kind of sense
of a moist environment\nwhere we could plant trees,
looking at local species.
That's the site as we got it.
And we notice from Google\nthe water drain channels,
which we used to our advantage.
And that was the master\nplan that was built.
And there's many components--\nthe housing in all the land
that's not used for\nwater, a little--
a school, where there were\nsome broken down buildings
which we repaired,\na visitor's center
which hasn't yet happened.
And this is 2007.
So in 2007, when\nwe got the site,
that's what it looked like.
In three years, that's\nwhat we transformed it to
by just creating the micro dams.
So the same hill is that.
And 2017, that hill\nis the same hill.
The whole environment is\ncompletely transformed.
And in these 11\nyears, the project
has stopped and started\nand stopped and started.
And I'll just tell you\nthat story has I end.
But of course, we\ndesigned the housing.
The row housing is what\nthe government specified.
We broke it into clusters.
So a 400 square foot house\nactually becomes much larger.
It doubles in size\njust because you
add a courtyard and\nthen a shared courtyard
and a pavilion on top.
So these are subversions\nthat you can do spatially.
If you take a brief\nfrom the government,
you will really just\nland up doing that.
So that becomes a way you can\nactually tweak it to expand it.
And then if these three\npeople get along well,
they actually are\nliving in a mansion.
So those are drawings.
We, of course, took the\narchitecture seriously.
This was used to store the food.
And that gave you insulation.
And they also come in small,\nmedium, large and extra large.
So we had to test\nthem for sizes.
Elephants can't\nsleep on flat ground.
They have to sleep on a berm.
Otherwise, they can't get up.
So we had to profile the land--
or the room-- for the size\nof the elephant, so to speak.
And that's what it\nsort of looked like.
That's where they walk to work.
And this is now, it's occupied.
But it's not been painted.
But this is how we\nsort of imagined it.
These are different--\ndifferent people
have done different things.
Some people have lawns\nbecause they have water.
Some people grow\nflowers to sell them
because they have more water.
This is a reversal\nof an inequity.
Because the rich and the\nmiddle class who live in
Jaipur have to get\ntankers of water.
Whereas here, the poorest\ncommunity have more water
than they, so to speak, need.
So it's a subtle correction.
Not that we started out by\nsaying we want to do that,
that's the end.
I mean, we started\nout by just saying,
let's make an armature in\nwhich life can flourish.
And architecture was\nin service of that.
And these are some towns that\nhaven't been occupied yet.
But you can see how\nthe trees have grown.
And now they will be\nallocated as the new.
And life corrodes housing.
And so people have occupied it.
Goats have arrived--\ntrees, dish antennas.
And now the new\nstage of the project
has started six months ago\nwith the new chief minister.
And now we're going to have\nartists actually paint this
and decorate it.
And there's going to be\na whole transformation.
And so we are now going back and\nlooking at the infrastructure
there to enhance the water.
This is what the elephants do.
They take tourists up the\nramparts of the [inaudible]..
They go rogue.
I mean, there have\nbeen tourists who
have been killed\nbecause these elephants,
because of the heat\nand the lack of water.
Their skin discolors, as\nyou saw in that image,
because they don't\nhave water to wash it.
They walk to work on\nthese hot tarmac roads.
And so the environment\nfor them was horrible.
But now they can have a\nsnack on their way to work.
They have all the water.
These are images from just\nwhen we had done this in 2008.
And now, of course, these\ntrees have all grown.
But the main--
I mean, here's an\nelephant coming home
after the day's work.
But the main thing is the water.
Because the water, besides\nthe health of the elephant,
is very critical to the\nbonding between the elephant
and the mahout.
Because the process of\nbathing the elephant
is when they are\nmost comfortable.
And they have great\ngratitude for that.
And the mahout controls\nthem by bathing them.
And they remember that.
And so this has changed that\nrelationship, which they never
had.
They had other ways\nof sort of working
with their own elephants.
And that's a salute.
And now, of course,\ntrees have grown.
It's transformed.
Some of the lowest\nparts of the site,
because of water accumulation,\nare like forests.
Elephants can't\nhang around alone.
They're very social.
So we had to build\nthese towns where
they, for a couple of\nhours in the day, they come
and chat with\nfriends and all that.
But as time went by,\nthe teenagers there
saw this as an opportunity.
And they started a company\ncalled Elefantastic.
And it's on TripAdvisor.
You can book a meeting\nwith the elephants.
You feed them.
You give them 100 rupees.
You want to have a bath with\nthem, you pay 500 rupees
and you can have a bath.
So there's a whole\neconomy that has
evolved by these young kids who\nare the sons of the mahouts.
And this is the story\nwhich, for the exhibition
I did 2007 to '17.
And you see the red\nshows our engagement.
We are fighting,\nwriting letters,
meeting government\nofficials, lobbying.
We seem to be the only\nones interested in it.
Then we sort of give up.
And then I write\nabout 10 letters
to the BJP government,\nwhich comes into power.
Because they're the\nones who started it.
This is the congress\nand their allies.
And I write many letters\nto the chief minister.
And then one day, I get\na phone call from her,
like a few months ago.
And she says, I have\nall your letters.
They're on her desk.
And the files are all there.
Come and see me tomorrow.
And then I go and meet her.
Vasundhara Raje is her name.
And I meet her in January.
And she says, the\ntiming was wrong.
I'm sorry that I\ndidn't respond to you.
But now we're ready to go.
And so as we speak, there\nare 100 workers on site,
finishing it.
The artists are\ngoing to come in.
They're building all\nthe infrastructure.
And I'm hoping by January,\nbefore the elections are
announced, she'll get it done.
And that's one reason\nshe wants to do it.
But what is interesting\nis also the agencies.
Everything changes\nin these years.
And the architect seems\nto be the only one who
is interested in the project.
And so now when you\ncome to this point,
we started with some\nsets of agencies.
Now the forest department,\nthe zoo authority,
we're dealing with\ncompletely different people.
And it's a very\ncomplicated project.
But I think in understanding--\nand we did this a lot,
articulating what are\nthese constituent groups?
Who are our clients here--
the PWD, the forest department.
Who's the patron?
Writing to the chief\nminister in a parallel way,
aligning these things,\nworking with the mahouts
for their requirements, is\nwhat carried the project
for the 11 years.
If we hadn't engaged with\nthose constituent groups,
I don't think we could\nhave managed to do it.
Because we always had the\nsupport of the mahouts
and things.
So it's an interesting story.
And I hope I can\ntell it one day.
We have now repaired\nsome broken houses.
There are kids there.
So an American NGO\nhas started a school.
And life goes on.
So I think for me, working--\njust to summarize--
is working in Mumbai,\nin India, is about
negotiating these global flows\nthat do not erase and remake
landscapes, but rather to occupy\nthese local fissures to create
fascinating hybrids\nthat I believe.
And I think softening\nthese thresholds
between constituent\ngroups and your approach
to the models of practice is,\nI think, an interesting way
to engage with this.
The question for architects\nand conservationists,
urban designers, landscape\narchitects, planners,
is can we design for\nthis space of blur?
Can we design with\na divided mind?
Can be, more\nimportantly, be inspired
by the design\nintelligence of this kind
of particular condition to act\nand intervene as designers,
activists in our own locality?
Can we design to construct\nsoft thresholds that
facilitate porosity\nsocially and spatially?
So our approach has, in this\ncontext of our democracy,
been to do just that.
I believe this is a\npractice of democracy.
And it doesn't give you\nnecessarily the most consistent
visual images, which I\nthink Mohsen picked up
on very insightfully.
But it allows you to engage in\nthese multiple kinds of ways.
Because a pluralistic\nsociety is one
that not only accepts\ndifferences but goes
beyond to understand\nand is influenced by it
in productive ways.
That is to see the simultaneous\nvalidity of difference.
Because once the\narchitect and planner sees
these various differences\nas being valid,
the challenge is how to go\nbeyond their polarized binaries
through the making\nof architecture,
soft thresholds, spaces that\nare visually, physically porous,
plural in spirit and\nexpression, and most important
and critically encompassing\nof the context.
This is truly, I think, the\naspiration of our practice.
We are aware that many of the\nconditions that I've described
are emblematic of the\nissues and the crises,
really, that we are facing in\nmany parts of the globe, crises
within the profession,\nbut also crises
in the contemporary world\nthat we collectively occupy.
And I think understanding\nthis crisis and the condition
of crisis and articulating it\nin terms that are useful for us
to designers is an absolute\ncrucial first step.
Because after all, as Paul\nRomer from the World Bank said,
he said, a crisis is a\nterrible thing to waste.
Thank you very much.
[applause]
So Rahul, as you can tell from\nthe response of the audience,
this was really wonderful.
It was great.
Rahul is probably\nthe only person,
or one of the very few\npeople that I know,
who can deliver two lectures\nwithin almost the space of one
lecture and get away with it.
He always says this\nafter my lectures.
No, that's not true-- the\nfirst time that I'm saying it.
But I feel that there is\na third part to this talk.
And I really, really\nhope that we'll
have the chance\nto talk together,
to talk with some of our\ncolleagues, about the--
I think the next phase.
One thing that I was\nremiss to mention
is that there is a\nreception after this.
So there is actually\nsome food and wine
waiting for all of you.
And I don't want to keep you.
So I would like to invite\nRahul to a conversation that
will really pick up on\nsome of the consequences
and implications.
And maybe there\ncould be one or two
questions from the audience.
One thing that I feel\nwould be wonderful,
if you can reflect on, it's\nthe issue of the soft threshold
that you touch on in the\nexhibition is very clear.
It's very clear in terms of\nthe continuity of the projects.
It's very clear\nin the exhibition
when you start from\nthe left to the right.
But you didn't, in\na way, do the talk
in a chronological fashion.
But there is, in a way, a\nkind of chronological history
to these projects.
So my question is really\nabout the juxtaposition
of the ideas now in relation\nto the chronological history
of the projects.
By that, I mean there are\ncertain things that you could
do five, six, seven years ago.
And my guess is that\nsome of those things
might be becoming harder\nfor you to do today,
simply because the scale of\noperations of your office
is changing.
So this question of\nthe soft threshold
relates to the\ncombination of desires
to certain kinds of expertise.
And so I'm wondering whether\nyou feel you've had to
or you will need to change the\norganization of your office
to stay, in some ways, true\nto sustaining this concept
of the soft threshold.
And I suppose the\nthing that we will
discuss at a later\npoint is like,
what are the consequences\nof this kind of practice
in a way for pedagogy, for\nwhat we do for the education?
And this is\nsomething that you've
been very concerned with.
I don't know if we'll\nhave time to answer this,
but I would like to get\nmaybe one or two questions.
And perhaps you could--
No, I think that's a good\nquestion in two parts
that I'll answer it.
One is one of the things we\nhave done quite consciously
in the practice, which we\ncontinue to even do today,
is have the same mix, which\nmeans that although we might
now be doing one or two\nother institutional projects,
but at any given time, we\nhave a couple of small houses.
We are doing some\nself-initiated projects.
We are always engaged with\na conservation project.
We make a conscious effort to\nkeep that basket of diversity
of the projects alive.
And there are moments for\na few years that you don't
get a conservation project.
But we are always open to that.
And I think our constituency\nor the kinds of clients
that one comes in contact with\nand also because of the books,
which is what I think\nthen becomes a way
that you connect to\nthe world, people
come to you for those things.
And that's, I think, part\nof the way the practice
is constructed.
And again, I see this so\nclearly in retrospect.
But over the years,\na lot of it has
been intuitive in trying\nto create this mix.
I think-- and one\nof the things I've
tried to do in the\nexhibition is show
the chronology of\nthe writing, but also
the images of the projects.
And again with retrospect, I\ncan say this more confidently
that the first 10\nyears of the practice,
we got that one office\nbuilding with the courtyards,
which was lucky.
That client made us\nwrite in the contract
they didn't want to publish it.
So we never got\nanother big project
because everyone\nthought we did houses.
But the first 10\nyears of my practice,
I was really making\noperational in Mumbai
what I was trying to\nconstruct as urban design.
Because that's what\nI had gone back
with equipped and\nmost excited about.
And as I said in my talk\nhere, I saw urban design
as an advocacy practice,\ncreating feedback loops,
with the site-specificity\nof architecture
and the abstraction of planning.
And 10 or 12 years, and that's\nwhere-- and you're right.
I mean, if I actually presented\nthis chronologically, that
becomes very evident because\nthe conservation legislation
we were doing, the\npost-industrial
landscapes we were\nlooking at, it
had a lot to do with\nmany complex issues which
didn't result in building.
But it resulted in us\nbeing able to construct
an imagination of what these\nconstituencies are, how do you
work with whom, and therefore\nbring a set of agendas, which
then created a feedback\nto our own work when we--
because we were trying to\nthen create a consistency.
So it's not\nconsistency necessarily
of architectural\nvocabulary, but it's
a consistency of the concerns\nof creating what I'm now
calling soft thresholds,\nor interconnectedness,
or blurring polarities and not\nconstructing binaries, which
were very evident in our public\nprojects, which were then
brought to our architecture.
So actually, this\nhas made me think--
I never thought\nof it like that--
is that if one really\nreframed this chronologically,
I could tell the story\nquite differently.
We'll follow up on this.
I'm very keen to see if\nthere's any students.
I can't actually-- it's quite\ndark, so I can't quite see you.
But do I see any hands?
Or are you still--
great.
Are you still inspired\nby all that-- yes, we
have we have someone\nwho was not a student.
But he's a student of--\nyes, Professor Peiser.
In your community toilet--
well, first, it's just\na brilliant, wonderful
presentation.
But in the community\ntoilets that you
said were such a\nfailure, and part of it
was who the caretaker was,\nif you were to do it again
differently, what would you do?
Which is what we tried to\ndo with the competition--
of course, the given would be to\nfind a way of actually engaging
more directly with the\ncommunity we were serving
and whatever that might involve.
I think that was a given.
That detachment when\nI realized that was--
we were impatient about\nbuilding a prototype.
And that, I think, did it under.
The other would be to\nmake it more reversible,
to really make an expression\nof what is a transitional move.
And I think that would\nallow for its intervention
and many other permutations\nto occur in terms of design.
And I think that really,\nfor me, would be the two
things that I would go back to.
But I think what I\nlearned from it--
and this is just given\nthe context of Mumbai.
In another context,\nit might be different.
So making explicit\nit's reversibility
so it's not an obtrusion for\nthe community but also making
links with the community.
And I think design can play--
to give expression to that can\nbe a very powerful instrument
in making it happen.
But what I learned from\nit is that really, I
would struggle with it.
I spent two years where I didn't\nknow how to deal with the fact
that it was a failure.
And often, I've shown it\nin architecture schools.
And I've provoked the\ndeans or the chairs or--
too, it would be interesting\nif we actually did
a conference, a one-day\nconference on failure,
and got all the big guys\nwho come here to present all
their glamorous work, which\nwe can't believe how they've
achieved those amazing\nimages of beautiful projects
to come and just present\na project that they think
completely failed and try\nto deconstruct that process.
It might be useful.
And I mean, what\nI'm trying to say
is we don't have a vocabulary\nto discuss failure.
And therefore, we don't\nlearn from it so easily,
except at an emotive level or\nin the level of some protocols
that we might follow.
But I think it has to\nbe a deeper learning.
Yes, back there.
Wait for the mic.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hi.
I was really interested\nin how you're
talking about bringing together\nthe powerful versus the most
powerful, like the gardeners\nwith the office workers.
And I guess I was\nwondering if you
think architects should bring--
let me see how to say this.
The gardeners are still\nbeing paid the lowest,
even though they're standing\nright next to the office
workers, right?
And I guess, is there a way\nfor architects to empower--
actually give more\npower to the gardeners
in terms of how they're\nliving and how much they're
getting paid?
And do you think architects\nshould be a part of that?
Like, should that be a part\nof the architect's sphere
of influence?
So the short answer\nis communism.
[laughter]
The longer answer would be--
I mean, I think it's a\npolitical question, no?
Then I think it's a matter of\nhow, as architects, you also
have a position politically.
So I think the point\nI'm making is yes, you
can become political,\nbecome a politician,
begin to engage with\nthose kinds of questions.
Or you can engage with trying\nto imagine spatial possibilities
that might allow that to happen\nor that might facilitate it.
So I would argue that the\ngardeners there, first of all,
they have-- there's a\nlot of empathy for them.
They have great dignity,\nwhich they want.
Usually in one of\nthose glass blocks,
you have a lawn outside.
Gardeners would be working,\nsitting on their haunches.
People would drive\nby in their cars.
There would be with\nno eye contact.
And you go to their website.
I mean, I don't know if this\nis when we did the building.
The relationships between some\nof the people working there
and the gardeners is amazing.
They would be selling them\nbouquets of flowers on the side
if they forgot something\nfor someone's anniversary.
They were catching butterflies\nfor their children's biology
classes.
There was already-- now,\nthat is a beginning.
Because through that\ncommunication and this dignity,
there is empowerment, because\nthere's communication.
So it's much more subtle.
Maybe it's intangible\nand subjective.
But I think space can\nplay a big role in that
if we identify and articulate\nthe problems in that way.
And then, of course, there\nare other extreme ways
of dealing with it,\nwhich are more political.
So I think your question\nis not dissimilar to what
I'm hoping we will be\nable to follow up on,
what I was trying to ask\nabout the role of practice.
Because one of the\nthings that you could say
is that in the context\nof a US practice,
you could show the\nsame photograph
with the architect\noutside and the lawyer
or whoever else, the\nbusinessman, inside.
And the architect would play\nthe role of the gardener.
So there are those societal\nhierarchies that are in place.
But also in the context of the\norganization of the office,
the people who actually\nwrite the reports
and do the conservation\nprojects sometimes
are slightly in a\ndifferent position
than the person who is in a\nhighly technical situation
and delivering very\nsophisticated buildings.
So there is an issue\nin terms of how
one is able to sustain\nthat kind of practice,
for example in the US or in\nEurope, which may be possible
now in India.
But it's actually a\nconundrum in terms
of the complexities of capital,\nthe organization, the salaries,
and all of these\nkinds of things.
So that, I think, would be a\ngood thing for us to maybe--
In fact, that's a\ngood-- you know,
our studio is about\n21 people now, 20, 21,
something like that.
It's about eight architects\nthat are qualified architects.
And the rest are a\nwhole array of people
who've worked their way up,\nfrom tea makers and career boys
to model makers to--
it actually gives us-- so when\nwe do these measured drawings,
for example, that\nI was showing you,
it's not all the slick\narchitects who all necessarily
go.
But it's a whole\ngroup of people which
give different access in\nterms of information gathering
and all of that.
So I think that's a whole\ndiscussion in itself.
Anyway Rahul, thank\nyou very, very
much for a wonderful lecture.
Please join us for\nthe reception outside.
