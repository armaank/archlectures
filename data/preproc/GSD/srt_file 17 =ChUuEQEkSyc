Welcome everyone.
Tonight we welcome to the\nGSD Sarah Oppenheimer,
a really remarkable\nartist whose projects
engage architecture and space.
Well, space, you could use\nthis word more abstractly,
more broadly.
Her work actually\neludes categories.
So when we use these words,\nthey mean many things
in different ways in her work.
Anyway, she is really someone\nwho has done so many projects
and has so many\nachievements and awards,
I don't want to tell\nyou the whole list
because it will take too long,\nbut I'm sure many of you know.
And I will just give\nyou a few highlights.
Just, I mean her work\nhas been practically
in all of the important museums.
You know of the Andy Warhol.
She's been in Art Basel,\nof course, in St. Louis.
And this remarkable piece, The\nMattress factory, many of you,
of course, know.
Projects more recent,\nreally a great piece
at the Wexner Center, Perez Art\nMuseum in Miami, Luxembourg.
You'll hear about them,\nI believe, I hope.
A very important embedded,\npermanent exhibition
at the Baltimore Museum of Art.
These among others and\nmany important awards
among them, the John Simon\nGuggenheim Memorial Foundation,
the Rome Prize, the Joan\nMitchell Foundation Painters
and Sculptors Grant.
Just I can't do all of them.
But she's someone so\ndeserving of this I
think because of what\nI mentioned already,
the particular way that her work\nintersects different domains.
It's somehow, as I said,\noperating within architecture
in a highly unusual way.
She uses, if I may\nsay, certain kinds
of forms to operate on\nbuildings to produce,
in particular in that project\nthat I mentioned at the factory
at the mattress factory,\nto produce remarkable voids
and introduces also\nlarge scale fragments,
I would say, of buildings.
This is how I see these things.
And working with materials\nin a very unusual way
against the opticality, in a\nway, of the materials, the way
they produce effects,\nand in doing that along
with the voiding\nand introduction
of these giant scale\ninterventions really
changes the space of\ngalleries and museums.
She is sometimes called someone\nthat makes installations.
But I don't think\nthese are installations
per se, if I may say so.
They're something\nlike instruments
with which to revise buildings,\nto reconfigure architectural
conventions, particularly\nthose conventions that
involve temporality and\nspatiality as we understand it.
She, in a way, is like\nmaking interpretive acts.
She's performing\ninterpretive acts
on buildings that physically\nand cognitively alter them
I don't want to say too\nmuch more about what
she does because another\npart of this, which
is so exciting for me,\nis that her work involves
an exceptional kind of\nway of working on problems
discursively.
I have not had so many\noccasions to introduce someone
who articulates in the way she\ndoes, a mode of thought, that's
so directly connected\nto what she is doing.
And so this is something\nso special to have someone
sometimes called a sculptor.
She doesn't think she's one.
She doesn't like to\ncall herself that.
She's sometimes called\nan installation artist.
But if I were to\ncall her something,
I would have to say-- and\nI hope she won't mind--
that she is one of the\nmost interesting architects
that I know working today, oddly\nenough, even though in talking
to her, she really has not\nbeen teaching or studying
in schools of architecture.
So anyway, with all of that,\nwe welcome into our world
this very unique figure.
I'm so delighted\nto have her tonight
to extend the discussion\nof her work further.
Welcome, Sarah.
[applause]
Hello.
This is an interesting\ncontraption.
So I will do my\nbest to adapt to it.
I want to say, first\nof all, thank you very,
very much for having\nme here tonight.
I have looked at this\ninstitution for many years
at a remove.
And it's really exciting\nto join you this evening
and talk a bit about what I do.
And I also want to say\nit's very nice, Scott,
to receive an\nintroduction from you,
because your text on\none piece in particular
about a hole in\nRome really changed
my reading of that entire city.
And I spent quite a\nbit of time following
your strands of thought.
And it was a really\nextraordinary investigation
that you prompted and\nshaped in my mind from afar.
So I am very, very\ngrateful for that.
Thank you.
So without further ado,\nI am going to dive in.
A building's material boundaries\ncreate an ever changing relay
of immaterial trajectories.
Windows reflect daylight.
Doorways mediate precession.
Vents direct air flow.
These forces modify the\nbuilt environment in turn.
Daylight penetrates\nmaterial surfaces,
expanding and contracting\nconstruction joinery.
Living bodies\ngenerate live loads
shifting structural slab and\nnonstructural partition walls.
Buildings are time based.
The temporal cycles of each\nbuilding vary in duration.
The sun moves across the sky.
People walk through a room.
A door swings open and closed.
These temporal cycles\nintersect and overlap
oscillating between phase offset\nand coordinated synchrony.
The pieces I will\nbe discussing today
entitled D-33, 33-D, S-281913,\nS-337473 and S-011110 change
over time.
Each injects their specific\ndurational periodicity
into the cyclical life\nof an inhabited building.
Boundaries create the\nillusion of stasis.
Walls, floors, ceilings\nappear fixed and unchanging.
Alterations to the boundary's\nthickness, materiality,
and infrastructure shift\nspatial relationships
between inhabitants,\noften imperceptibly
altering a space's contours.
D-33 created in 2012\nmodified the relationship
of the boundary plane to\nthis material infrastructure.
The exhibition space was\ndivided into six discrete rooms.
Structural columns,\nhere indicated
by hatched white lines, were\nlocated at the intersection
of existing boundaries.
By shifting the spatial\nrelationship between boundary
plane and structural\ngrid, intersections
between the six adjacent\nspaces could be removed.
Sightlines and passage\nbetween the six rooms
was rerouted\nthrough these voids.
Visitors entered the space\nfrom a central quadrant
and could travel through the\ncorners of the six zones.
The cross section of\nthe boundary plane
was clad in black aluminum.
This light absorbent\nsurface flattened
dimensional relationships\nbetween rooms
and camouflaged the thickness\nof the interior walls.
Each of the six\nrooms was illuminated
with fluorescent white light.
As the visitor crossed\neach threshold,
the eye compensated\ntowards color neutrality.
The perceived difference\nin light temperature
became a significant tool\nfor marking spatial change.
Digital models of\nlighting failed
to explore this process\nof optical accommodation
to the light environment.
The studio developed a\nlarge scale physical model
to study the adaptation\nof the light of the eye
to changes in light temperature.
In the physical model,\neach of the six rooms
was fitted with identical\nfluorescent bulbs.
Bulbs were kicked to the\nwarmer or cooler Kelvin values
using theatrical lighting gels.
Here we see a conversion\nchart describing
the chromatic shift\nbetween a light source,
the filter, and the\nresulting light.
And here's a little example of\nhow this chromatic shift would
work.
Let's say your initial bulbs\nstarts with the daylight Kelvin
value of something in\nthe range of 2,000--
I'm sorry 7,000 is what\nwe're looking at here.
If you attach lens 204,\nfilter 204 around that bulb,
you'll end up with a much warmer\nKelvin value as an output.
Notice here that then these\ngels were schematically
divided between the six\ndiscrete zones and color
coded in this drawing\nin warm or cool.
And then a series of\ndifferent iterations
were set up inside the studio\nwhere people would study,
walking around this\nmodel over and over,
the relationship of\nchanging these filters out
and observed which had the\ngreatest perceptual alteration
or shift from one\nzone to the next.
New fluorescent\nbulbs were installed
in existing light fixtures,\neach corresponding as closely as
possible to the prescribed\nKelvin value from the model.
Much like the human\neye, the camera
serves as its own\nframe of reference.
Color correcting for\nwhite neutrality areas
and adjacent zones appear\nextremely warm or cool.
33-D created at\nKunsthaus Baselland
was also developed for an\nexhibition space illuminated
by a fluorescent lighting grid.
Daylight saturated the\nelongated space shown here
entering through\na row of windows
flanking the eastern wall.
Our light studies indicated\nthat the imbalance
in luminous intensity\nbetween daylight
and the gallery's fluorescent\nlights was extreme.
It rendered all\nmodification to the existing
artificial lighting\nimperceptible
during daylight hours.
Our light studies changed.
Our first explorations\ninvolved the division
of the exhibition space into\nlighter and darker zones.
We anticipated radical\nchanges in relative luminosity
throughout the day.
The directionality of\ndaylight created differences
in the boundary's\nsurface illumination.
One side of the\nboundary was bright.
One side of the\nboundary was in shadow.
Here, illuminated\nsurfaces are indicated
with a thicker white line.
Two segments of the boundary\nplanes, indicated in bold,
were comprised of glass.
The materiality of these\nplanes impacted the occupant's
perceptual field.
The glass appears reflective\nfrom the brighter side
and transparent from\nthe dimmer side.
Changes in relative\nluminosity shifted
the volume of visible space.
What is reflective during the\nday is transparent at night.
The perception of spatial\nadjacency changes over time.
Sightlines can be\ndiagrammatically reduced,
highlighting critical\nrelationships between viewer
and boundary.
In 33-D one such\ncritical relationship
is between the\naxis of precession
and the view to the exterior.
As the inhabitant enters, they\nencounter a transparent glass
surface.
Looking through the\ntransparent surface,
they can view the reflective\nsurface beyond, oriented
at 45 degrees both to\ntheir axis of perception
and to the light source.
Once the viewer\ncrosses this threshold,
the glass on either\nside appears reflective.
The illuminated glass\nsurface reflects
the view of the exterior.
From the far end of the\ngallery looking back
towards the entrance, what\nwas initially transparent
is now a reflective surface.
And what was initially\nreflective in prior slides
is now transparent.
The glass is\nstructurally supported
by the thickness, or\nwithin the thickness,
of the boundary plane\nboth from the upper detail
and again in the lower detail.
It allows the glass\nto hover off the floor
by approximately 1 centimeter.
S-281913 was located at the\nPerez Art Museum in Miami.
The plan of the\nmuseum's second floor
suggests a range\nof possible paths
through the building envelope.
Notice.
The undivided\nprocessional space weaves
between discrete boundaries.
This processional\nspace is flanked
by four enclosed rooms--
here, here, here, and here.
And these three rooms\nall have a similar rhythm
between the doorway entrance\nspace and a single window
to the exterior with a\nchange in orientation.
However, the dimensions\nof these windows
and the dimensions\nof these thresholds
are identical actually for\nall of these three zones.
Programmed as focused galleries,\neach of these discrete rooms
are defined by a threshold,\npoured concrete walls,
and the presence\nof a single window.
This cell-like arrangement\nheightens the visual relay
between threshold and window.
This cell-like arrangement\nheightens the visual relay
between threshold and window.
Neither columns nor contours\ninterrupt the visitor's line
of sight within the\nbounded gallery space.
The spatial uniformity\nof the gallery
appears to make the study\nof a viewer's sightlines
unnecessary.
As we have seen, however, a\nviewer's frame of reference
develops relationally.
A number of tools have evolved\nto study the reference frame
of the perambulating viewer.
From early applications\nof cognitive mapping
to JJ Gibson's\nanalysis of optic flow,
perception has been conceived\nas an ever changing relay
between environmental\nstimuli and human cognition.
The isovist is one\nsuch mapping tool.
This tool is central to\nthe studio's exploration
of the reference frame of the\nmoving stereoscopic agent.
Developed by urban\nplanners in the 1960s,
the isovist represents\nthe volume of space
from a single point\nat 360 degrees.
Working in collaboration\nwith programmer Andrew Human,
my studio developed\na custom script
that allows us to parametrically\nmodel the isovist, a changing
volume of vision defined by\nthe relationship of a moving
subject and a building envelope.
The isovist is dependent\non the relationship
between the total\narchitectural volume
and the position of the viewer.
The definition here,\nshown here, automatically
updates the isovist as\nthe viewing position
is moved around the volume.
The simplification of the\nroom's spatial features
heightens the\nperception of daylight.
As morning becomes afternoon\nand winter becomes spring,
sunlight creates a predictable\nset of fluctuations
in the visitor's visual field.
The isovist is also determined\nby these environmental factors.
In S-281913, two\nglass boundaries
reroute the flow of daylight\nthrough the room reshaping
the volume of visible space.
Daylight floods the window.
The clear plains become\nhighly reflective
surfaces when viewed from\ntheir illuminated face,
creating a predictable\nvolume of vision.
Upon entry through the\narticulated threshold,
the visitor encounters\nan illuminated image
of Biscayne Bay.
As the visitor passes\nthrough the threshold,
their isovist shifts\nand shifts again.
Simple changes in\nviewing position
radically alter the\nspace of the isovist.
What was moments ago\nreflective is now transparent.
Not only is the viewing\nposition of the viewer in flux,
the boundary is also\nmoving overlaying
the periodicity of\nillumination and procession
with a third temporal frame--
the motion of the\narchitectural apparatus.
The additional temporal\nvariable destabilizes
the perceived status of\nexisting boundary planes.
At the Perez, the\napparatus' axis of rotation
reoriented the ground\nand ceiling plane
within the visitor's\nvisual field.
The museum's iconic\nlighting grid,
seen here in this\nreflected ceiling plan,
is juxtaposed with the\nreflected view of Biscayne Bay.
Visitors were both\nviewers and actuators.
Manual manipulation shuffled\noverlapping temporal cycles
of illumination, procession,\nand boundary position.
Motion blurred the boundary\nof the artwork undoing
conventional relationships\nbetween viewer and viewer,
viewer and guard, and\nviewer and curator.
The movement of S-28 is\nderived from the more
conventional rotation of\nstandard architectural
elements, such as\nwindows and doors.
And examination of\nthe representations
of these time-based\ntechnologies calls attention
to the limits and possibilities\nof architectural drafting.
When it comes to the\nbuilding in motion,
drafting conventions are largely\nlimited to the representation
of a pivoting door.
The turning of a door is\ndrawn as an arc in plan.
This arc represents the total\npossible positions of a door,
the door at all times\n360 degree rotation
extends the arc into a circle.
When the trace of\nthis movement is
viewed in elevation\nor at eye level,
the circular path\nappears as a line.
While developing\nS-28, the studio
began to study the orientation\nof this rotational axis.
The geometry of the glass\nvolume in this early mechanized
prototype is based on\nthe insulated glass
unit, also known as an IGU.
Two layers of glass are\nseparated by two aluminum bars.
A volume of air is sandwiched\nbetween the glass planes.
By orienting the\naxis at 45 degrees,
the rectangular element rotates\nfrom vertical to horizontal.
This reorientation of\nthe axis of rotation
transforms the\napparent path of motion
from a circle to an ellipse\nin both elevation and plan.
The representational convention\nof multiple viewing planes,
naturalized in the four\nview ports of computer aided
drafting systems, became an\nessential conceptual guide
and methodological tool in\nthe project's development.
The point of view in a\nrepresentational system
became inextricably linked\nto the point of viewing
in processional space.
The orientation of objects\nand the position of bodies
developed relationally.
Not only does the\nglass boundary plane
rotate around this\ncentral axis, but
each internal mechanical\ncomponent also
rotates around this axis.
A detail of this mechanism\nis shown here in section
through the axial centerline.
In order to develop\nthese moving parts,
the studio constructed\nmultiple reference frames
within our digital\nand physical models.
Coordinate systems allowed\nfor rapid translation
between the world's vertical\naxis and each object's
primary reference frame.
These new frames of\nreference allowed
us to study the\nrelational transformation
of each component throughout\nits rotational path
and to predict\npotential interference
between the multiplicity\nof moving parts.
S-337473 the Wexner\nCenter for the Arts
examines, distorts, and\nexaggerates a very different
architectural frame.
The Wexner Center's\nexhibition spaces
literalize the\nlogic of rotation.
The building translates\ntwo different urban axes
into two divergent\nstructural grid lines.
Intersections between grid\nlines result in staggered pairs
of interior columns, seen here.
These columns\npunctuate and interrupt
the visitor's visual field\nwithin each gallery space.
S-33 realigns the column grid\nand the experiential axis
of procession along a\n45 degree grid in plan.
In order to twist the viewer's\nvisual and processional line
of approach, S-337\nrequired modifications
to the existing site.
The ramp wall, here,\nis lowered to allow
for sightlines between\ncirculation and exhibition
spaces.
A sheet rock volume is\nconstructed, enclosing the two
centrally located columns.
This central volume\nis approached
on its corner accentuating\npassage along either side.
Pivoting thresholds are\npositioned at 45 degrees
to the primary\naxis of procession.
Each threshold bridges and\nmarks this possible space
regulating flow between zones.
S-337473 is first\nencountered by the visitor
as they process upwards towards\nthe entry of the gallery space.
Positional change is activated\nthrough manual manipulation.
Like S-28913, S-337\nrotates along a 45 degree
axis in elevation.
Unlike S-28, rotation\naround this axis
transforms a lintel into\na column and back again.
In order to avoid collision\nwith the building envelope,
rotation is limited\nto 180 degrees.
The limited arc creates\nradically different
dynamic forces throughout\nthe rotational cycle.
Controlled acceleration\nand deceleration
became critical to the\nwork's dynamic trajectory.
The studio developed a script\nto explore rotational tolerance
parametrically.
Dimensions are\nnumerically defined.
The rotating element\ncan be reoriented
along the x, y, or z-axis.
The path of rotation updates\nautomatically as geometry
is modified.
And most importantly, collision\nduring rotation is marked.
And positional change is\ntraced as volumetric form.
The location of the joint along\nthe length of the rotating bar
can be moved to\navoid this collision.
In an ideal world,\nthe glass element
will have a constant velocity\nthroughout a full 360 degree
arc of rotation.
The digital model presents\nthe work in an ideal state.
Any imbalance due to material\nspecificity or sighting
creates irregularity\nin motion resulting
in significant changes in\nacceleration and velocity.
A study in equilibrium was\ndeveloped at the Wexner Center
in collaboration\nwith OSU's department
of mechanical engineering.
Here, sensors measure\nthe acceleration
in angular velocity\nresulting from unequal weight
distribution across\nthe axis of rotation.
The ideal model\ndemonstrates constant speed
throughout 360 degree rotation.
The red line represents\nangular position over time.
The blue line represents\nangular acceleration over time.
The black line represents\nangular velocity over time.
In this artificial state\nof dynamic equilibrium,
velocity and acceleration\nstay constant
as the element rotates.
In the empirical\nmodel, imbalance
across the rotational\naxis creates
eccentricities and movement.
How might equilibrium\nbe achieved?
When pivoting the\nartwork on site,
it became apparent that\nthe work was not balanced
across its rotational axis.
The script was further developed\nto address this imbalance.
Green volumes represent\npositive weight values.
Red volumes represent\nnegative values.
The volume of the counterweight\nchanges as its material density
and position are modified.
Adjustable counterweights\nwere buried within the cavity
between glass planes here.
Weights offset imbalance\nand return the piece
to a state of equilibrium,\ncalibrating threshold movement
over time.
At times, the threshold\nappears opaque
and at others, transparent.
Transparency is\ndetermined by the position
of the glass, the position of\nthe sun, and, in this case,
the position of the camera.
S-337 is constrained by\nthe building's boundaries.
Tightness and tolerance\nbetween the rotating elements
and the surrounding\nbuilding surfaces
generate spatial tension.
This tension between\nboundaries is
at the core of the studio's\nlatest investigations.
In S-011110, a\nhorizontal glass beam
rotates around a\nvertical glass column.
Had the beam been\nany longer, it would
have collided with the column.
S-011110 avoids\ncollision through
the dimensional constraint\nof the rotating element.
Beam and column are connected\nthrough a pair of linear rails.
The dynamic joint\nslides between the rails
and can lock into position\nat any point along the length
of the glass unit.
This linear track allows\nfor positional calibration
of the beam's center of mass.
During installation,\nthe beam's position
can be adjusted to achieve\ndynamic equilibrium.
And here you can see a detail\nof these locking linear rails.
This connection detail revealed\na remarkable opportunity
for future work or the future\nphasing of temporal change.
Here we see two dimensionally\nidentical models.
On the right is the original\n360 degree rotation.
On the left, an\noscillating linear movement
has been coupled with\nrotational motion.
The temporal coordination\nof linear and rotary motion
eliminates collision.
This temporal phasing is\ncritical to the perceived
relationship between boundaries.
The tighter the\ntolerance between
dynamic and static elements, the\ngreater the perceptual tension.
The timing between linear and\nrotary motion must be precise.
How might this phased\ntiming be developed?
Like the circular arc\nof the door swing,
the total possible positions\nof the moving element
must be analyzed.
The path of motion here appears\nas an elongated parabola.
Rotation is coupled\nwith linear oscillation.
For each 360 degree\nrotation, the plane
completes two\nlinear oscillations,
meaning it travels back\nand forth two times.
The path of motion\nis determined here,
or the difference\nin paths of motion
is determined here, by the\nphasing of temporal cycles.
Boundaries delimiting\nour environment
embody an\nextraordinary dynamism.
They both shape and are\nshaped by this temporal cycle
of the architectural frame.
This frame is a\ndetermining characteristic
of contemporary art.
The spaces of exhibition,\nthe logic of their operation,
and the iconic public\nface of the museum
increasingly determine\nforms of new work,
often fabricated\nspecifically for display
in museum galleries.
These institutions\noften rely on archives
of digital files, construction\ndocuments, capacity studies,
light and temperature analysis.
Computer aided design allows for\nthis information and proposed
alterations to the\nbuilt environment
to be shared between parties\nwithout material consequence.
The studio's use of Rhino,\nCAD, scripting, et cetera,
allows for a scalable\npractice that
integrates with these particular\ncontemporary conditions.
This integration\ninto conventions
of information infrastructure\nraises a central question
regarding the possibility\nof institutional tolerance.
Light projection\nand performance are
remarkably scalable\nand adaptable
to the architectural envelope,\nwell-suited to vast spaces
with relatively small budgets.
Institutional friction\nis often minimized
and context is erased by live\nbodies and moving images.
The methodology of\ndigital architecture
shares the scalable\npossibilities
of light projection\nand performance
but deviates at key points.
By adopting procedural\nmethods of architecture,
an artwork is able to operate\nwithin an evolved, preexisting,
codified system of information\nflow and material manipulation.
Friction arises\nprecisely at the moment
that the invisible\nrules underpinning
the architectural\nenvelope are questioned.
Importantly, this\nfriction is not
limited to the symbolic realm\nof building code, flow studies,
and structural requirements.
This symbolic\nsystem is materially
manifest in the inhabitation\nand the construction
of architecture.
Spatial manipulation\nhas the potential
to transform this\nsymbolic exchange
into an experiential\nreality, allowing
human actuators to reposition\ntheir architectural context.
Thank you.
[applause]
Sarah will welcome\nyour questions.
Hi.
Thanks for the talk.
Hello.
In the Perez Museum--
was that me or you or something?
Go for it.
In the Perez Museum\npiece, are you
saying that the guards or\nmuseum attendants were helping
them to rotate the pieces?
Yes.
OK.
That's it.
Thanks.
Hello.
Thanks for the lecture.
I would like to ask kind\nof a silly question.
Why are the metal parts black?
And what would happen if\nthey were different colors?
Thank you.
That's a really good question.
The metal parts, the\nblackness of the metal parts
has been a evolution.
But I have found that a matte\nblack surface is perhaps
the most effective way of\nerasing depth perception.
And because there's such\nextraordinary tonal contrast
often with the\nsurrounding space--
and this is particularly true in\nspaces that have white walls--
it affects a sort\nof dissonance where
you stop being able to read\nthe detail and the change
in geometry that's occurring\nwithin that black plane
or planes.
And I want to say one\nother thing to answer
the question about the guards.
I think something that\nisn't discussed here,
but would be a really\ninteresting sort of space
or topic for a\nlecture is how museum
inhabitation or the museum's\nvisitors' experience
is so highly curated\nalready by the presence of
and the interaction\nor the seeming non
interaction with the guard\nand the figure of the guard.
And these projects lead to a\nset of institutional questions
and negotiations\nthat were very much,
I think, stretching the general\nprotocol of the institutions
in question.
And the guards\nbecame sort of right
in the center of that\nconversation in a way that was
really interesting, I think.
Thanks for the talk.
Scott was right.
It's extremely architectural.
And I'm like very\nenvious of the fact
that you have like such\na clear goal in mind.
And as a result, you have a\nclear sort of empirical way
to judge the work\nwhether it achieves
this sort of optical effect\nthat you're striving towards.
That level of clarity\nin the intention, also
with your actual like modes\nof representation in terms
of the drawings that\nwe've been looking
at today and your extreme\nclose relationship
with engineering\ndetails and things
like that seems\nvery architectural.
The question I\nhave is that maybe
perhaps in that vein of\nart versus architecture,
there appears like a\ndeviation in the work.
Firstly, it seems like\nto me the primary goal
in the first half of the\nlecture with your interventions
on space the work itself\nlike completely disappears.
I was so like\novercome with a desire
to kind of like\noptically, spatially
understand what I was looking\nat that the actual thing itself,
your steel and glass\nintervention as a medium,
again it disappears.
Whereas in the second\nhalf of your presentation,
the sort of object of\nfocus totally shifts back.
And it's no longer\nsolely or primarily
about the sort of\nspatial reconfiguration,
but is about this\nmore sculptural
like calderesque thing.
And so I was wondering if you\ncould speak to that distinction
and what may have\nperhaps like inspired
that change of thought?
So I think that that's\na really rich question.
I think there's\na lot to be said.
So I'll try to\naddress it succinctly.
First, I think\nit's very important
to point out that for\neach of the projects--
that for all of the projects\nthat I spoke about today,
I think of there being\ntwo very specific kind
of conjoined moves, if we\nthink of them as a move.
One move is about the\nreconfiguration of the existing
situations such that\nyou can't actually
tell how it has been changed.
Or it is hard to name\nhow it is changed.
So for example, in the\nlast picture where,
or the last piece, S-011110--
I lose track of the titles--
it seems as if the space\nis sort of as found
and the piece has been\nimported into that situation.
And even to people who\nhad been to the space
multiple times in\nthe past, it probably
was perceived that way,\nmuch like the first piece
that I showed.
But what happened was,\nlike the first piece,
the beams were in a\nvery different position
in the ceiling.
So rather than\nshifting the boundaries
in the wall, what was\nshifted was the distance
of the ceiling from the\nstructural members that
ran through the ceiling.
And so the two moves,\nas I'm talking about,
one has to do with this kind\nof shifting of the existing
building envelope and the second\nhas to do with an insertion.
And part of the\nbalance there is always
how to make what\nyou make visible
and what you don't make visible.
And so there's a\ntremendous amount of work
that's actually not visible in\nthese works that are moving.
But it also became\nvery clear to me,
and is becoming clearer\nand clearer over time,
that when something moves,\nit's hard not to experience
it as entirely separate.
And so how that balance starts\nto play out in the future
is a question for me.
One of the thoughts that\nI had was like would it
be possible to combine these\ntwo different types of sculpture
so that if you were now\nfascinated with equilibrium
and things like that,\ncould you now reapply that
to the question of the wall?
So here is--
It's like The Matrix.
--the answer.
I am incredibly excited\nabout the coupling
of linear and rotary motion.
But the coupling need not\noccur in the same object,
meaning one thing can slide\nand one thing can rotate.
It's just about in\na machine world,
it's just about what's fixed\nin relation to what, basically.
So it could be that the\nglass rotates and the wall
moves out of the way.
And that relationship,\nthen, is really up for grabs
how that embedment\nworks and what is static
and what is moving.
So the answer is,\nyes, definitely.
I felt like a lot happened at\nthe very end of the lecture.
So I just kind of\nwanted to jump back
to something I'm thinking about\nwhere it seemed like you were
opening from the\nphenomenological
to the institutional framework.
and through the kind\nof time-based medium
of exhibition.
And I heard two other\ncharacters come up.
One was light projection and\none was performance and then
the kind of sculptural or\narchitectonic practice, which
might actually be both--
one of light reflection\nand performance.
But I was wondering, I\ndidn't quite understand
or didn't quite catch,\nwhat you were setting up
among those three terms of\nlight projection, performance,
and your practice in relation to\nthe institutional informational
framework.
So I'm happy to try\nto clarify that.
One thing that I have\nseen to be increasingly
the case in contemporary art\nis that the contemporary art
museum is addressing a\nvery different scale.
And it's also addressing a\nvery different set of problems,
which are not the\nproblems of showing
small, discrete paintings\nto a contemplative viewer
but of creating a kind\nof large social space
that is vastly overscale\nto the human body
and has some sort of iconic\nrelationship to urbanism.
And those spaces and the\ncurators of those spaces
are in a situation where it's\nvery challenging to, let's say,
fill them.
And the notion of filling\nthen becomes are really
like a troubling one--
as someone who is\nexpected to be a filler--
because it shifts\nthe possibility
of what are you doing?
And does that envelope,\nthen, radically alter
the direction of\nnot just what we
recognize as contemporary\nart, but also
what is being made\nas contemporary art?
And so one way that I think\nthat has been neatly dealt with
is to deal with moving bodies\nand light projection as ways
of filling spaces without\nmassive quantities of capital
being required to do it, like\nbuilding a huge second building
inside the first building.
And I think that\ndigital architecture--
what I mean by\ndigital architecture
is this possibility of\nplaying with the manipulation
of the building without actually\nmanipulating it materially--
is nicely within that paradigm.
It has no but like massive--
So it's a kin to performance.
Yes.
Yes, exactly.
Gosh, I wanted myself\nto ask you something.
I imagine you've been\nasked about this,
the possible association\nwith your work
has with that of, believe\nit or not, Matta-Clark.
I was just in Bronx to\nsee a great exhibition.
I don't really want\nto ask you whether you
agree there's an association.
I'm going to just put\nsomething on the table.
I was thinking-- I mean when\nyou mentioned the protocol
and stretching it, that's what\nreally brought it to my mind
again, because of\ncourse what he did
in overlaying his\nacts of destruction
on to buildings that\nwere being destroyed
and idealizing their\ndestruction and the way
he did, for example, by\ncarving a perfect sphere out
of the building in Paris while\nthe building is undergoing
demolition, et cetera.
You know, these\nwere very dangerous
and they were outside\nall kinds of-- anyway.
All kinds of issues\nof like working
outside the norms of\nwhat it meant to do
would with work like that.
But I thought it was very\ninteresting that you, too,
are doing something that\nis creating these problems.
But I think the reason,\nit seems to me--
and I think you just said it--
it's digital architecture.
I mean what was so poignant\nand so powerful for me was when
the giant beams were\nrotating-- and, of course,
the forms of rotation being\noverlaid is absolutely
essential as you've pointed\nout again and again--
you know, you were\nenacting what we all do.
The elastic transformation,\nthat scale 1D, everything that's
happening in our\nmodeling, is being
enacted but you are\nactually undergoing
experiencing the weightlessness\nthat is manifest.
I feel like are doing with\ndigital working of architecture
and the revision of\nthe digital model
that we do normally\nonly in modeling,
you're activating\nit in a manner,
for example, analogous\nin verse to what he
did with the physical\nundoing of buildings.
There's something to it.
I need to like\nthink through this.
It's kind of amazing.
Do you know what I'm\ntrying to get at?
It's like you're\nembodying a process that
was sort of never embodied.
We do it all the time,\nbut we can't embody it.
I mean the students are--
you know.
Look.
Right.
The way you're working is what\nwe're doing in our modeling
all the time.
When you said you\nlowered those ceilings--
So I have many comments.
Yeah.
But I think it is\nessential, and I
think an essential distinction\nthat these buildings are
inhabited, that these\nbuildings are lived in and used
and remembered and inhabited.
And I guess in some ways,\nit becomes very important
that these buildings\nare actively
inhabited through the\ntransformation that I sort of--
through the set of operations\nthat I perform on them,
let's say.
But I also think\nthat what you're
describing about this\nmaterial embodiment
of a digital manipulation\nis really interesting.
And that one of the key\nsurprises there is that so much
of what we think we know\ndigitally we don't know,
because there are so many\nproprioceptive experiences
that are absolutely vacated\nin any kind of screen display.
And so gravity, which is the\nthing that this rotation mostly
defies, and equilibrium,\nwhich then gives it
the grace of the impossible,\nis that's the non-visual key
to that transformation.
It's like it's not\na visual problem.
That's why equilibrium\nis at the core of it,
because it's at which that the\ndigital cannot simulate in some
felt way.
I don't want to hold\nthe floor anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah, really great stuff.
I was privileged enough to be\nat the opening of your work
at the Wexner gallery.
And it was truly\nremarkable stuff.
I was interested in the\nnaming of the projects.
I think that the act of the\nartist or the creative naming
their work usually\nhas implications
as to how they want\nthe work to be received
or something like that.
And to me, when\nI hear the names,
I sort of think\nof like the level
of precision required to make\nthese amazing pieces come
to life and to work.
But I was wondering if\nyou could speak on that
as to what the naming?
What informs the naming\nof your projects?
Yeah.
I would be happy to.
The naming has been in place in\nsome foreignness schematically
similar way for\nprobably 10 years--
or more now, actually.
And it evolved\nspecifically as a way
of thinking about the\nwork as not site specific.
And it had to do with\nthinking about how there
are basic rules underpinning\nthe organization
of architectural\nspace, such as, let's
say, a fluorescent lighting grid\nor different types of building
code, hand rail\nheights, et cetera.
And that had to do\nwith how every time I
would develop a\nwork, that work was
developed not so much\nfor that specific site,
but for a set of\nconditions which
could be found in any\nnumber of other locations.
And kind of the\norganizing principle
about those recurrent conditions\nis the idea of adjacency.
So the titles are\nbasically based
on a spreadsheet which starts\nwith a set of adjacent zones
and looks at the manipulation\nof the boundaries
as a possible\nvariable 0 through 9
for each column of the\nrow of numbers and talks
about how flow would\nact between those zones.
And that includes things\nlike air flow, light flow,
vision flow, bodily\npassage, et cetera.
Well, take one last one there.
OK.
Thank you for the talk tonight.
You showed us a lot of your\nwork which are interventions
in interior spaces.
I wondering if you\ncould talk briefly
about sort of the\nchallenges of working
with outdoor spaces, public\nspaces, things like that?
Well, there's lots of\ndifferent types of challenges
that I see in that let's just\ncall them exterior spaces,
some of which are\npublic or some of which
are perceived to be\npublic but are private.
I think one question that\narises for me is very much what
happens to the\nconditions of adjacency
or the conditions of a\nboundary when you move outside?
And also there are very\ndifferent histories
of art action or art\nproduction or sculpture--
I'm not sure how you\nwant to name this--
once you remove the\ninteriority of space.
And for me, both of those\nthings come into play
in thinking about\ntaking the work outside.
Additionally, and I think\nsomething very importantly,
is that the navigation--
let's call it\ninstitutional navigation--
but the navigation with the\nparties who control the space
are very, very different.
And I think those questions\nwould really, reshape
how I was dealing with project.
Well, Sarah, it's\nbeen wonderful.
Thank you.
And everyone I know is\nso excited about what
you're doing in the school.
It's been just a great\nexperience for all of us.
So, everyone, thank Sarah.
[applause]
Thank you.
