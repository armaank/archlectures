Hi, everyone.
My name is Nicholas de Monchaux.
I have been an MIT faculty\nmember for all of eight weeks.
I'm taking over as head of\nthe architecture department
here a little over\ntwo months from now.
This moment gives\nme an opportunity
to introduce myself\nto you, but also
to credit everyone who has\nworked so hard on this,
our first virtual lecture\nof the spring 2020 semester,
and one more small piece\nof the Herculean effort
that's taken our students,\nour staff, and our faculty
to rapidly and\nunexpectedly change
everything about what we do in\norder to keep doing what we do.
Even though we all might\nbe in our homes, none of us
are in our usual space.
Current students are\nstruggling with moving
their massive\ncommitments online into
claustrophobic bedrooms and\nclaustrophobic virtual rooms.
Our faculty and\nstaff is struggling
to keep MIT's vast virtual\narchitecture afloat,
while our studios lie empty,\nour gyms and shared spaces,
like the ice rink, are\nconverted into medical wards,
and our shops and production\nfacilities in architecture,
as well as all\nover the institute,
are converted to support\nBoston area hospitals by making
PPE and other clinical tools.
Earlier today I\ngave a presentation
to MIT's leadership\nand heads of department
about how our studio teaching is\nadapting to the current crisis.
Students and faculty are\nmaking amazing efforts,
but some of the most\nessential ingenuity,
like our new architecture\nstudent-run radio station,
WAWD, is a response to the\nbiggest loss we have right now,
and one that is essential\nto the culture of studios,
and to the culture of\nour cities as well.
This is not just doing\nwhat we need to do,
but the part of\nstudios and cities
which involves doing what we\ndidn't think we need to do,
but that turns out\nto be essential.
It's this part of student\nlife, the serendipitous,
the unexpected,\nthe seemingly fri--
excuse me-- frivolous\nthing that turns out
to be both marvelous\nand essential
that the current moment has\nwith so many other things
taken away from us.
This is why along with\nthanking those contributing
to the logistics of this\nevent, Amanda Moore, Kevin
Tierney, our current\nhead, Andrew Scott,
and of course, our\nspeakers, I would like
to thank most of all of you.
Precisely because you\ndon't have to be here,
but you're here anyway.
You are claiming for all of us\nthe necessity of the unexpected
and the unnecessary in education\nand everyday life both.
To our alumni here tonight\nand to our visitors
from other schools\nand institutions,
I'd like particularly\nto welcome you,
to thank you for\nhelping us widen
the circle of serendipity, and\nto use it to bring you either
back to MIT, or to visit\nMIT for the first time.
The unexpected\nand intense nature
of my first two months at\nMIT have challenged me,
even as everyone else is being\nchallenged all around us.
But I'm particularly\ngrateful for the ways
that these last eight\nweeks have shown me
that MIT Architecture is\nin us, a community far
more than a set of spaces.
It's a place that can\nexist in multiple ways
and exists here\ntonight thanks to you.
So this is a time\nto embrace things,
like an architecture lecture\nthat can seem normal,
and that can help us\nreclaim our professional
and intellectual identity\namidst so much uncertainty.
But it's not a time to pretend\nthat things are normal.
This is why I'm\nparticularly glad to share
with you that\ntonight's lecturers
Leslie and Sasa, former\nMIT students both,
are donating their honorarium\nfrom tonight's lecture
to a fund established by our\ndean's office for students
in need.
I would invite any of you out\nthere with any interest in this
to contact the dean's\noffice with any questions
about this fund or about\nhow all our efforts can
support our own and\nother communities in need
at this time.
Now to the business\nof tonight, which
is introducing our special and\nmost welcome guests, Leslie Lok
and Sasa Zivkovic.
Leslie is an assistant\nprofessor and the BR coordinator
at Cornell.
Allied with\ncomputational technology
and with a focus on urbanism,\nher research and teaching
explore the\nintersection of housing,
urbanization, and mass\ncustomized construction methods
at multiple scales.
She received her master of\narchitecture at MIT in 2011
and previously taught at McGill.
Sasa Zivkovic is an assistant\nprofessor also at Cornell,
where he directs the robotic\nconstruction laboratory, ,
an interdisciplinary research\ngroup that investigates
the implementation of\nrobotic-based construction
technology.
He received his\nMArch at MIT in 2012
when he was the recipient of\nthe AIA certificate of merit.
Prior to MIT, Zivkovic studied\narchitecture and city planning
in Stuttgart, where he\nwas awarded a fellowship
from the German National\nAcademic Foundation.
Sasa and Leslie's\njoint practice, HANNAH,
leverages and augments\nordinary technologies
for material, spatial, and\ncultural experimentation
in build projects across a\nwhole diversity of scale.
This amazing work is driven\nby tectonic and material
explorations in architecture.
It's a platform, as they\nsay, to unapologetically
test and explore personal\narchitectural obsessions
surrounding material misuse,\nforms, construction, concrete,
robots, trees,\ntoolpaths, and buildings.
The work is amazing.
And I would ask us to\nhonor in the absence
of in-person applause, and\nhandshakes, autographs,
and selfies, with questions,\nwith good questions supplied
by you tonight throughout the\nlecture via the webcast portal
and on Facebook.
The webcast portal, the\nquestions go right here.
And if you're\nwatching on Facebook,
they're somewhere\naround you as well.
We'll be taking questions\nthroughout the lecture.
So type them in as\nsoon as you have them.
And then we'll organize\nthem and ask them
at the end of the lecture.
So with that, over\nto Leslie and Sasa.
And thank you so much for\njoining us here tonight.
All right.
Thank you, Nicholas, for\nthis great introduction.
We're going to share our screen.
And we would also like to thank\nAndrew for the kind invitation.
Both Leslie and I are thrilled\nto lecture here at MIT
from Leslie's Cornell office.
And we send our greetings\nto the MIT community
during those challenging times.
As alumni, we would not be\npresenting our work tonight
if not for the amazing\npedagogical landscape that
is MIT.
So before we start\nthe lecture, we
would like to thank\nin no particular order
some of the people who\ndeeply influenced our work
and thinking.
[INAUDIBLE],, Nadir, Adele,\nYungho, Sheila, Andrew, Anna,
Ranjha, Liam, our thesis\nadvisor, thank you.
The title of our lecture\nis forms of making.
We think that making\nis fundamental to how
we operate as HANNAH.
From the ground up, digital\ndesign and fabrication
technologies are intrinsic\nto the making of our work,
facilitating fundamentally\nnew material methods,
tectonic articulations,\nenvironmental practices,
technological affordances,\nand forms of construction.
As architectural designers,\neight years out of school
and we're now\nlicensed, we consider
ourselves to be\nbiased generalists
rather than specialists.
The various projects\npresented in this lecture
combine a variety of\nmethods and material,
making geometries,\nand social narratives.
We build and embrace\nshared technology.
We also create open source\nconstruction machines,
which we argue inevitably\naffect how we think
and design through making.
In our work, we aim to mind the\ntension between machine means
and architectural\nends across scales.
And we reclaim authorship\nover processes of construction
that influence the way\nwe can build or perhaps
ought to build in the future.
At various scales,\nour work's performance
and architectural\nexpression are inherently
derived from materiality,\ndigital construction protocols,
robotic routines, and\nbottom-up design logics.
At the same time,\nin the mix of means,
our work is inspired\nby precedent, program,
ecological considerations,\ncollective labor,
personal obsessions, and\nthe misuse of technology.
Based on the title\nof our lecture,
we're also interested\nin the F word.
And we admit that openly.
When discussing the F\nword, Andrea Simitch,
our department chair at Cornell,\ntalks about informed form.
Augmented by information, form\nbecomes a malleable concept,
which implies that\narchitecture is
an interplay between\naesthetic values of design
and broader types\nof information that
act upon form, that\ncollaborate with form,
or that produce\nsynergies with form.
And how does making\ninform architecture?
How does environment,\ntechnology, program, history,
and their discipline\nitself inform
the making of architecture?
The following projects are\na work in progress and aim
to give expression\nthrough the design
to some of these questions.
We've spent the last five years\nbuilding an infrastructure
and framework for architectural\nexplorations across scales.
So starting from\nthe design of tools,
moving to the prototypes\nand installations,
and then combining on\nresearch into the construction
of a small building.
About five years\nago, Leslie and I
became interested in a\nnew method of making,
namely concrete 3D printing.
And after starting\na collaboration
with building industry,\nwe were disappointed
by the limitations at the time.
And so in order to\nconduct research
in advanced manufacturing and\nengage new methods of making,
one needs the facilities,\nthe means and tools
to do such work.
So on the left, you\ncan see the 3D printer
that Leslie and I built in\n2011 sitting on an MIT--
Studio desk.
Studio desk.
And on the right,\nyou see the printer
that RCL developed\nat Cornell in 2016
as part of an option studio.
The printer is\nfully open source.
And that is very\nimportant to us.
The printer runs\noff an Arduino board
with slightly modified firmware.
A 3D model parts list\nand wiring diagram
can be downloaded\non our website.
We think that fully\nunpacking the manufacturing
tool or machine is an exciting\nopportunity for architects
to reclaim authorship over\nprocesses of construction,
which fundamentally influence\nthe way we can build.
While the machine\nis only a framework,
our thesis is with\nnew tools come
new architectural opportunities.
We also believe that\ntechnology comes
with a social responsibility\nto make these tools broadly
available to all.
So this printer costs\nabout $6,000 to make.
It is very much inspired by\nthe open source movement.
And its realization\nis really only
possible because of the\ngenerous open source community.
And so we are interested in\ngiving back to that community.
The printer was built\nover a three-week period
in a collaborative\noption studio at Cornell.
And here you see the final\nphoto shoot of the printer
with Chris Battaglia in it,\nwho played a very big role
in the design and\nconstruction of the machine.
And after a period of material\ndevelopment and machine
modification, Daedalus\nis now able to print
full-scale building\ncomponents in foam,
recycled plastic, and concrete.
For us, this new\ntool opens the door
to novel architectural\nspeculation.
If there are any Cornell\nfriends visiting this lecture,
this is Rand Hall before\nthe library renovation.
Our interest in the\nprinting was in its process.
Like a three\ndimensional drawing,
the machine horizontally\ndeposits one line
after another.
And if lines are shifted\nthrough corbelling,
the printer creates\nspatial form.
Inherent in this\nrather simple process
is the complex\narchitectural language
of concrete 3D printing.
The 3D printer, a\nmachine which has long
been characterized as\ncharacterless due to having
little to no constraints, is\nin fact exactly the opposite.
It has plenty of\ncharacter, maybe too much.
In the project Additive\nArchitectural Elements,
our research question is,\nwhat is the architecture of 3D
printed concrete?
How can materiality and\nthe unique fabrication
opportunities and constraints\nof the tool inform the design?
And before we ask a question\nof what the architecture of 3D
printed concrete, let's look\ninto a prominent chapter
of concrete architecture\nwhich inspires us.
The development of reinforced\nconcrete around 1850
has enabled unprecedented\narchitectural expression.
Through the past\n150-plus years, there
have been various interpretation\nof what constitutes
an architecture of concrete.
We might think of heroic\ncantilevers, fluidity,
or a distinct articulation of\n[INAUDIBLE] form construction,
processes, and exposed\nconcrete structures.
Admittedly, our concrete\nelement from the previous slide
produces certain visual\nlinkages to Paul Rudolph's
rough striated [INAUDIBLE].
By association,\nwe ask ourselves,
what if anything do\nwe have in common
with such work of architecture?
And for us, our\nconcrete architecture
is most intriguing when\nthere is a symbiosis
between the material or the\nmethod construction demands, as
well as the idiosyncratic,\nwillful, and biased expression
of the architect.
The merging of the two\nirreconcilable worlds
of technical reason with\nexpressive intuition at times
produces moments of stunning\narchitectural brilliance,
beauty, and intellectual\nsatisfaction.
So in both our\nresearch and practice,
we aim to bring about and\nintroduce such balance
to new processes of making.
It's admittedly a\nwork in progress.
And building the\nmachine was perhaps
the easy part with the aim to\nderive an architecture that
is intrinsic to the additive\nmanufacturing process.
We experimented with dozens\nof initial concrete mixtures
and printing failures\nto understand
the materials and tolerance\nand this inherent urge
for imprecision.
When printing in\nconcrete, the same rules
apply in the small\ndesktop 3D printers,
but gravity takes on an\naltogether different role
in the process.
Cantilevers have to be\ncarefully constructed.
New support material strategies\nhave to be developed,
and toolpaths have to be\ncarefully manipulated.
We see this manipulation\nof 3D printing rule sets
as a tremendous opportunity.
Concrete printing\nrequires the development
of an entirely new\narchitectural language, which
takes into account the\nlimitations of the process,
as well as\nperformative advantage.
So in this project, it aims\nto reveal the 3D printer's
own and highly idiosyncratic\narchitectural tectonics
and narratives.
We chose prototypical motifs--
floor, column, door,\nwindow, wall, and ceiling--
and began to develop\nstrategies as
to how the layering of\nconcrete, this relentless three
dimensional drawing of\nextruded lines of material
and the act of\ncorbelling can suggest
new strategies for building.
So working with the\nconstraint of gravity,
this element here,\nthe mushroom column,
plays with cantilever\nover support material
by printing upside down.
The horizontal striation\nresults in structural assemblies
that seamlessly\ntransition between
the vertical and horizontal.
In the 3D printed structure,\nall common architectural motifs
and building components must\nbe rethought to fit the logic
of layer construction.
For example, a concrete printer\ncannot print in mid-air,
therefore the otherwise\nrather simple task of creating
a rectilinear window opening\nin the wall becomes a de facto
impossibility.
So rather than\ndrastically altering
the process, such as stopping\nthe machine to insert a beam,
shortcomings become\nopportunities for design.
So one logical\nconsequence for the window
is to cantilever\nincrementally, and become
a triangular corbelled arch.
And suddenly a seemingly\nadvanced technology
relies on obsolete or archaic\nstructural strategies,
such as corbelling.
In the case of this element,\nforce column, the modification
of printing direction, such\nas printing upside down
or printing a\nsection, is deployed
to overcome printer\ndeficiencies.
Printed in section,\nthe force column
hints at the potential\nto deposit material
where structurally necessary.
And the smart poche wall,\nsimilar to the force column,
explores some manipulation\nof concrete density
to optimize for\nstructural performance
and how it might begin to\nbe architecturally expressed
in the wall assembly.
The potential for\nexcessive ornamentation
is brought up in the adornment.
In the full-scale\nprototype we were
playing with\ndelamination of layers
to create screen-like\nmoments of transparency.
Ornamentation can also\noccur horizontally
in the floornament here.
Besides patterning,\nthe floornament
can be structurally and\nalgorithmically optimized.
3D printing also\nopens the possibility
of an integration of building\nsystems and furniture.
The sealing element\nis an expressive play
on ducts for ventilation,\nreflectors for lighting,
it becomes a performative poche.
There are multiple narratives\nat play in this project.
And we chose to present the work\nwith a particular speculative
focus.
We can also discuss their work\nin various other terms as well.
From a technical\npoint of view, there
are multiple advantages\nto 3D printing.
All of the elements'\ngeometries were constructed
without the use of form work.
So that constitutes a paradigm\nshift for concrete construction
and allows for a radical mass\ncustomization of buildings
and building components.
There is great potential\nfor material savings,
because 3D printing\ncan deposit material
where structurally\nnecessary, also,
an enormous advantage in a path\ntoward smarter construction.
Undeniably, there is a\ncertain formal agenda
at play in this project.
And bottom-up\nprocesses are highly
deterministic and\nimportant when it
comes to form making informed\nby the digital process.
Yet there are important\ntop-down decisions to be made,
which are harder to\nquantify, but necessary when
determining the architecture\nof 3D printed concrete.
We then explore\nhow we can deploy
the additive architectural\nelements in the building
context.
The Fabricate Lilong\nProject explores
the potential of\ncomputation of protocols,
such as additive manufacturing\nat the architectural scale,
[INAUDIBLE] housing\nat the urban scale.
The smart poche well is\nexpanded in the context
of multi-unit housing.
It can be densified\nfor structural load,
thickened for party\nwall, and attenuated
to meet the thinness\nof glazing transition.
The corb window element\nis explored here
as both window and entrance\nopenings at the housing scale.
And the ceiling element can\ninform individual modules
or organize into a\ncross-modular system
with mechanical connection\nacross multiple units.
Here the force column is\ntransformed into an integrated
wall and beams system.
At the cluster scale,\nsmart poche walls
are mass customized to address\ndifferent domestic functions
and expanded as poche cores\nfor utilities or circulation
that can be organized\ninto continuous rowhouses.
Apart from the typological\ntransformation,
the original spine organization\nof a linear semi-public space
is transformed into a weaving\nnetwork of semi-public alleys
and courtyard spaces.
So here, designing with the\nadditive architectural elements
at the housing scale can\noffer alternate inspirations
to build our city fabric.
The next project we want to\nshow is at the furniture scale,
informed fundamentally\nfrom the ground
up by new processes of making\nmateriality, and in this case
also a strange kind of program.
The Rolling Stones\nis the winning design
of the Folly/Function\n2018 competition sponsored
by the Architectural League of\nNew York and Socrates Sculpture
Park.
Conceptually, the idea of\na folly operates twofold.
The shapes and forms of the\nunfamiliar as cultural seating
object constitute\nthe first folly.
And the act of rolling to\nreveal new curvature and seating
profiles constitutes\nthe second folly.
And yes, it really\nis difficult to roll
a heavy concrete\nchair, as difficult
as it looks like in this slide.
So thank you, Alex and Chris.
Responding to the\nsite of the park,
the 23 seats can form a long\ncontinuous bench that becomes
a destination and place marker.
They can also aggregate\ninto smaller benches
or disperse entirely to form\ndifferent sized seating groups
or solitary compositions.
And they provide a range\nof scale and seating
configurations from stool to\nsmall chaise for the public.
We played with the\nsectional profile
to generate nine seating\nand lounging configurations
and three basic prototypes\nwith each turn revealing
new curvature and\nseating profiles.
Using the 3D printer to print\nin sections, number four rebar
is embedded between the double\nlayer section as reinforcement.
To enable the creation of\nthe cantilevered forms,
the seats' interior is\nsupported with a bed of gravel
during printing.
And the layer of gravel remains\nimprinted on each chair's
interior surface, giving\nit a geologic character,
and also providing an honest\nreading of the fabrication
process.
In this video, you can see\na little bit of the testing
and the design\nexplorations that we
did for this project,\nwhich started out
as this transformation\nof the long bench object.
And then the seats\nthemselves can be dispersed
in different ways in the park.
We tested different\nprinting methods,
but also looked at issues,\nsuch as reinforcement, which
you will see in the next video.
So this is the printing process\nwith the printer starting
on the first layer on\na sheet of plastic.
As you can see, it's a\nlabor intensive process.
Our machine is not\nfully automated.
So it requires a lot of\nmanpower to produce chairs.
We did a series of\nreinforcement tests
to establish what\nmethods might be viable.
This is one of\nthe first projects
that we used where rebar is\nembedded into the 3D print.
So here you see how it's made.
It's a double layer printed\nwith a manually inserted rebar
profile that has been custom\nwelded to fit the seating
profile of the chair.
So printing these chairs\ntakes about one full day.
And we have since\noptimized the process
for the second iteration\nof this project, which
is the Rolling Stones 2.0\nexhibit at the Momentary, which
is a subsidiary of the Crystal\nBridges Museum of American
Art in Bentonville.
So besides exploring the\narchitectural potential
of horizontal layer\nprinting, we are also
interested in developing new\nprocesses of manufacturing
at the lab.
So at RCL, based on--
sorry-- at RCL, based on Chris\nBattaglia's M.Arch thesis
project, we developed a spatial\nmethod of concrete 3D printing,
where the concrete gets\ndeposited on a support
material, in this case gravel.
Sub-additive 3D printing\nis a fundamental deviation
from the standard process\nof 3D printing, which
is a horizontal deposition of\ntwo paths layer upon layer.
And we showed that in the\nvarious other projects prior.
For certain complex geometries,\nlike shells, this method
has severe disadvantages.
Depositing cementitious material\non a supportive aggregate
is not a new thing.
The Philips Pavilion at\nthe Brussels Expo '58
was one of the first\nmodern examples
to panelize a large complex\nsurface through land forming.
So casting on a shaped\nhyperbolic sand form,
multiple panels were\nproduced as sections
of the surface,\ntransferred to the site,
and then post tensioned to\ncreate the iconic structure.
And so here's what's smart about\nthis construction technique.
The same machine that\nprints the concrete
is used to create the\nflexible gravel form work.
So in the first\nstep, the printer
creates a surface that matches\nthe curvature of the thin shell
geometry, making\nits own form work.
So this is what you see\nhere, a tennis ball shaping
the gravel mound, and\nthen shaping the lines
for 3D printing.
And then in the second\nstep, the concrete material
is deposited on the\nreusable gravel form work.
So this is the first panel\nthat Chris 3D printed
with two layers of concrete.
And so with this\nmethod, one can rapidly
print highly mass customized\nand optimized grid
of thin shell structures.
Printing this with a horizontal\nlayer deposition method
is a difficult proposition.
And so here you see\nthe excavation process
and some final results of\nChris's thesis project.
This printing process\nhas been translated
to also work with the robot.
And it's a bit messier than\nwe would like it to be.
We have since\ndeveloped a new method
to machine or post-machine\nthese pieces using a CNC Mill.
This is something that\nwe cannot show today,
but if you're interested\nin knowing more about this
project, we brought a\npaper for [INAUDIBLE],,
and also have more\ninformation on the website.
Using the 3D\nprinter's flexibility,
we can use form finding methods\nand structural optimization
to determine the\nlattice density required
at each point\nwithin the surface.
So depending on the\nshape of the structure,
we get different\nlattice patterns, which
also reduces waste material.
In our research in the\nlab and in the practice,
we think it is paramount to\ntest full scale prototypes.
So this is a mockup of\nsub-additive printed arches.
Each component weighs\nroughly 150 kilograms
and was printed in\nthe span of one hour,
and can be rolled up\nfor easy assembly.
As a new method, sub-additive\nprinting leverage digital
workflows to produce\nstructurally, materially,
and spatially optimized building\ncomponents, while dramatically
reducing waste material.
Contextually, the\nsub-additive project
expands on a lineage of\nthin shell structures
by the likes of Nervi,\nCandela, Isler, or Dieste.
So we are currently working\non improved printing accuracy,
the integration of\nfiber reinforcement,
and novel cement\nmixtures that don't have
a massive environmental impact.
And the latter point, I\nthink, is very important,
because we cannot sustain\nconcrete as a building material
by saving material alone.
So the concrete has\nto fundamentally
be rethought in the\ncontext of 3D printing
to become a viable building\nmaterial for the future.
So here back to the tools,\nbecause a concrete printer
can only get you that far.
Compared to other\ninstitutions, the RCL lab
has very limited resources.
So we have to be inventive\nwhen it comes to equipment.
As it turns out, one can\ngo to eBay and purchase
a used Kuka KR 200 for $8,000.
And this is how it arrives.
The robot was formerly\na welding robot for GM,
producing cars in a\nplant in Louisiana.
While the machine\nis proprietary,
it was important for us to\nkeep the rest of the project
open source.
In terms of cost, it is hard\nto find a cheaper robot.
A certain amount of\nhacking is required
to make this robot work for\narchitectural production.
All information on\nhow to set this up
is available on the RCL website.
And in an ACADIA paper\nwritten by the lab
called "Open Source Factory."
For us, this robot\nhas enabled research
beyond the three axis\nconstraints of the 3D printer
and is a new technological\nmeans to inform
form and new material.
So Log Knot is a\nproject that emerged
from our first initial\nexploration with custom
wood-based tools for the\nrobot that Leslie just showed.
And wood is an\ninteresting material
because it surrounds\nus in so many ways.
As a building material,\nwe encounter wood
in the shape of two\nby fours or plywood
or other standardized\ndimensions.
But as this image shows,\nwood comes from trees
that are usually non-standard.
Log Knot is a\nrobotically fabricated
architectural installation which\naims to expand and optimize
the use of entire trees\nand irregular timber
geometries and construction.
The research team, which\nincluded Brian Havener,
a research associate, who did\nthis project in his M.Arch
studio, and then continued\nto work on it as a research
associate in the lab.
The team examined\nwhether regular--
irregular roundwood\ngeometries can
be processed to construct\ncompound curvature assemblies.
The project creates\nan infinite loop
of roundwood curving three\ndimensionally along its length.
And the project\nborrowed strategies
from traditional wood\nbuilding and manufacturing
while implementing\ncontemporary technologies
to achieve precision\nand mass customization.
Components are\ncomputationally processed
to form a spatially\ncomplex figure eight knot.
This is a series of\ndiagrams and studies
and a conceptual\nmodel on the site.
In a reciprocal design\nprocess, the project
fosters synergies and feedback\nbetween material fabrication,
digital form, and full\nscale construction.
New technological\nparadigms, such as
robotic-based fabrication,\nradically challenge
our understanding of wood\nas a building material,
but have yet to take\nbetter advantage of wood
as a sustainable and smart\nmaterial for construction.
Small roundwood members or tree\nforks are usually not utilized
for construction purposes\nbecause today sawmills are not
equipped to process those\nirregular tree geometries.
So this project uses\ncomputation to optimize
each joint for tension forces.
And each of the\njoints is precisely
rotated to resist forces\nand local buckling.
Here you see a detail of the\nvarious mortise and tendon
joints that we tested\nfor the project.
Each joint is secured\nby three lag bolts.
And Log Knot is designed\nfor disassembly,
therefore relying upon the\nuse of steel lag bolts instead
of wooden dowels.
The fabrication was done\non our Kuka platform
using a custom CNC\nmill and effector.
The mill first creates a\nplanar surface on the log,
and then creates the mortise\nand tendon rough cut.
We then use the\nside of the end mill
to smoothen the rough cut,\nwhich saves a lot of time,
and is an efficient way of\nutilizing the tool that we have
at hand and the end effector.
And to prevent\nchecking and shaking,
the milled end grains were\ncovered in pentacryl, which
is a non-toxic wood stabilizer.
And so this prevented\nchecking, and allowed
us to assemble these pieces\nmore or less accurately.
As we worked with\nsmall budgets, we
did not have access\nto heavy machinery,
and therefore developed a\nself-sufficient construction
method that requires only\nminimal form work or support.
So the idea was, can\nwe design a joint
that is so smart that it guides\nthe shape and form of the wood
assembly?
So each component was\nlifted and placed by hand.
And while we think\nconcrete is heavy,
wood is also surprisingly\nheavy in these dimensions.
So this is a\nconsiderable effort.
And then in the second step,\nwe fastened the wood in place
using the geometry of the joint\nto guide the form of the arc.
So here you see a video\nof the assembly process.
And so to hold up the\nstructure during construction,
all that is required is a\nminimal support of attached two
by fours.
So you see them emerging at\nthe top of the frame, the two
two-by-fours nailed\nto the wood structure
to give some additional support.
Unfamiliar notions of\ncraftsmanship and precision,
both digital and analog,\nemerged from Log Knot's
conceptual design practice and\ncharacteristic construction
technique.
Log Knot was exhibited as part\nof Cornell's 2018 Biennial
called "Duration--
Passage, Persistent, Survival,"\nand addresses this theme
on multiple levels.
Environmental cycles,\nbirth, growth, and decay
are intrinsic to complex forest\necosystems and processes.
Conceptually and spatially,\nthe Log Knot project
references these internal cycles\nand reciprocal relationships
between systems, both\nnatural and technical.
The infinite looping\nstructure is an interplay
between archaic natural\ngeometry, advanced computation,
and state of the art\ndigital fabrication.
By questioning how forests\nare used as a resource,
Log Knot provides a\ncritical commentary
on various perpetual\nwood cycles--
economic, environmental,\nand cultural in nature.
From the ground up, new material\nmeans and construction methods
are intrinsic to the making\nof this last project.
The Ashen Cabin\nrecalibrates expectations
around digital\nfabrication methods,
and out of contextual\nnecessity explores
the architectural opportunities\nof digital-analog construction
hybrids from the ground up\nto the scale of the building.
And informed by multiple\nforces, the building
follows two strands of\nmaterial narratives.
It is 3D printed from\nconcrete and clothed
in a robotically fabricated\nenvelope constructed
from irregular wood logs.
The making of the\nbuilding is also
informed by the key\nenvironmental crisis
of the ash trees\nin North America.
Since its discovery\nin the US in 2002,
the emerald ash borer killed\ntens of millions of ash trees,
drastically transforming\nthe entire forest ecosystems
in the process.
The EAB threatens to\neradicate nearly all
of the 8.7 billion ash\ntrees in North America.
And as of October 2018,\nit is found in 35 states
and several Canadian provinces.
As a reference, 10% of all\ntrees in New York state
are ash trees.
So that is almost 1 in 10 trees\nyou see will die or are dying.
And this is a huge problem.
And our means of\nconstruction might
contribute to some form of\ngruesome, after-the-effect
remedy.
In the first material\nnarrative, the 3D
printed concrete\nstructure is characterized
by three programmatic areas--
a table, a storage seat\nelement, and a 6.5 meter
tall working fireplace.
It has a footprint\nof 3 by 3 meters
and lifts off the ground\non printed legs, which
adjust to the sloped terrain.
The legs are printed in\ncomponents and function
as sacrificial zero\nwaste form work
for the main structural\nsystem to eliminate
substantial construction waste.
It used a cast-in-place concrete\nstructure with custom rebar.
This slide here shows the\ninterior of the concrete leg
with inserted rebar cage.
And the drone photo here showing\nthe nested modules on site.
They're also nested so that\nthey can be transported
fairly easily on the truck.
And here's a top view of\nthe [INAUDIBLE] structure
with the rebar cages.
Each leg is then filled with\nfoam in the void of the legs.
And concrete is poured in\nbetween to form a structure.
And going up, here's the\nassembly of the chimney.
We have turned into\nlittle contractors
with our scaffolding.
The cabin here, as you\ncan see, is expressive.
And corbelling becomes\na generative motif.
There is a tectonic\nexpression that
is generated by the fabrication\nmethod and materiality.
You can see the underside\nof the cabin showing
the corbelled legs connecting\nto the terrain on nine points,
actually one of which\ndoes not touch the ground.
In deliberately designing\na cabin and not a pavilion
or installation,\nwe have to address
border architectural\nconsiderations, such as,
how does the building\ntouch the ground?
How do we 3D print a fireplace?
Similar to the window\nelement, corbelling
is used to produce the opening\nof the working fireplace.
And here the articulation\nof the horizontal striation
is used as a tectonic\nstrategy to produce
seamless vertical\ntransition from the leg
to a 4-inch concrete slab, and\nfinally to the chimney above.
The [INAUDIBLE] code\nand printed path
are exploited in the ornamental\npattern of the 3D printed floor
slabs.
The slabs are also organized\nin a nine-square grid,
reflecting the interlocking\npattern of the legs beneath.
And finally, here\nis the envelope
that slides from trees to\nquestion preconceived notions
about material\nstandards in wood.
In 2018, the EAB\narrived at Cornell.
In order to use such\ntrees in construction,
we developed a new process\nto build the wood envelope.
Available ash\ntrees are harvested
from the Cornell Arnot Forest.
And by implementing\nhigh precision
3D scanning and robotic-based\nfabrication technology, as you
can see here, irregularly\nshaped waste wood
is transformed into an\nabundantly available,
affordable, and\nmorbidly sustainable
building material\nfor the anthropocene.
Utilizing the Kuka KR 200 robot\nwith a custom five horsepower
band saw and effector,\nwe can robotically
slice irregular tree logs\ninto naturally curved boards
and strategically assemble\nthe boards to form a variety
of surface conditions.
The boards follow the geometry\nof the naturally bent logs.
And they can be\nsliced into various
and also varying thicknesses\nup to 2 millimeter thin.
Also, by adjusting the\nthickness of the cut,
the robotically\ncarved timber boards
can be assembled as complex\nsingle curvature surfaces
or double curvature surfaces.
Here you see this drawing\nshows the number of logs
that were harvested from\n10 trees at the forest.
And a quick GIF showing\nhow one of the logs
can be sliced according\nto the fork geometry.
Geometric form finding\nand assembly protocols
from form to log and\nlog to form have been
developed for this project.
We started with an\ninitial massing design,
and then according to the\nlog that we have sourced,
the log curvature\nserved as a feedback
into the finalized\ndesign forms, that there
is a reciprocity between\nthe top down design and also
the available raw resources.
And the system was\nelevation drawing
Architecturally, the\nnatural bent wood planks
create the enclosure.
And the curvature of the\nwood is strategically
deployed to highlight moments\nof architectural importance,
as you can see in this diagram.
And so no longer\nbound to the paradigm
of industrial standardization,\nsuch as a wooden two-by-four,
this project revisits\nbygone woodcraft and design
based on organic found\nand living materials.
How can irregular\ntimber geometries
be used to create a fully\nfunctioning, ventilated,
waterproof, and insulated high\nperformance building envelope?
How does the envelope\nturn corners?
What are the detail connections\nbetween wood and concrete?
How are windows integrated\ninto the wall system?
And how can the natural\ncurvature of the log
inform an awning,\nan entrance, a door
handle, or highlight\na corner opening
for an extremely articulated\ndrain spout or frame views?
Technically, the\nenvelope functions
similar to the logic\nof a SIP panel.
The panels are insulated using a\ntwo component closed-cell foam,
which is fully biodegradable.
The facade assembly\nis fully ventilated
and is detailed to manage\nshrinkage and transformation
of wooden boards to offset\nthe air drying process,
and does not require an\nadditional rain screen.
And here's a view of the\ninterior of the cabin.
This shows the ceiling\nand the roof structure
of the cabin using--
combining with a typical\ntwo-by-six rafter.
The cabin combined a variety of\nfabrication methods, material
applications, geometries,\nand types of construction.
So at various scale, the\ncabin's performance, structure,
and architectural\nexpression is inherently
derived from these\ndigital construction
protocols, robotic routines,\nmateriality, and design logics.
And together, the various and\nsometimes conflicting means,
robotic or otherwise,\ninherently inform
the form and the architectural\nexpression of this project.
It is important to\nemphasize that this occurs
at the scale of a\nbuilding from ground
up using newly invented\nforms of making.
Thank you.
And we also want\nto thank our team,
because while it's the\ntwo of us presenting,
this work would not be possible\nwithout a very big team
of highly dedicated students,\nformer students, research
associates, and\nresearch assistants.
So thank you, guys.
Those are also your projects.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So we've finished a bit early--
10 minutes.
We thought, as this is a\ndigital format lecture,
we don't want to go over.
So this might give\nus a bit more time
for questions or an earlier\nend to our evenings.
Well, thank you.
I just want to thank\nyou all so much.
As I said in my\nintroduction, these
are not normal times, nor times\nto pretend they're normal,
but the kind of inventiveness\nand imagination of the work
allows us to think about\nall kinds of possibilities,
including for new kinds of\nwork and new kinds of being,
even amidst all sorts\nof uncertainties.
So I really want to express\ngratitude on behalf of myself,
of the community, the school,\nand of the over 700 viewers
that we've had with us this\nevening for the lecture,
which is just an\nastonishing testament to you
and a testament to this\nlarger community as well.
I wanted to start--
I think we have all learned\nabout the differential
staminas of online and in-person\nevents over the last few weeks,
but we'll push this\na little bit further,
because we've also got lots of\nquestions from the audience.
And I guess before\nwe even go to those,
I wanted to ask you to\ngo back to the F word,
to the very beginning\nof your lecture,
and some thoughts about form\nand form related to two ideas
that we're all grappling\nwith at the moment, which
is certainty and uncertainty.
We had a moment in\nthe very first flush
of parametric\ndigital architecture
in the last few decades\nof a kind of profusion
of form, and form about\nwhich lots of things
were all too certain and\ndeterministically made.
And I guess one thing\nI very much appreciated
about the work, but\nI wanted to prompt
you to talk about\na little bit more
is a kind of an\nabundance of form,
but an abundance of\nform that juxtaposed
the ability of digital\nshapes to expand, overlap,
multiply, and create a\ngreat deal of complexity,
complexity that hearkens back to\nthe low cost of labor of things
like the King's College\nChapel, but then
a different kind\nof complexity that
makes me think of the origins\nof the Land Art Movement
at Cornell that your Log\nKnot project is obviously
a tribute to as well,\nand the idea of entropy.
Gordon Matta-Clark\nand Robert Smithson
met on the Cornell campus.
And the kind of\nprofusion of form
that comes from the\noperation of entropy
is often seen as\na kind of contrast
between the deterministic\nnature of digital form.
But in your work, the two are\nvery much in collaboration.
So I wanted you to--
part of what makes the\nconcrete work beautiful
is the mistakes or\nthe uncertainties
around the precision and that\nsort of surround the precision
in the process.
And the same is obviously\ntrue in the beautiful cutting
of logs and the entropy of\nliving forms and knots and all
the rest.
So that question of form\nand certainty/uncertainty
seems to be--
to run very deep in the work.
And I wondered if you could\nreflect a little bit more
explicitly on it while I\nhave a moment to get together
everybody else's questions.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you for that question.
I think for a while, it was\ndifficult to talk about form
in our discipline, because it\nmight have been sort of misused
within a certain kind\nof moment of time.
But I think that was also--
that was necessary for that\nparticular discourse project.
I think what differentiates\nhere our work is this connection
to materiality.
And this is by no means a kind\nof solitary invention of ours.
So there are many fellow\ncolleagues and offices
that are deeply\ninvested in materiality
and form and digital\nform, and perhaps
in architectural expression.
So I think the certainty or\nuncertainty in these project
comes through the material,\nwhich brings its own
challenges, and which\nsometimes work in your favor,
and sometimes don't, which\nsometimes produce happy
accidents, and sometimes don't.
And so that gives it something\nconcrete to push back, I think.
And so the materiality\nis a really important
determining factor in the work.
What I want to point\nout is that for us it's
important, especially\nin the last project,
that we apply these\nmethods of material form
making to the scale\nof a building,
because that expands\nthe discourse
and brings other issues to\nthis kind of research, which
usually has a tendency\nto focus on prototypes,
or to focus on installations,\nor to focus on sort of smaller
scale investigations and has\nyet to arrive in many cases
at the building, which comes\nwith its own constraints
and issues that kind of\ncontaminate the diagram.
And I think also--
and to address that,\nthere are more than just,
let's say, our\nwillful desire for
a particular formal expression\nthat we have to engage with.
So direction-- I mean, as simple\nas, again, direction of roof.
How do we produce an interesting\narchitectural strategy
that connects with the ground?
So I think a lot of\nthese other, let's say,
challenges,\nconstruction challenges,
also inform the form.
So the process of making,\nso there is the material,
but there is also then what we\ncan make, and what we can test,
and what we can\ngenerate that allows
us to play with the form.
That's great.
I'm now going to move to\nquestions from the audience.
And I'm going to synthesize\nand put a couple of questions
together in the\nnext two questions.
There are some really\ninteresting questions-- one
from Pamela Tang, who's the head\nof our Alumni Association, who
I'm delighted to\nsee here, and then
another question\nfrom another audience
member about traditional\narchitectural techniques
as they relate to this process.
So there's a question\nabout study models
and the role of modeling,\nboth digitally and otherwise
in the process.
And then there's another\nreally interesting question
about drawing.
When you're moving so kind of\npromiscuously between planning
section and thinking about\nhow these things are made,
does it relate to how you think\nabout objects and environments
and planning section as you also\ndeploy more traditional media?
So drawings and\nmodels in the process.
I think models is--
our model testing has\na big range of scale.
So we have the traditional--
your hand size, let's\nsay, massing models
that you play with, but I think\noftentimes we engage much more
with like prototyping scale,\nso looking at half scale,
for example, in the cabin\nproject when we want
to test out the log design and\ngeometry to really figure out
the building system.
The layering, we\nactually have to-- we
produce a half scale\ncorner prototype.
So I think model making becomes\na really, really integral part
of the design.
And then playing with both at\nkind of the design study model
scale, and also actually\nat the material scale
is really important.
It allows us to test out, "Oh,\nthe wood is cracked," or, "Oh,
wow.
This is really,\nreally heavy," when
we thought it would be\nlighter when you're playing
with smaller trees and logs.
And then once you\nsquish a big log,
then you realize\nhow heavy it can be.
Regarding drawings\nand representations,
what we found interesting\nabout the printing process
is that it is very\nsimilar to drawing,
because it's the deposition\nof line up on line
to build a three\ndimensional form.
So in a funny way, these\nare sort of sketches,
the prints that we do.
This is all very much\nwork in progress.
I think you can see\nthe sort of roughness
of some of these\nexperimentations,
for better or worse.
And so I think drawing\nsort of through model
is something that\nwe are interested
in these explorations.
Regarding the question\nof traditional building
precedents, I think\nthis is something
that we tangentially\nmentioned in the presentation
and would probably\nneed a bit more backup
and sort of thoroughness to\nbe developed into a stronger
argument.
But we do think that, for\nexample, the use of roundwoods
in construction, or the\nuse of irregular members,
we could have shown sort of\nthe German Fachwerkhaus series.
So there is a legacy\narchitecturally, but maybe
also in some of the design\ndisciplines or engineering,
such as shipbuilding and so on,\nthat these projects reference.
And certainly we have\nlooked at that without now
explicitly pointing\nit out in the lecture.
So these references are\nfloating around in the work,
I would say.
And also maybe referring\nback to the one
of the questions\nabout drawing, you
were talking about\nmodes of representation
and how that plays\nin, let's say,
the process of the making\nof some of these projects.
And I think because of what the\ndigital tool allows us to do,
sometimes in certain cases--
and a lot of it can be\ndue to time constraints--
you bypass technical drawings.
So in the case of the\ncabin, from the design
to the building, there\nis some level of,
let's say, drawing in terms\nof plans and sections,
but in terms of making\nand building the building,
since we are designing it,\nbut we're also building it
ourselves, there is that one\nlevel that is kind of taken out
normally when you have\nan architect designer,
and you give it to a contractor.
And the drawing needs to\ncommunicate in that stage
to construct something.
And the cabin in that case,\nduring the construction
process, the drawing was\nmore of an exploration tool,
rather than a means of\ncommunicating how to build it.
So in the prototypes or\neven in the concrete part,
a lot of the time it was\nwe'd go from the 3D model
then to the print\npaths, and then
to the actual 3D\nprinting and construction
of the physical object.
So the drawing part, in\nsome cases, are bypassed.
And then the question\ngoes back to,
after we build the building,\nhow do we share it?
How do we represent\nit with the community?
And so then there\nis a return back
to drawing it using\nconventional drawing standards.
In the case of\nthe Rolling Stone,
we also went back--\nactually started
a machine-drawing project\nthat we didn't share here,
because we started to\nquestion, how do you
represent a 3D printed object?
And using the conventional plans\nin section doesn't fully, let's
say, translate or express the\ndesign logic of this 3D printed
project in that case.
Just a quick follow-up to that.
One of the-- so we struggle\nwith this question of drawing,
I would say.
So Leslie outlined some\nof the struggles going
from digital to prototype.
So in some ways,\nas I've said, we
conceptualize drawing\nthrough the model.
But what is missing,\nand we think
is a kind of missed\nopportunity, is using
drawing as a generative tool.
And its role as\na generative tool
is kind of submerged in here.
So that's why we\nthink the model is
a generative tool in our case,\nbut we are exploring ways
currently in these projects\nto think about drawing
as a generative tool.
So you think about the\nmachine and the drawing
in combination as\na generative tool.
And so these are some of\nour next research steps.
I'm going to ask\na quick follow-up
question that's also come up.
But does the idea\nof drawing relate
to how you're actually\nspending your time now
when so much of us\ndon't have access
to the tools and shops\nand large equipment
that we think and work with?
So currently we are\nworking in the office
on scaling up some\nof these projects.
So we would like to 3D\nprint a residential project
and a sort of housing\nproject following thereafter.
So this requires a\ncertain set of, I guess,
conventional design methods.
I think by now we have\ndeveloped an understanding
of some of these material\nprocesses and behaviors
that we can take\nthem into account
while drawing and designing.
And so that's kind\nof maybe an intuitive
layer that has emerged within\nthe practice that substitutes
for some of the model making.
But it is unfortunate that we\ncannot access our shop right
now like so many others.
The robots are\nsitting and waiting.
Taking a break.
They're sleeping.
I would-- so back to the\nrobots, there's a lot of people
in the questions interested\nin the actual physics
of production and materiality,\nand everything from,
can you can you print rebar to\nsome technical questions around
how--
whether you're experimenting\nwith or collaborating
with others at Cornell on\nmore sustainable or different
concrete mixes.
How much of the\npractice at this point
is involved in that\nmateriality and experimentation
about materiality?
And how much of it is\nrelated to the questions
of process and form that\nwe were also talking about?
Well, the RCL\nsession is actually
currently collaborating\nwith researchers at Cornell
in engineering and\ndesign and looking
at using different natural\nfiber as reinforcement.
It is one has to address that\nultimately cement or sand are
limited resources.
And we have to rethink\nthe composition
or the mixture of such.
And this is what is so great\nabout interdisciplinary
collaboration.
That's not something\nthat, let's say,
an architect or designer\nalone can address.
So there is\ndefinitely that strand
that we are pursuing and\nlooking at how we can
think at the material scale.
And in terms of the sort of\ntechnicalities and material
printing rebars, one thing is--
maybe we have slightly\nmentioned it in the lecture,
that the making of\nthe Rolling Stones
is actually quite labor\nintensive, because we
have to gravel the\npieces while we print.
And it's not a fully\nautomated process.
And I think that comes down\nto our priority of what we're
interested in exploring and the\nway the printer was constructed
as a method and as\na tool to explore
what we're interested in\nexploring architecturally.
So it wasn't our\ninitial intention
to design like a full\nstreamlined automated system.
So we were interested in\ndeveloping and hacking,
to an extent, to allow us\nto do what we like to do.
So therefore, in\nterms of, let's say,
different material,\nprinting multiple material
at the same time, we definitely\nsee the possibilities.
And there's ongoing--\nplenty of ongoing research
that does that.
There's already research\nat other institutes
that looks at robotically\nwelding rebar and so on.
So those technologies exist.
However, they don't\nplay yet and occupy
this sort of larger space\nin our work currently.
To follow up on\nthat, I think there
may be two components\nto this question.
So one is besides\ncollaborations in academia,
we're interested\nin collaboration
with the building industry.
And I think to scale up some\nof these processes of making,
one has to engage\nbuilding industry
at a fundamental level.
And this transformation\nwill take time.
The building\nindustry is changing.
It's one of the last sort\nof non-automated industries.
And so for better\nor worse, I think
this will come as a\nprocess in the future.
So automation will\narrive in construction.
And I think it's important that\nwe as architects have agency
in it by becoming experts\nin some of these tools
and technologies.
There's a lot of questions\non how things scale up.
Obviously, we're not just\ngoing to get an enormous robot
to attack a redwood tree.
So how do you scale up the\nmeans and scale of the work
while keeping the\nprecision of the knowledge
and understanding that you've\ndeveloped at the scales
that you have?
I think the way\nthat we've done it
or have been doing it\nis to recognize what
are the positive-- what are the\npros and cons of, let's say,
a particular tool\nand material system,
and leveraging what is good\nabout it and what it can do,
and not try to force\nit to do everything.
So meaning that, let's\nsay, in the cabin,
the envelope is\nrobotically fabricated,
but the roof structure\nin the end that we used
was a rather simple roof\njoist sort of construction
with rafters and\nso on and so forth.
So we definitely\ncould apply also
the same robotically\nslicing for the roof,
but I think recognizing--
well, due to time\nconstraint as well--
when we should deploy the robot,\nand when we can customize,
and then when can we\nalso take advantage
of traditional and conventional\nbuilding techniques?
So it's not about\nreinventing the wheel,
but finding a smart and\nsmarter way to customize,
and in this case mass\ncustomize, using our tools
and material at\nthe larger scale.
And I think to scale up, we have\nto understand and acknowledge
the shortcomings and advantages\nof specific tools and material,
and use it to their advantage.
And we can't\ndisclose any details,
but there are big printers\nthat can actually print houses.
So these developments\nhave kind of
happened in the past\ncouple of years.
So when we started the\nprinter development in 2016,
this technology was only\navailable in a very limited
way.
And so in the last four\nyears, things have changed
drastically, I would say.
So scaling up becomes more and\nmore feasible and possible.
And so hopefully, the\nnext time we meet,
we can share some of that.
Wonderful.
I'm going to synthesize.
I think we have time for\nabout two more questions.
But for the first one, I'm going\nto synthesize two questions
on the theme of improvisation\non both how much-- there's a--
what one question describes\nis a beautiful kind
of uncanny and improvisational\nposture to the cabin in how--
the way it perches\non the ground.
But this also relates\nto a larger question
of what is the--
a lot of questions on the\nprecision of the lifecycle
of data in a process of\nscanning and making things,
making slices of wood\nthat don't turn out quite
how you expect\nthem to, I'm sure,
and then probably also\nneed to be scanned.
And then where is\ndesign in that process?
And where is improvisation?
And what's the difference\nbetween the two,
between the precision and\nimprecision of a process that,
I'm guessing, resembles\njazz more than Bach?
But maybe you can expand\non that a little bit.
Yeah.
Well, I think the cabin\nis a good example,
because essentially,\nwhat it is is
a feedback between an intended\ndesign and the material,
on the other hand.
So you go into the forest.
You say, OK, roughly,\nI need 10 logs.
Roughly, I want to do\nthis with the wood.
And then you go and\ncut down 10 trees.
And you find things\nthat are similar to what
you had in mind,\nbut in the end, you
don't get exactly what\nyou were shopping for,
as opposed to when\nyou go to Home Depot
and buy a two by four.
You know that if you\nselect the straight one,
it's going to be a two by four.
And so there's a feedback\nbetween the material.
So we would literally\ngo out into the forest
and look at this stuff, and\nhave to then redesign based
on the things that we find.
So that's a kind\nof improvisation
that happens by\ndesign in the cabin,
because the material sort of\nforces that upon the design
process.
So this is a challenge.
It's not easy to think\nthat way and to design
a project that way, because\nthere's this uncertainty
about the material.
So until the very last\nminute, we don't really
know what the cabin\nwill look like due
to some of these factors.
I mean, there is maybe\nthe top down, let's say,
intuition for designers\nand architects.
And then we take full\nadvantage of that.
And so also recognizing there\nare design opportunities
that come from curvature.
Of course, we would\nleverage that, and maybe
exaggerate certain moments,\nespecially the example
of the drain spout.
And so there are this\nsort of top-down desire,
expressive desire that\nwe want to achieve,
and then like Sasa said,\nthere is the feedback
between the material character.
So it's not entirely totally\nopen and total improvisation.
So there is a level of\ncalibration within the process.
We also intentionally\na lot of the time when
it comes to form avoid\nfull optimization,
and not allowing, let's say,\noptimization really play out
the design fully.
And that's also due\nto our partial bias
towards having this\ndesign expression
that we want to play with.
I mean, some of this also has to\ndo with a particular structure
that we work with.
So there's the lab, and\nthen there's the office.
And so the lab does\nfundamental research.
It looks at concrete\nmixtures and collaborates
with researchers,\nand tries to advance
that sort of more\nengineering-based
architectural discourse.
But in the practice,\nwe have the freedom
to bring in other\nnarratives and to, I guess,
sort of contaminate the ideal\noptimized engineered state
of things.
And this is what\nthe cabin really
is, because there's no way\nto sort of optimize this,
or there's no way to justify\nit through optimization.
So there are other narratives,\narchitectural design
narratives, at play\nthat are important here.
And so this is a project\nthat demonstrates
that these two kind of realms\ncan be combined and connected.
So that provides\na good follow-up.
I'm still going\nto allow myself--
questions keep cropping up.
So this will be the\nsecond to last question.
But I'm going to synthesize\na couple of questions
with the observation that\none of Marshall McLuhan's
laws of media is that\nthe future resembles
not the present, but the past\nthat preceded the present.
And so in your rejection\nof optimization, which was,
of course, often part of\nthe language of modern
architecture, if not always\npart of the actual substance
of modern\narchitecture, there's--
and in a lot of the questions,\nthere's questions, for example,
here about questions\nof locality.
Does the idea of looking out\nyour window at your materials
relate to this idea of\nlocalness of architecture,
that outside of modern--
what we've come to expect to be\nglobe-spanning supply chains?
Or does it also--\nit also relates
to a question about\nornamentation and decoration,
which often served a functional\npurpose historically,
but also has a different\nkind of character in the work
that you've shown.
So maybe if you could\nreflect a little bit
on this idea of the past that\npreceded the present, as well
as the future, and how these\nquestions of optimization,
ornamentation, locality\nare potentially challenged
by some of the\nfundamental questions
that your work raises.
[INAUDIBLE]
I don't know.
Maybe the question is not clear.
This is a good question.
Yeah.
I think the locality\nplays a big role,
let's say, in both the\nLog Knot and the cabin.
And one thing is\nthat I don't think
we would have produced the\nwork that we showed today
if we were not in\nIthaca and Cornell,
and what this\ncontext provides us.
And so maybe the role of the\nwood, the role of the situation
with the ash tree, I\nwould say in the beginning
it wasn't something\nthat we see as like, oh,
we need to work with\nsome local material,
but it presented itself\nas an opportunity
for us to think about,\noh, well, now there
is this infestation\nwith the ash trees.
What can we do with it?
And it happened to be a big\nproblem in New York state.
So this actually prompted\nus to think about,
now how can we use\nthese trees locally?
And if this is a resource that\nis all over North America,
how can we--
and in such a\nnon-standardized way,
then how can we develop building\nstrategies that we can actually
upcycle these wood, these logs?
And so then the\ndeserved locality
began to play a much stronger\nrole once we were presented
with this opportunity here.
And also, with the 3D printing\nas well, one of the biggest
advantages, you could\n3D print on-site,
and on-site 3D printing\nhas been happening now
also at the building scale.
Not in our work, but\nas Sasa mentioned.
The challenge, let's\nsay, for our printer
was that our site\nwas extremely uneven.
And 3D printing requires a\nfairly stable flat ground
condition to print.
So the locality topic can\ncome into the local resources.
How do you reuse\nlocal resources?
And also how you can\nprint on-site actually,
the production of\na building on-site
as kind of a local focus.
And that way, that\nalso eliminates
a lot of the transportations,\nand so on and so forth.
So that is-- there is definitely\nthat narrative embedded
in this process.
The question of past, future,\npresent histories in the work,
I think is an interesting one.
And it's a challenging one\nto answer, I would say.
I don't think that there\nis a definitive answer.
I think what we've come to\nenjoy through working much
more in the practice is the\nfreedom to leave things up
for interpretation also,\nwhich I think is something
that we do with the cabin,\nbecause in the practice,
we're not bound to some of\nthe constraints of the lab.
And so I think depending\non who looks at this,
you might have a different\nanswer to your question.
And that's also a good\nthing, I would say.
So that's not\nreally a shortcoming
generally within a\ndiscourse-based discipline.
Well, that's maybe a good prompt\nfor the last question that's
come up.
I mean, I would reflect on the--
we are very sorry not to be\nin the physical space at MIT,
but one of the things that\nthis current improvisation
gives us is the\nability to welcome,
as we have tonight, both\nour current students
and a large segment of our\nalumni into a shared space, as
limited as this can be\ndescribed as a space.
And so it's a nice\nmoment to ask a question
that several people in the\naudience have asked, too.
Maybe just answer very briefly\nwhat about your work is MIT,
or what about your\nwork have you taken
from MIT into these other places\nand ecologies distinctively
as you packed your bag\nfor your journey from here
into your career.
Wow.
So much.
I mean, I think, there's\nthe culture of hacking,
the DIY, make your own machine,\nfigure it out, try it out,
test something, make something.
That is, I think, fundamental\nto MIT and its culture.
But then in the\ndepartment, I think
there's a very rigorous\ncommitment to discourse
and to creating an argument for\na project and honing in on it
and refining it.
And this is at least\nwhat we attempt to do,
not successfully, I\nthink, in all cases,
but that's the ambition.
And so this is sort of what we\ncarry as a package from MIT.
Well, that's a beautiful\nmoment to end on.
So I would say that to all of\nyou watching who we can't see
and who we are very sad not\nto be physically present
with, I would apologize deeply\nfor our own improvisations
tonight.
This is the first time\nany of us have done this.
I'm standing in a\nhouse with a computer
on top of a set of cardboard\nboxes outside of the frame.
And we're all making this\nup as we go along, maybe
hearkening back to the\nbeautiful improvisation,
hopefully, in the work\nthat we've seen tonight.
And so with that\napology also comes again
the enormous gratitude\nfor joining us together
for something whose\nunnecessary qualities are
deeply necessary in this time.
So thank you for bringing\nthe serendipity and grace
of your work to help us create\na little bit of serendipity
and grace here tonight,\non behalf of myself,
but mostly of everyone\nelse watching who doesn't
have the ability to speak.
So thanks guys, I'm\ngoing to give you a hand.
Thank you.
